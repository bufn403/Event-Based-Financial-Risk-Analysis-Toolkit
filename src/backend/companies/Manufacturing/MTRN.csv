7,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2024-02-15,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.  The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.Risks Relating to Economic ConditionsThe businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, consumer electronics, and telecom and data center end markets. Each of these end markets is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, inflation, rising interest rates and the strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the semiconductor, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.6Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, or negative, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, we experienced decreased demand because our customers had excess inventory.Risks Relating to Our Business and OperationsA portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2023, 14% of our value-added sales were to customers in the aerospace and defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets driven by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. Next-generation solutions may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing disruptive thermal spreading materials which requires newer technology that replaces the traditional approach of building package. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and processes which introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may lose customers or otherwise be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products (despite numerous studies affirming the safety of beryllium in these products), and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing materials in their products, the demand for beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales.Our long and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take several years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.7We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including beryllium, tantalum, aluminum, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, tin, iridium, rhodium, niobium, hafnium, and tungsten. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are volatile and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Prices for precious metal and certain non-precious metals including tantalum, nickel, iridium, rhodium, niobium, hafnium and tungsten have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Additionally, geopolitical instability and the inflationary environment have added to the volatility. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales and operating profit.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price or the consignment fee of precious metals and/or copper would increase our costs, negatively impacting our operating profit.We are not dependent on any one supplier for our primary raw materials, but the business could be impacted by supply constraints. If, in the future, we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of metals on a timely basis, we may not be able to obtain metals from alternate sources at competitive prices. In addition, interruptions or reductions in our supply of metals could make it difficult to satisfy our customers’ delivery requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based in part on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. In the past, our gross margin has been reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to theft or employee error.Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error or theft. In the past, we have had precious metal shortages resulting from theft and employee error, which could reoccur in the future.While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are designed ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance. Additionally, while we maintain insurance to cover the theft of our inventory, such coverage may not sufficiently cover any loss.Access to consigned metals may restrict our operationsWe use gold and other precious metals in the production of some of our products. We obtain most precious metals from consignors under consignment agreements. The consignors retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign and the period of consignment. Because we do not control the consigned inventory, we may not be able to access the inventory to meet our forecasted needs, which could adversely impact our results of operations. 8We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment in these facilities, could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of our mine, any of our manufacturing facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment within these facilities for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather (including that caused by climate change), fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event, including a security incident such as a ransomware attack, may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and natural gas, which could be interrupted due to equipment failures, terrorism, or another cause.If such events occur, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business and/or result in lost sales. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.A security incident impacting customer, employee, supplier, or Company information, or Company systems or infrastructure, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems owned by the Company or hosted by third parties, and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, as well as those of third parties who we rely on, and risk the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  We protect our sensitive, confidential, or proprietary information as well as personal data, our facilities, and information technology systems, but we and third parties upon whom we rely to host or protect our data, facilities, and IT systems may be vulnerable to future security incidents. Despite our security measures, the IT systems and infrastructure of the Company and third parties who host or secure our data may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, and exploitable third-party software vulnerabilities or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and those of third parties and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  Attacks impacting our systems or data could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  The Company has taken steps to protect our computer systems; however, there is always a risk of successful intrusions or attacks, and any intrusions or attacks could pose a risk of undetected data loss or theft that could later be used to harm the Company. These security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business. Cyber attacks, vulnerabilities, and disruptions impacting those systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential, proprietary, or personal information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims.Data privacy breaches and the evolving global governmental regulation relating to data privacy could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.The Company is subject to increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal information in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other customer, vendor or employee data.  Laws and regulations addressing personal information, including with respect to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) as amended by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), and other similar United States state privacy laws, and the interpretation and enforcement of these and similar laws and regulations, are continuously evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may develop and the costs and complexity of future compliance.  The interpretation and application of data protection laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing costs as part of our efforts to protect our business data and personal information and comply with applicable law. Any failure, or perceived failure, to comply with our data protection or privacy-related legal obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.  9Our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our financial performance.In 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate the pension benefits for active participants as of January 1, 2020.  The Company has defined benefit pension plans in other non-U.S. locations. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.  Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply elsewhere.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine or manufacturing facilities could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, weather (including severe weather caused by climate change), fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion at our mine or other manufacturing facilities could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.Tax increases and changes in tax laws may adversely affect our financial resultsAs a company conducting business on a global basis with material operations throughout the United States, we are exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the effects of changes in U.S., state, local, and foreign tax laws. Taxes for financial reporting purposes and cash tax liabilities in the future may be adversely affected by changes in such tax laws. Such changes may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our major competitors, to the extent we are unable to pass the tax costs through to our customers.Our success is dependent upon our relationships with certain key customers.Although the Company serves a diverse customer base, a portion of our sales is concentrated amongst a limited number of customers. If we lost one or more of these major customers, or if one or more major customers significantly decreased its orders for our products, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. In fiscal year 2023, one customer accounted for approximately ten percent of our net sales. Our business may be impacted by external factors that we may not be able to control.War, civil conflict, terrorism, other geopolitical and diplomatic tensions, natural disasters, climate change and public health issues including domestic or international pandemics, other outbreaks of contagious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) and other adverse public health developments have caused or could cause damage or disruption to domestic or international commerce by creating economic or political uncertainties. Additionally, the volatility in the financial markets could negatively impact our business. These events could result in a decrease in demand for our products, affect the availability of credit facilities to us, our customers or other members of the supply chain necessary to transact business, make it difficult or impossible to deliver orders to customers or receive materials from suppliers, affect the availability or pricing of energy sources or result in other severe consequences that may or may not be predictable. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters10We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our domestic and international operations. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 51% in 2023, 51% in 2022, and 47% in 2021 of Net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, increasingly complex requirements concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; •fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and•disruptions in our business or the businesses of our suppliers or customers due to cyber security incidents, public health concerns (including viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19), war or other hostilities, or natural disasters.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings; however, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate.We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, and fees or restrictions on certain activities. Compliance with these climate change initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us 11or our industry could harm us. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, or other litigation matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail in the resolution of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits. The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Additionally we, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. In 2018 OHSA issued a final standard for workplace exposure to beryllium. Materion was a participant in the development of the standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional 12costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. The Company is committed to ensuring that our organization’s governance and operations are fully aligned with environmentally and socially responsible practices. We make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through information provided on our website and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, which could be material, and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders also may have very different views on where environmental, social and governance focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.Risks Related to Our DebtA major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition. Additionally, restrictive covenants contained in our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. A global economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.Additionally, the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.Adverse business conditions could impact our ability to generate cash and service our indebtedness.Our ability to pay interest on our debt and to satisfy our other debt obligations depends in part upon our future financial and operating performance and that of our subsidiaries, and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic 13conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, affect our ability to make these payments. While we believe that cash flow from our current level of operations, available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility provide adequate sources of liquidity, a significant drop in operating cash flow resulting from economic conditions, competition or other uncertainties beyond our control could create the need for alternative sources of liquidity. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, we will have to pursue one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital or other expenditures, refinancing debt, selling assets, or raising equity capital.Risks Related to the Execution of Our StrategyWe may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or whether we will be able to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to any acquisitions, including the achievement of any expected synergies. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, or applicable representation and warranty insurance, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected"
4,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2023-02-16,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.  The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.6Risks Relating to Economic ConditionsThe businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, consumer electronics, and telecom and data center end markets. Each of these end markets is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, inflation, rising interest rates and the strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the semiconductor, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, or negative, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Risks Relating to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business.The worldwide spread of the COVID-19 virus resulted in a global slowdown of economic activity which could continue to impact demand for a broad variety of goods and services, including from the Company’s customers, while also continuing to disrupt sales channels and marketing activities for an unknown period of time. New and potentially more contagious variants of the virus have emerged over the course of the pandemic, along with a surge in cases in several regions across the globe, including Europe and Asia, resulting in renewed shutdown, mandatory quarantines and shelter in place orders in certain regions. These events have led, at times, to slowdowns in our operations, including the temporary shutdown of the Company's Shanghai facility in the first half of 2022. Through continued economic challenges, there continue to be periodic shipping and logistics challenges and continued supply chain constraints, shortages and delays, along with inflationary pricing pressures.As normal business operations resume, we continue to practice enhanced sanitation procedures, health checks and social distancing protocols, however, none of these measures can completely eliminate the risk of exposure or spread of COVID-19. There could be additional waves or spikes in infection, again causing widespread social, economic and operational impacts.Further, the lingering impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets in many countries.Any prolonged disruption of manufacturing or shipment of our products caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or any future pandemics could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions. Surges in infection rate, new shutdowns or quarantines, emergence of new and potentially more contagious variants of the virus and staffing and labor supply challenges may impact our suppliers and our ability to source materials in a timely manner. Further, ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressure could have a negative impact on our results.Risks Relating to Our Business and OperationsBecause we experience seasonal fluctuations in certain end-market sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any quarter could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.7A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2022, 16% of our value-added sales were to customers in the aerospace and defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets driven by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. Next-generation solutions may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing disruptive thermal spreading materials which requires newer technology that replaces the traditional approach of building package. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and processes which introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may lose customers or otherwise be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products (despite numerous studies affirming the safety of beryllium in these products), and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing materials in their products, the demand for beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales.Our long and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take several years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including beryllium, tantalum, aluminum, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, tin, iridium, rhodium, niobium, hafnium, and tungsten. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are volatile and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Prices for precious metal and certain non-precious metals including tantalum, nickel, iridium, rhodium, niobium, hafnium and tungsten have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Additionally, geopolitical instability and the inflationary environment 8have added to the volatility. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales and operating profit.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price or the consignment fee of precious metals and/or copper would increase our costs, negatively impacting our operating profit.We are not dependent on any one supplier for our primary raw materials, but the business could be impacted by supply constraints. If, in the future, we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of metals on a timely basis, we may not be able to obtain metals from alternate sources at competitive prices. In addition, interruptions or reductions in our supply of metals could make it difficult to satisfy our customers’ delivery requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based in part on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. In the past, our gross margin has been reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to theft or employee error.Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error or theft. In the past, we have had precious metal shortages resulting from theft and employee error, which could reoccur in the future.While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are designed ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance. Additionally, while we maintain insurance to cover the theft of our inventory, such coverage may not sufficiently cover any loss.Access to consigned metals may restrict our operationsWe use gold and other precious metals in the production of some of our products. We obtain most precious metals from consignors under consignment agreements. The consignors retain ownership of the precious metals and charge us fees based on the amounts we consign and the period of consignment. Because we do not control the consigned inventory, we may not be able to access the inventory to meet our forecasted needs, which could adversely impact our results of operations. We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment in these facilities, could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of our mine, any of our manufacturing facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment within these facilities for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather (including that caused by climate change), fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing 9capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and natural gas, which could be interrupted due to equipment failures, terrorism, or another cause.If such events occur, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business and/or result in lost sales. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.A security breach of customer, employee, supplier, or Company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  We protect our sensitive information and confidential personal data, our facilities, and information technology systems, but we may be vulnerable to future security breaches. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  A security breach of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  The Company has taken steps to protect our computer systems however there is always a risk of undetected successful intrusions.  The Company requires employees to complete information security training programs multiple times a year to reinforce the importance of protecting company information and assets. Materion has not experienced a known information security breach to our systems, however intrusions could pose a risk of undetected data loss or theft that could later be used to harm the Company.   There have been no financial penalties or settlements associated with an information security breach within the last three years.Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business.  A security breach of those computer systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims.Data privacy breaches and the evolving global governmental regulation relating to data privacy could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.We collect, store, access and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary customer and business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed requirements.  The data privacy laws of the specific jurisdictions in which we operate may vary and potentially conflict. As such, we cannot predict the cost of compliance with future data privacy laws, regulations and standards, future interpretations of current laws, regulations and standards, or the potential effects on our business.Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and a violation of data privacy laws or a security breach involving personal data can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.Our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our financial performance.In 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate the pension benefits for active participants as of January 1, 2020.  The Company has defined benefit pension plans in other non-U.S. locations. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.  Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase. We cannot predict whether changing 10market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply elsewhere.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine or manufacturing facilities could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, weather (including severe weather caused by climate change), fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion at our mine or other manufacturing facilities could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.Tax increases and changes in tax rules may adversely affect our financial resultsAs a company conducting business on a global basis with material operations throughout the United States, we are exposed, both directly and indirectly, to the effects of changes in U.S., state, local, and foreign tax rules. Taxes for financial reporting purposes and cash tax liabilities in the future may be adversely affected by changes in such tax rules. Such changes may put us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our major competitors, to the extent we are unable to pass the tax costs through to our customers.The Biden administration has announced in 2021 and 2022, and in certain cases has enacted, a number of tax proposals to fund new government investments in infrastructure, healthcare, and education, among other things. Certain of these proposals involve an increase in the domestic corporate tax rate, which if implemented could have a material impact on our future results of operations and cash flows. Economic and geopolitical instability including as a result of military conflict could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition, and cash flowsGeopolitical conflict may have a global impact on our operations, customers, or suppliers. Conflicts may result in various sanctions, including asset freezes and prohibitions on transactions. These sanctions could have a larger impact that expands into other geographies where we do business, including our supply chain, business partners, and customers in those markets, which could result in lost sales, supply shortages, commodity price fluctuations, increased manufacturing costs, transportation logistics challenges, customer credit and liquidity issues, and lost efficiencies. Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory MattersWe conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our domestic and international operations. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 51% in 2022, 47% in 2021, and 45% in 2020 of Net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, increasingly complex requirements concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; •fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and11•disruptions in our business or the businesses of our suppliers or customers due to cyber security incidents, public health concerns (including viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19), the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine or natural disasters.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings; however, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate.We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, and fees or restrictions on certain activities. Compliance with these climate change initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, or other litigation matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail in the resolution of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.12Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2022, we had one CBD case outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Additionally we, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. OSHA has published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. Materion was a participant in the development of the new standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.Expectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs and other adverse effects on our business.Many governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. The Company is committed to ensuring that our organization’s governance and operations are fully aligned with environmentally and socially responsible practices. We make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through information provided on our website and other communications. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments, which could be material, and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control. In addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders also may have very different views on where environmental, social and governance focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.13Risks Related to Our DebtA major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. A global economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms and amount of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.Adverse business conditions could impact our ability to generate cash and service our indebtedness.Our ability to pay interest on our debt and to satisfy our other debt obligations depends in part upon our future financial and operating performance and that of our subsidiaries, and upon our ability to renew or refinance borrowings. Prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control, affect our ability to make these payments. While we believe that cash flow from our current level of operations, available cash and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility provide adequate sources of liquidity, a significant drop in operating cash flow resulting from economic conditions, competition or other uncertainties beyond our control could create the need for alternative sources of liquidity. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our debt service obligations, we will have to pursue one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying capital or other expenditures, refinancing debt, selling assets, or raising equity capital.Risks Related to the Execution of Our StrategyWe may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or whether we will be able to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to any acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of HCS-Electronic Materials, including the achievement of any expected synergies. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, or applicable representation and warranty insurance, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities 14associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected"
14,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2022-02-17,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORS6Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized.  The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business.We have continued to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including how it has impacted our customers, employees, supply chain and distribution network.  While our business was adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have seen recovery over the course of 2021.  The scope and duration of the pandemic continue to be uncertain, and evolving factors such as the level and timing of vaccine distribution across the world and the extent of any resurgences of the virus or emergence of new variants could impact the stability of the economic recovery and growth. The COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows in a number of ways in the future, including but not limited to: •disruptions to our facilities, including shutdowns or slowdowns as a result of facility closures, reductions in operating hours or labor shortages; •disruptions in our supply chain and our ability to obtain raw materials, packaging and other sourced materials due to labor shortages, governmental restrictions or the failure of our suppliers, distributors or manufacturers to meet their obligations to us;•increases in raw material and commodity costs;•the inability of a significant portion of our workforce, including our management team, to work as a result of illness or government restrictions; and reduced liquidity of customers, which could negatively impact the collectability of outstanding receivables and our cash flows.The extent to which our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows may ultimately be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend largely on these future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed below, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.Risks Relating to Economic ConditionsThe businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, consumer electronics, and telecom and data center end markets. Each of these end markets is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the semiconductor, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, or negative, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Risks Relating to Our Business and OperationsBecause we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any quarter could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.7A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2021, 12% of our value-added sales were to customers in the aerospace and defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions comprised of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may lose customers or otherwise be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products (despite numerous studies affirming the safety of beryllium in these products), and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing materials in their products, the demand for beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales.Our long and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take several years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including beryllium, tantalum, aluminum, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are volatile and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Precious metal prices have fluctuated significantly in recent years and the inflationary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has added to the volatility. Higher prices can cause adjustments to 8our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales and operating profit.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price or the consignment fee of precious metals and/or copper could increase our financing costs, which would increase our operating costs.Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based in part on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. In the past, our gross margin has been reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error or theft.Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error or theft. In the past, we have had precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft, which could reoccur in the future.While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are designed ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance. Additionally, while we maintain insurance to cover the theft of our inventory, such coverage may not sufficiently cover any loss.We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment in these facilities, could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of our mine, any of our manufacturing facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment within these facilities for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather (including that caused by climate change), fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and natural gas, which could be interrupted due to equipment failures, terrorism, or another cause.If such events occur, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business and/or result in lost sales. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.9A security breach of customer, employee, supplier, or Company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  We protect our sensitive information and confidential personal data, our facilities, and information technology systems, but we may be vulnerable to future security breaches. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  A security breach of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  The Company has taken steps to protect our computer systems however there is always a risk of undetected successful intrusions.  Intrusions could pose a risk of undetected data loss or theft that could later be used to harm the Company.  In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings and/or liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties is misappropriated from our computer systems. Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business.  A security breach of those computer systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims.Data privacy breaches and the evolving global governmental regulation relating to data privacy could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.We collect, store, access and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary customer and business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer-imposed requirements.  The data privacy laws of the specific jurisdictions in which we operate may vary and potentially conflict. As such, we cannot predict the cost of compliance with future data privacy laws, regulations and standards, future interpretations of current laws, regulations and standards, or the potential effects on our business.Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and a violation of data privacy laws or a security breach involving personal data can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our results of operations and profitability.Our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our financial performance.In 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate the pension benefits for active participants as of January 1, 2020.  The Company has defined benefit pension plans in other non-U.S. locations. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.  Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply elsewhere.10Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine or manufacturing facilities could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, weather (including severe weather caused by climate change), fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion at our mine or other manufacturing facilities could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory MattersWe conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our domestic and international operations. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 47% in 2021, 45% in 2020, and 37% in 2019 of Net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, increasingly complex requirements concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; •fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and•disruptions in our business or the businesses of our suppliers or customers due to cyber security incidents, public health concerns (including viral outbreaks, such as COVID-19) or natural disasters.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings; however, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.11Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate.We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.Growing concerns about climate change may result in the imposition of additional regulations or restrictions to which we may become subject. A number of governments or governmental bodies have introduced or are contemplating regulatory changes in response to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions. The outcome of new legislation or regulation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions in which we operate may result in new or additional requirements, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, and fees or restrictions on certain activities. Compliance with these climate change initiatives may also result in additional costs to us, including, among other things, increased production costs, additional taxes, reduced emission allowances or additional restrictions on production or operations. Any adopted future climate change regulations could also negatively impact our ability to compete with companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Even without such regulation, increased public awareness and adverse publicity about potential impacts on climate change emanating from us or our industry could harm us. We may not be able to recover the cost of compliance with new or more stringent laws and regulations, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, or other litigation matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail in the resolution of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2021, we had two CBD cases outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, 12and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities, or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. OSHA has published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. Materion was a participant in the development of the new standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.Risks Related to Our DebtA major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. A global economic downturn could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.13The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.Risks Related to the Execution of Our StrategyWe may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or whether we will be able to achieve the strategic and other objectives related to any acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of HCS-Electronic Materials, including the achievement of any expected synergies. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, or applicable representation and warranty insurance, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected"
12,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2021-02-18,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many 6are interrelated. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.Risks Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic Our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. In December 2019, there was an outbreak of a novel strain of COVID-19 in China that has since spread to the majority of the regions of the world.  The outbreak was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. To date, the COVID-19 outbreak and preventative measures taken to contain or mitigate the outbreak have caused, and are continuing to cause, business slowdowns or shutdowns in affected areas and significant disruption in global financial markets. Although we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 outbreak at this time, the pandemic has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.  Such effects may be material and the potential impacts include, but are not limited to: •disruptions to our facilities, including as a result of facility closures, reductions in operating hours, labor shortages, and changes in operating procedures, including additional cleaning and disinfecting procedures; •disruptions in our supply chain due to transportation delays, travel restrictions, raw material cost increases, and closures of businesses or facilities; •reductions in our operating effectiveness due to workforce disruptions resulting from “shelter in place,” “stay at home” orders, the need for social distancing, and the unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities; and •volatility in the global financial markets, which could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital and additional sources of financing in the future.  In addition, we cannot predict the impact that COVID-19 will have on our customers, employees, suppliers, and distributors, and any adverse impacts on these parties may have a material adverse impact on our business. The impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed below, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.Risks Relating to Economic ConditionsThe businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, consumer electronics, and telecom and data center end markets. Each of these end markets is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the semiconductor, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, or negative, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Risks Relating to Our Business and OperationsBecause we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any quarter could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.7A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2020, 13% of our value-added sales was derived from sales to customers in the aerospace and defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions comprised of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products (despite numerous studies affirming the safety of beryllium in these products), and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing materials in their products, the demand for beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales.Our long and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take several years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, 8whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales and operating profit.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price or the consignment fee of precious metals and/or copper could increase our financing costs, which would increase our operating costs.Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based in part on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. In the past, our gross margin has been reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error or theft.Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error or theft. In the past, we have had precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft, which could reoccur in the future.While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are designed ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance. Additionally, while we maintain insurance to cover the theft of our inventory, such coverage may not sufficiently cover any loss.We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment in these facilities, could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of our mine, any of our manufacturing facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment within these facilities for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather, fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and natural gas, which could be interrupted due to equipment failures, terrorism, or another cause.If such events occur, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business and/or result in lost sales. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.9A security breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  A security breach of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings and/or liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties is misappropriated from our computer systems.Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business.  A security breach of those computer systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims.Our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our financial performance.In 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate the pension benefits for active participants as of January 1, 2020.  The Company has defined benefit pension plans in other non-U.S. locations. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.  Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, weather, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.Risks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory MattersWe conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 45% in 2020, 37% in 2019, and 40% in 2018 of Net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, increasingly complex 10requirements concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; •fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and•disruptions in our business or the businesses of our suppliers or customers due to cyber security incidents, public health concerns (including viral outbreaks, such as the coronavirus) or natural disasters.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings; however, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the current U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. If the current U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, or other litigation matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the resolution of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Some people who are diagnosed with 11CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2020, we had two CBD cases outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities, or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. OSHA has published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. Materion was a participant in the development of the new standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.Risks Related to Our DebtA major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained 12the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. In the event of a global economic downturn, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over that we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.Risks Related to the Execution of Our StrategyWe may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other 13product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected"
0,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2020-02-13,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the semiconductor, industrial, aerospace and defense, automotive, energy, consumer electronics, and telecom and data center end markets. Each of these end markets is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the semiconductor, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, or negative, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any quarter could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2019, 17% of our value-added sales was derived from sales to customers in the aerospace and defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.5The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices.

The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales and operating profit.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price or the consignment fee of precious metals and/or copper could increase our financing costs, which would increase our operating costs.6Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based in part on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. In the past, our gross margin has been reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error or theft.Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error or theft. In the past, we have had precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft, which could reoccur in the future.While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are designed ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance.We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment in these facilities, could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California; and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of our mine, any of our manufacturing facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment within these facilities for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather, fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and natural gas, which could be interrupted due to equipment failures, terrorism, or another cause.If such events occur, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business and/or result in lost sales. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could adversely impact our financial performance.Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to credit markets be reduced, customers may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, thereby impacting our sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and/or delivered. Negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability, and results of operations. If current global economic conditions deteriorate, it could trigger an economic downturn of the same or greater severity as the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our sales and result in potential non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges.Our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our financial performance.In 2019, the Company's Board of Directors approved changes to the U.S. defined benefit pension plan. The Company froze the pay and service amounts used to calculate the pension benefits for active participants as of January 1, 2020.  The Company has defined benefit pension plans in other non-U.S. locations. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, 7and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.  Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. In the event of a global economic downturn, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over that we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested 8when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 37% in 2019, 40% in 2018, and 44% in 2017 of Net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, increasingly complex requirements concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; •fluctuations in currency exchange rates; and•disruptions in our business or the businesses of our suppliers or customers due to cyber security incidents, public health concerns (including viral outbreaks, such as the coronavirus) or natural disasters.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings; however, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.9Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the current U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. If the current U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, or other litigation matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the resolution of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2019, we had one CBD case outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities, or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. OSHA has published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. Materion was a participant in the development of the new standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the 10new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, weather, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.A security breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  A security breach of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings and/or liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties is misappropriated from our computer systems.Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business.  A security breach of those computer systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims"
5,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2019-02-14,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer electronics, industrial components, medical, automotive electronics, defense, telecommunications infrastructure, energy, commercial aerospace, and science markets. Each of these markets is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, or negative, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas season generates increased demand from our customers that manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any quarter could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2018, 10% of our value-added sales was derived from sales to customers in the defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions comprised of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.6The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products, and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing materials in their products, the demand for beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales.Our long and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take several years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales and operating profit.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price or the consignment fee of precious metals, and/or copper, could increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based in part on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. In the past, our gross margin has been reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error or theft.Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error or theft. In the past, we have had precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft, which could reoccur in the future.7While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are structured ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance.We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment in these facilities, could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California; and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of our mine, any of our manufacturing facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment within these facilities for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather, fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and natural gas, which could be interrupted due to equipment failures, terrorism, or another cause.If such events occur, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business and/or result in lost sales. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could adversely impact our financial performance.Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to credit markets be reduced, customers may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, thereby impacting our sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and/or delivered. Negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability, and results of operations. If current global economic conditions deteriorate, it could trigger an economic downturn of the same or greater severity as the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our sales and result in potential non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges.Our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our financial performance.We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.  Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""8Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. In the event of a global economic downturn, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over that we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.9We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 40% in 2018, 44% in 2017, and 34% in 2016 of Net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, increasingly complex requirements concerning privacy and data security, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and•fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings; however, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the current U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. If the current U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, or other litigation matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the resolution of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain 10judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2018, we had one CBD case outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities, or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. OSHA has published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. Materion was a participant in the development of the new standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.11Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, weather, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.A security breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  A security breach of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties is misappropriated from our computer systems.Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business.  A security breach of those computer systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims"
1,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2018-02-15,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer electronics, industrial components, medical, automotive electronics, defense, telecommunications infrastructure, energy, commercial aerospace, and science markets. Each of these markets is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, or negative, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas season generates increased demand from our customers that manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any quarter could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2017, 9% of our value-added sales was derived from sales to customers in the defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions comprised of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our sales.6In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products, and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing materials in their products, the demand for beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales.Our long and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take several years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales and operating profit.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price or the consignment fee of precious metals, and/or copper, could increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based in part on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. For example, our 2013 gross margin was reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment totaling $2.2 million at our Albuquerque, New Mexico facility within the Advanced Materials segment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error and theft.Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft. For example, in 2013, the Company filed a claim with its insurance carrier for a theft of approximately $10.0 million of silver at its Albuquerque, New Mexico refinery, which was settled for $6.8 million in the second quarter of 2014.7While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are structured ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance.We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment in these facilities, could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California; and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of our mine, any of our manufacturing facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment within these facilities for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather, fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and natural gas, which could be interrupted due to equipment failures, terrorism, or another cause.If such events occur, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business and/or result in lost sales. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could adversely impact our financial performance.Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to credit markets be reduced, customers may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, thereby impacting our sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and/or delivered. Negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability, and results of operations. If current global economic conditions deteriorate, it could trigger an economic downturn of the same or greater severity as the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our sales and result in potential non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges.Our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our financial performance.We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.  Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging strategy to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""8Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. In the event of a global economic downturn, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over that we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.9We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. We have been and are continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 44% in 2017, 34% in 2016, and 38% in 2015 of Net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and•fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings; however, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the current U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. If the current U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, or other litigation matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the resolution of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.10If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2017, we had one CBD case outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities, or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. On January 9, 2017, OSHA published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping. Materion was a participant in the development of the new standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, weather, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or injuries to 11employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.A security breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global information technology (IT) security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  A security breach of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties is misappropriated from our computer systems.Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business.  A security breach of those computer systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims"
16,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2017-02-17,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer electronics, industrial components, medical, automotive electronics, defense, telecommunications infrastructure, energy, commercial aerospace, and science markets. Each of these markets is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, or negative, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas season generates increased demand from our customers that manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any quarter could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2016, 9% of our value-added sales was derived from sales to customers in the defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions comprised of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.6The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our net sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products, and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand for beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our net sales.Our long and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take up to two or three years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales and operating profit.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price or the consignment fee of precious metals, and/or copper, could increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. For example, our 2013 gross margin was reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment totaling $2.2 million at our Albuquerque, New Mexico facility within the Advanced Materials segment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error and theft.Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee 7error and theft. For example, in 2013, the Company filed a claim with its insurance carrier for a theft of approximately $10.0 million of silver at its Albuquerque, New Mexico refinery, which was settled for $6.8 million in the second quarter of 2014.While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are structured ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance.We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment in these facilities, could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California; and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of our mine, any of our manufacturing facilities, or to critical pieces of equipment within these facilities for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather, fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and natural gas, which could be interrupted due to equipment failures, terrorism, or another cause.If such events occur, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business and/or result in lost sales. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could adversely impact our financial performance.Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to credit markets be reduced, customers may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, thereby impacting our net sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered and/or delivered. Negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability, and results of operations. If current global economic conditions deteriorate, it could trigger an economic downturn of the same severity as the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our sales.Our defined benefit pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans are subject to financial market risks that could adversely impact our financial performance.We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate.  Significant changes in market interest rates and decreases in the fair value of plan assets and investment losses on plan assets would increase funding requirements and expenses and may adversely impact our results of operations.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.Our financial results are likely to be negatively impacted by an impairment of goodwill should our shareholder equity exceed our market capitalization for a number of quarters.A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reduction in actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill balance at December 31, 2016 was $87.0 million. Any required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reduce this balance and have a material adverse impact on our reported financial position and results of operations.A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.8Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging strategy to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. In the event of a global economic downturn, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over that we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing niche acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our net sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties 9with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. We have been and are continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 34% in 2016, 38% in 2015, and 35% in 2014 of net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and•fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. We may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings; however, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. In particular, there may be significant changes in U.S. laws and regulations and existing international trade agreements by the new U.S. presidential administration that could affect a wide variety of industries and businesses, including those businesses we own and operate. It remains unclear what the new U.S. presidential administration will do, if anything, with respect to existing laws, regulations, or trade agreements. If the new U.S. presidential administration materially modifies U.S. laws and regulations and international trade agreements, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected.We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties, or other litigation matters. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the resolution of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse 10ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2016, we had one CBD case outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities, or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. On January 9, 2017, OSHA published a new standard for workplace exposure to beryllium that, among other things, lowered the permissible exposure by a factor of ten and established new requirements for respiratory protection, personal protective clothing and equipment, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recordkeeping.  Materion was a participant in the development of the new standards, which fundamentally represent our current health and safety operating practices. Other government and standard-setting organizations are also reviewing beryllium-related worker safety rules and standards, and will likely make them more stringent. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future 11environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.In December 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed amendment to section 108(b) of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which is focused on developing financial assurance for managing hazardous substances in the hardrock mining industry. The proposed rule would require subject facilities, such as our bertrandite ore mining operations, to, among other things, calculate their level of financial responsibility and secure an instrument or otherwise self-assure for the calculated amount. Although we do not yet know the financial impact this rule, if adopted, would have on us, an obligation to secure and maintain financial assurance for our bertrandite ore mining operations could have a material adverse impact to our business.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, weather, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.A security breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  A security breach of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties is misappropriated from our computer systems.Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business.  A security breach of those computer systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims"
3,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2016-02-25,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer electronics, industrial components, medical, automotive electronics, defense, telecommunications infrastructure, energy, commercial aerospace, and science industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets are lower, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas season generates increased demand from our customers that manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any quarter could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in other periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2015, 8% of our value-added sales was derived from sales to customers in the defense end market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue. Furthermore, significant reductions to defense spending could occur over the next several years due to government spending cuts, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions comprised of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.7The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our net sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products, and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand for beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our net sales.Our long and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take up to two or three years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of U.S. and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products will generally increase in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price of precious metals or the consignment fee could increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.Utilizing precious metals in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. For example, our 2013 gross margin was reduced by a net quarterly physical inventory adjustment totaling $2.2 million at our Albuquerque, New Mexico facility within the Advanced Materials segment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.8Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed. Any significant deficiency or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements. As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing on favorable terms or at all could be materially and adversely affected. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our securities, and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error and theft.  Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft. For example, in 2013, the Company filed a claim with its insurance carrier for a theft of approximately $10 million of silver at its Albuquerque, New Mexico refinery, which was settled for $6.8 million in the second quarter of 2014. While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are structured ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance.  We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California; and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of any of our manufacturing facilities or our mine for a significant period of time as a result of harsh weather, fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Equipment failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our customers’ demands, which could harm our net sales and cause our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures, which may have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities.Many of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in 9service from one or more of our energy suppliers due to equipment failures, terrorism, or any other cause may result in substantial losses that are not fully covered by our business interruption insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to meet our customers’ demands and reduce our net sales.If the price of electrical power, fuel, or other energy sources increases, our operating expenses could increase significantly.We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel, or other energy sources. Our operating expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices, including natural gas prices. Prices for electricity and natural gas may increase and can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase energy at historical market rates. While we have some long-term contracts with energy suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter into forward-fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and electricity for use in our operations, those contracts are of limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel or electricity needs. Additionally, price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as those increases that may occur from climate change legislation or other environmental mandates, may increase our cost of operations.Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could adversely impact our financial performance.Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to credit markets be reduced, customers may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, thereby impacting our net sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered. Negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability, and results of operations. If current global economic conditions deteriorate, it could trigger an economic downturn of the same severity as the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our sales.A lower interest rate environment coupled with less than expected investment performance may require us to increase our pension liability and expense, which may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and divert funds from other potential uses.We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate. Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly increase the unfunded liability of our plans. Should the pension asset return fall below our expectations, it is likely that future pension expenses would increase. The actual return on our plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2015 was a loss of approximately 3.0%.  For pension accounting purposes in 2015, we assumed a 7.25% expected rate of return on pension assets.We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.  As of December 31, 2015, for pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 4.375% discount rate for our domestic defined benefit plan compared to 4.0% as of December 31, 2014. Based on current guidelines, assumptions, and estimates, including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate that we will make cash contributions of approximately $16.0 million to our pension plan in 2016. If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, contributions in 2016 and beyond may be greater than our current or future projections.We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.Our expenditures for post-employment health benefits could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase.  At December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we assumed rates of 7.0%.  We have assumed that this health care cost increase trend rate will decline in 0.5% increments to the ultimate trend rate of 5.0% by 2020.10Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased the post-employment benefit obligation by $0.3 million at December 31, 2015.We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.Our financial results are likely to be negatively impacted by an impairment of goodwill should our shareholder equity exceed our market capitalization for a number of quarters.A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reduction in actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill balance at December 31, 2015 was $86.7 million. Any required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reduce this balance and have a material adverse impact on our reported financial position and results of operations.A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging strategy to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.""We may be unable to access the financial markets on favorable terms.The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would increase our capital costs. In particular, the substantial volatility in world capital markets due to the 2008 and 2009 global economic crisis has had a significant negative impact on the global financial markets.We rely on access to financial markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash on hand or operating cash flow. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including:•changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms;•a deterioration of our credit;•a deterioration in the financial condition of the banks with which we do business;•extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or credit requirements; and•the collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our flexibility in raising additional capital.These factors have adversely impacted our access to the financial markets from time to time. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions may make it difficult for us to access the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, to the extent necessary, on satisfactory terms or at all.Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. In the event of a global economic downturn, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over that we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross-defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding 11debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We are active in pursuing niche acquisitions. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance.Although our Board of Directors currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the Board's assessment of our operations, financial condition, projected liabilities, our compliance with contractual restrictions in our credit agreement, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, and other factors.  We cannot guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends at the same or similar rates.We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may negatively affect our financial performance.A significant portion of our net sales is conducted in international markets and priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United States (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to 38% of net sales in 2015, 35% in 2014, and 31% in 2013. Significant fluctuations in currency values relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our financial performance. In the past, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro and the yen, have impacted our sales, margins, and profitability. For example, during 2015, our competitors' pricing in euros and yen had a competitive advantage due to the strong U.S. dollar. The fair value of our net assets relating to outstanding foreign currency contracts was $0.3 million at December 31, 2015, indicating that the average hedge rates were favorable compared to the actual year-end market exchange rates. While we may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s net euro and yen exposure, which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations. Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products, and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our net sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties 12with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adequately address information security issues.We have taken measures to protect the integrity of our technology infrastructure and the privacy of confidential information. However, our technology infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, or similar problems. If a person or entity circumvents our security measures, they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems, misappropriate proprietary information, or cause interruptions in our operations. Interruptions in our operations could adversely affect our results.  Additionally, we may be required to make substantial additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches. Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability, and any additional investment to remedy or prevent such breaches could harm our financial condition and operating results.We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. We have been and are continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) accounted for approximately 38% in 2015, 35% in 2014, and 31% in 2013 of net sales. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the U.S. Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and•fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations or other anti-bribery laws, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, compliance costs, and enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.13We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, and claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the conclusion of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.Although we have insurance which may be applicable in certain circumstances, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease (CBD). Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2015, we had one CBD case outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities, or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are under review by OSHA, the Department of Energy, and by other U.S. and foreign governmental and private standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards. Some organizations, such as the California Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of OSHA. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the 14effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.Natural disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages, bankruptcies, and other unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail production or shut down their operations.Our customers’ manufacturing operations are subject to conditions beyond their control, including raw material shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting the automotive industry, which is one of our major markets, and other unexpected events. Catastrophic events could also affect other suppliers to our customers, or could cause our customers to curtail production or to shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their demand for our products and reduce our net sales.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly harm our operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may directly impact our facilities. For example, our Elmore, Ohio facility is located near, and derives power from, a nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist attack. In addition, terrorist attacks, related armed conflicts, or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East or other regions of the world could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets, which could negatively impact our net sales.A security breach of customer, employee, supplier, or company information may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In the conduct of our business, we collect, use, transmit, store, and report data on information systems and interact with customers, vendors, and employees.  Increased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of our data.  Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to customer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches caused by employee error or malfeasance, or other disruptions.  Any such threat could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost, or stolen.  A security breach of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation, resulting in a loss of sales, operating profits, and assets.  In addition, we could be subject to legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information and regulatory penalties if confidential information relating to customers, suppliers, employees, or other parties is misappropriated from our computer systems.Similar security threats exist with respect to the IT systems of our lenders, suppliers, consultants, advisers, and other third parties with whom we conduct business.  A security breach of those computer systems could result in the loss, theft, or disclosure of confidential information and could also interrupt or damage our operations, harm our reputation, and subject us to legal claims"
18,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2015-02-27,">Item 1A.    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be negatively impacted.The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer electronics, industrial components, commercial aerospace, automotive electronics, defense, medical, energy, and telecommunications infrastructure industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics, and oil and gas industries, the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment, and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets slow down, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas season generates increased demand from our customers that manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand, and other occurrences in any of the other quarters could also harm our results of operations. For example, we have experienced customers building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in previous periods, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended, canceled, or delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2014, 6% of our value-added sales was derived from sales to customers in the defense market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue.  For example, value-added sales to the defense market were approximately 23% lower in 2014 compared to 2013.  The decline in value-added sales resulted from push-outs, largely due to government delays and spending cuts.  Furthermore, significant additional reductions to defense spending could occur over the next decade, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. For example, high-margin defense application delays and/or push-outs may adversely impact our results of operations, including quarterly earnings.The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions composed of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance, and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.8We are dependent on our beryllium pebble facility for our future supply of pure beryllium.In 2008, we entered into an agreement with the Department of Defense to share in the cost of the beryllium pebble plant in Elmore, Ohio for primary beryllium feedstock. This beryllium pebble facility commenced operations in 2013. Manufacturing inefficiencies, start-up and maintenance costs, and inconsistent production levels resulted in disruptions to material flow and lower gross margins in 2013. While we believe that we addressed these issues in 2014, our earnings may be impacted by plant manufacturing inefficiencies in the future. Temporary interruptions to make necessary repairs and any delay in further transitioning the operation to run at required production levels could negatively impact our net sales and/or cost structure.The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our net sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium, and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products, and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our net sales.Our lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take up to two or three years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver, and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of United States and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages, and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have fluctuated significantly in recent years. Higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, which could have a greater impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products has increased in tandem with rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our net sales.Further, we maintain some precious metals and copper on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals and copper charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price of precious metals or the consignment fee could increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.Utilizing precious metal in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious, and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material 9impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. For example, our 2013 and 2012 gross margins were reduced by net quarterly physical inventory adjustments totaling $2.2 million and $7.4 million, respectively, at our Albuquerque, New Mexico facility within the Advanced Materials segment. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.Our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting may be insufficient to allow us to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, and this could cause our financial statements to become materially misleading and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. We are required to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial statements and effectively prevent fraud, our financial statements could become materially misleading, which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. If we are not able to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, including any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be harmed. Any significant deficiency or material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting could affect investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements. As a result, our ability to obtain any additional financing, or additional financing on favorable terms, could be materially and adversely affected. This, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and the market value of our securities and require us to incur additional costs to improve our internal control systems and procedures.  Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error and theft.  Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft. For example, in 2013, the Company filed a claim with its insurance carrier for a theft of approximately $10 million of silver at its Albuquerque, New Mexico refinery, which was settled for $6.8 million in the second quarter of 2014. While we maintain controls to prevent theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are structured ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures, and insurance.  We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California; and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of any of our manufacturing facilities or our mine for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism, or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business, and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Equipment failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions, or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our customers’ demands, which could harm our net sales and cause our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures, which may have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities.10Many of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures, terrorism, or any other cause may result in substantial losses that are not fully covered by our business interruption insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to meet our customers’ demands and reduce our net sales.If the price of electrical power, fuel, or other energy sources increases, our operating expenses could increase significantly.We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel, or other energy sources. Our operating expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices, including natural gas prices. Prices for electricity and natural gas may increase and can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase energy at historical market rates. While we have some long-term contracts with energy suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter into forward-fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and electricity for use in our operations, those contracts are of limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel or electricity needs. Additionally, price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as those increases which may occur from climate change legislation or other environmental mandates, may increase our cost of operations.Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could adversely impact our financial performance.Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to credit markets be reduced, customers may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, thereby impacting our net sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered. Negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability, and results of operations. If current global economic conditions deteriorate, it could trigger an economic downturn similar to the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our net sales. A lower interest rate environment coupled with less than expected investment performance may require us to increase our pension liability and expense, which may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and divert funds from other potential uses.We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets, and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate. Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly increase the unfunded liability of our plans. Should the pension asset return fall below our expectations, it is likely that future pension expenses would increase. The actual return on our plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2014 was a gain of approximately 3.7%.  For pension accounting purposes in 2014, we assumed a 7.25% expected rate of return on pension assets.We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.  As of December 31, 2014, for pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 4.0% discount rate for our domestic defined benefit plan compared to 4.875% as of December 31, 2013. Based on current guidelines, assumptions, and estimates, including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate that we will make cash contributions of approximately $16.0 million to our pension plan in 2015. If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, contributions in 2015 and beyond may be greater than our current or future projections.We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.Our expenditures for post-employment health benefits could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.11We provide post-employment health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase.  At December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, we assumed rates of 7.0% and 7.5%, respectively, for each of the following years.  We have assumed that this health care cost increase trend rate will decline in 0.5% increments to the ultimate trend rate of 5.0% by 2019.Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased the post-employment benefit obligation by $0.4 million at December 31, 2014.We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes, or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.Our financial results are likely to be negatively impacted by an impairment of goodwill should our shareholder equity exceed our market capitalization for a number of quarters.A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reduction in actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill balance at December 31, 2014 was $86.7 million. Any required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reduce this balance and have a material adverse impact on our reported financial position and results of operations.A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging strategy to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A ""Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk"".We may be unable to access the financial markets on favorable terms.The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would increase our capital costs. In particular, the substantial volatility in world capital markets due to the global economic crisis has had a significant negative impact on the global financial markets.We rely on access to financial markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash on hand or operating cash flow. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including:•changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms;•a deterioration of our credit;•a deterioration in the financial condition of the banks with which we do business;•extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or credit requirements; and•the collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our flexibility in raising additional capital.These factors have adversely impacted our access to the financial markets from time to time. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions may make it difficult for us to access the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, to the extent necessary, on satisfactory terms or at all.Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. In the event of a global economic downturn, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely 12affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses, and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies, and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We have been active over the last several years in pursuing niche acquisitions. For example, we completed the acquisition of Aerospace Metal Composites Ltd. in 2012. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size, and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible, or sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance.Although our Board of Directors currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the Board's assessment of our operations, financial condition, projected liabilities, our compliance with contractual restrictions in our credit agreement, restrictions imposed by applicable laws, and other factors.  We cannot guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends at the same or similar rates.We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may negatively affect our financial performance.A significant portion of our net sales is conducted in international markets and priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United States (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to 35% of net sales in 2014 and 31% in both 2013 and 2012. Significant fluctuations in currency values relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our financial performance. In the past, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro and the yen, have impacted our sales, margins, and profitability. The fair value of our net asset relating to outstanding foreign currency contracts was $3.5 million at December 31, 2014, indicating that the average hedge rates were favorable compared to the actual year-end market exchange rates. While we may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s complete exposure which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications, and may contain undetected defects, errors, or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our 13customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs, and other losses to our customers, end users, or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our net sales.In addition to the risk of unanticipated warranty or recall expenses, our customer contracts may contain provisions that could cause us to incur penalties, be liable for damages, including liquidated damages, or incur other expenses, if we experience difficulties with respect to the functionality, deployment, operation, and availability of our products and services. In the event of late deliveries, late or improper installations or operations, failure to meet product or performance specifications or other product defects, or interruptions or delays in our managed service offerings, our customer contracts may expose us to penalties, liquidated damages, and other liabilities. In the event we were to incur contractual penalties, such as liquidated damages or other related costs that exceed our expectations, our business, financial condition, and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.Our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adequately address information security issues.We have taken measures to protect the integrity of our technology infrastructure and the privacy of confidential information. However, our technology infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, or similar problems. If a person or entity circumvents our security measures, they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems, misappropriate proprietary information, or cause interruptions in our operations. Interruptions in our operations could adversely affect our results.  Additionally, we may be required to make substantial additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches. Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability.We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. We have been and are continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia. Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 35% in 2014 and 31% of our net sales in both 2013 and 2012. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our net sales for the foreseeable future. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to approximately 22% of our net sales in 2014, 18% of our net sales in 2013, and 16% in 2012. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements, and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and•fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.14Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations, or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, compliance costs, and enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium, and claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the conclusion of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, or financial condition.We are presently uninsured for beryllium-related claims where the claimants’ first exposure to beryllium occurred on or after January 1, 2008, and we have not undertaken to estimate the impact of any such claims, which have yet to be asserted. In addition, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation, and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate, and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts, or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee, and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2014, we had one CBD case outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign, and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities, or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are under review by OSHA, the Department of Energy, and by other U.S. and foreign governmental and private standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards. Some organizations, such as the California Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of OSHA. The development, proposal, or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the 15new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use, and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling, and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.Natural disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages, bankruptcies, and other unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail production or shut down their operations.Our customers’ manufacturing operations are subject to conditions beyond their control, including raw material shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting the automotive industry, which is one of our major markets, and other unexpected events. For example, the tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011 caused wide-scale destruction of the Tohoku region and led most manufacturers in the area, most notably those in the automotive and consumer electronics markets, to slow or halt production. Similar events could also affect other suppliers to our customers. Such events could cause our customers to curtail production or to shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their demand for our products and reduce our net sales.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures, and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly harm our operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may directly impact our facilities. For example, our Elmore, Ohio facility is located near, and derives power from, a nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist attack. In addition, terrorist attacks, related armed conflicts, or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East or other regions of the world could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets, which could negatively impact our net sales"
2,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2014-03-14,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted.The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer electronics, industrial components and commercial aerospace, automotive electronics, defense and science, medical, energy, telecommunications infrastructure and appliance industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics and computer industries and the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets slow down, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas season generates increased demand from our customers that manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand and other occurrences in any of the other quarters could also harm our results of operations. For example, toward the end of 2010, customers were building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in the same period of 2011, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended or canceled, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2013, 6% of our revenue was derived from sales to customers in the defense and science market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue.  For example, sales to the defense and science market were approximately 11% lower in 2013 compared to 2012.  The fall-off resulted from a decline in value-added sales of optics, largely due to government delays and spending cuts.  Furthermore, significant additional reductions to defense spending could occur over the next decade, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions composed of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.8We are dependent on our new primary beryllium facility for our future supply of pure beryllium.In 2008, we entered into an agreement with the Department of Defense to share in the cost of a new beryllium plant for primary beryllium feedstock. Installation and start-up of our new beryllium facility continued throughout 2012 and into 2013 at the Elmore, Ohio plant site.  Manufacturing inefficiencies, start-up and maintenance costs and inconsistent production levels resulted in disruptions to the material flow and lower gross margins.  A number of these issues continued into 2013.Construction was completed in 2012, and we are ramping up production, but temporary interruptions to make necessary repairs and any delay in further transitioning the operation to run at required production levels could negatively impact our sales and/or cost structure.The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales.Our lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take up to two or three years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of United States and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have increased significantly in recent years. These higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, to have a greater impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products has increased in tandem with the rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our sales.Further, we maintain some precious metals on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price of precious metals or the consignment fee could increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.Utilizing precious metal in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory count. Those estimates are based on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. For example, during the second and third quarters of 2013, procedural errors occurred in the recording of the results of the Company's regular quarterly physical inventory count.  The errors understated 9the Company's book-to-physical adjustment and, therefore, understated cost of sales in the second and third quarters of 2013.  As a result, 2013 second and third quarter net income was overstated by approximately $4.8 million and $0.1 million, respectively.  Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any potential inventory long or short.We have determined that a material weakness exists in our system of internal control over financial reporting, which could have a material impact on our business.  Our ability to implement our business plan and comply with regulations requires an effective planning and management process.  We expect that we will need to improve existing operational and financial systems, procedures and controls, and implement new ones, to manage our future business effectively.  Any implementation delays, or disruption in the transition to new or enhanced systems, procedures or controls, could harm our ability to forecast sales, manage our supply chain, and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.We are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Based on our assessment, management identified a deficiency in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that constitutes a material weakness as of December 31, 2013.  Specifically, our management review controls failed to detect errors in the physical inventory count reconciliation process at one of our facilities on a timely basis during interim periods of 2013.  As a result of this material weakness, management concluded that we did not maintain effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.  Until the control deficiency is fully remediated, it may be more difficult for us to manage our business, our results of operations could be harmed, our ability to report results accurately and on time could be impaired, investors may lose faith in the reliability of our statements, and the price of our securities may be materially affected.Any failure to implement and maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional significant deficiencies or material weakness.  Any such failure could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding disclosure controls and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error and theft.  Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft. For example, in 2013, the Company has filed a claim with its insurance carrier for a theft of approximately $10 million of silver at its Albuquerque, New Mexico refinery. While we maintain controls to prevent employee theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are structured ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures and insurance.  We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility, and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. The destruction or closure of any of our manufacturing facilities or our mine for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Equipment failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our customers’ demands, which could harm our sales and cause our customers to find other suppliers. 10Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures, which may have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities.Many of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures, terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses that are not fully covered by our business interruption insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to meet our customers’ demands and reduce our sales.If the price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources increases, our operating expenses could increase significantly.We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel or other energy sources. Our operating expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices, including natural gas prices. Prices for electricity and natural gas may increase and can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase energy at historical market rates. While we have some long-term contracts with energy suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter into forward-fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and electricity for use in our operations, those contracts are of limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel or electricity needs. Additionally, price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as those increases which may occur from climate change legislation or other environmental mandates, may increase our cost of operations.Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could adversely impact our financial performance.Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to credit markets be reduced, customers may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, thereby impacting our sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered. The recent global economic crisis and the resulting recession have also caused higher unemployment rates, which could have an adverse impact on demand for consumer electronics, which comprised 30% of our sales in 2013. Any additional negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability and results of operations. For example, if the current economic conditions in Europe further deteriorate, it could trigger a global economic downturn similar to the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our sales to Europe, which accounted for approximately 14% of our sales in 2013.A lower interest rate environment coupled with less than expected investment performance may require us to increase our pension liability and expense, which may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and divert funds from other potential uses.We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate. Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly increase the deficit position of our plans. Should the pension asset return fall below our expectations, it is likely that future pension expenses would increase. The actual return on our plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2013 was a gain of approximately 15.4%.  For 2014, for pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 7.25% expected rate of return on pension assets.We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.  As of December 31, 2013, for pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 4.875% discount rate for our domestic defined benefit plan compared to 4.0% for the year ended December 31, 2012. Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates, including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate that we will make cash contributions of approximately $19.0 million to our pension plan in 2014. If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, contributions in 2014 and beyond may be greater than our current or future projections.We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.11Our expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.We provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we have used a graded assumption schedule to assume the rate at which health care costs will increase.  At December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, we assumed rates of 7.5% and 8.0%, respectively, for each of the following years.  We have assumed that this health care cost increase trend rate will decline in 0.5% increments to the ultimate trend rate of 5.0% by 2019.Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased the post-employment benefit obligation by $0.6 million at December 31, 2013.We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.Our financial results are likely to be negatively impacted by an impairment of goodwill should our shareholder equity exceed our market capitalization for a number of quarters.A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reduction in actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill balance at December 31, 2013 was $88.8 million. Any required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reduce this balance and have a material impact on our reported financial position and results of operations.A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging program to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K.We may be unable to access the financial markets on favorable terms.The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would increase our capital costs. In particular, the substantial volatility in world capital markets due to the global economic crisis has had a significant negative impact on the global financial markets.We rely on access to financial markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash on hand or operating cash flow. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including:•changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms;•a deterioration of our credit;•a deterioration in the financial condition of the banks with which we do business;•extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or credit requirements; and•the collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our flexibility in raising additional capital.These factors have adversely impacted our access to the financial markets from time to time. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions may make it difficult for us to access the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, to the extent necessary, on satisfactory terms or at all.Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. In the event of a global economic downturn, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an 12event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies and other strategic initiatives.We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We have been active over the last several years in pursuing niche acquisitions. For example, we completed the acquisition of Aerospace Metal Composites Ltd. in 2012 and EIS Optics Ltd. in 2011. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance.Although our Board of Directors currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock, the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the Board's assessment of our operations, financial condition, projected liabilities, our compliance with contractual restrictions in our credit agreement, restrictions imposed by applicable laws and other factors.  We cannot guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends at the same or similar rates.We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may negatively affect our financial performance.A significant portion of our sales is conducted in international markets and priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United States (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to 31% of sales in 2013, 31% in 2012 and 25% in 2011. Significant fluctuations in currency values relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our financial performance. In the past, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro and the yen, have impacted our sales, margins and profitability. The fair value of our net liability relating to outstanding foreign currency contracts was $0.1 million at December 31, 2013, indicating that the average hedge rates were favorable compared to the actual year-end market exchange rates. While we may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s complete exposure which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications and may contain undetected defects, errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs and other losses to our customers, end users or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.13Our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adequately address information security issues.We have taken measures to protect the integrity of our technology infrastructure and the privacy of confidential information. However, our technology infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, viruses or similar problems. If a person or entity circumvents our security measures, they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems, misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to make substantial additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches. Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability.We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. We have been and are continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia. Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 31% of our sales in 2013, 31% in 2012 and 25% in 2011. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to approximately 18% of our sales in 2013, 16% in 2012 and 14% in 2011. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and•fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, compliance costs and enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium and claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the conclusion of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.14We are presently uninsured for beryllium-related claims where the claimants’ first exposure to beryllium occurred on or after January 1, 2008, and we have not undertaken to estimate the impact of any such claims, which have yet to be asserted. In addition, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2013, we had two CBD cases outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.We, as well as our customers, are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are under review by OSHA, the Department of Energy and by other U.S. and foreign governmental and private standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards. Some organizations, such as the California Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of OSHA. The development, proposal or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.15Natural disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages, bankruptcies and other unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail production or shut down their operations.Our customers’ manufacturing operations are subject to conditions beyond their control, including raw material shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting the automotive industry, which is one of our major markets, and other unexpected events. For example, the tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011 caused wide-scale destruction of the Tohoku region and led most manufacturers in the area, most notably those in the automotive and consumer electronics markets, to slow or halt production. Similar events could also affect other suppliers to our customers. Such events could cause our customers to curtail production or to shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their demand for our products and reduce our sales.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death or injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly harm our operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may directly impact our facilities. For example, our Elmore, Ohio facility is located near, and derives power from, a nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist attack. In addition, terrorist attacks, related armed conflicts or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East or other regions of the world could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets, which could negatively impact our sales"
13,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2013-03-08,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted.Natural disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages, bankruptcies and other unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail production or shut down their operations.Our customers’ manufacturing operations are subject to conditions beyond their control, including raw material shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting the automotive industry, which is one of our major markets, and other unexpected events. For example, the tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011 caused wide-scale destruction of the Tohoku region and led most manufacturers in the area, most notably those in the automotive and consumer electronics markets, to slow or halt production. Similar events could also affect other suppliers to our customers. Such events could cause our customers to curtail production or to shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their demand for our products and reduce our sales.Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating our business.A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death and injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis.Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. See Item 2 of this Form 10-K. The destruction or closure of any of our manufacturing facilities or our mine for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our costs of doing business. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Equipment failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our customers’ demands, which could harm our sales and cause our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures, which may have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities.Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly harm our operations.Terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may directly impact our facilities. For example, our Elmore, Ohio facility is located near, and derives power from, a nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist attack. In addition, terrorist attacks, related armed conflicts or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East or other regions of the world could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on weapons and other systems incorporating our products 7may be reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets, which could negatively impact our sales.Many of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures, terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses that are not fully covered by our business interruption insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to meet our customers’ demands and reduce our sales.If the price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources increases, our operating expenses could increase significantly.We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel or other energy sources. See Item 2 of this Form 10-K. Our operating expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices, including natural gas prices. Prices for electricity and natural gas may increase and can fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase energy at historical market rates. While we have some long-term contracts with energy suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter into forward-fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and electricity for use in our operations, those contracts are of limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel or electricity needs. Additionally, price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as those increases which may occur from climate change legislation or other environmental mandates, may increase our cost of operations.The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw material costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of United States and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver, have increased significantly in recent years. These higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether as a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, to have a greater impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products has increased in tandem with the rising metal prices, as a result of changes in precious metal prices that are passed through to our customers, which could deter them from purchasing our products and adversely affect our sales.Further, we maintain some precious metals on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price of precious metals or the consignment fee could increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.We are dependent on our new primary beryllium facility for our future supply of pure beryllium.In 2008, we entered into an agreement with the Department of Defense to share in the cost of a new beryllium plant for primary beryllium feedstock. Installation and start-up of our new beryllium facility continued throughout 2012 at the Elmore, Ohio plant site.  The resulting additional operating and material costs and manufacturing inefficiencies reduced gross margin by an estimated $5.2 million in 2012 and an estimated $5.3 million in 2011. Construction is now complete, and we are ramping up production, but any delay in further transitioning the operation to run at required production levels could negatively impact our sales and/or cost structure as would unexpected quality problems in qualifying the new beryllium feedstock in our beryllium metal product lines.The availability of competitive substitute materials for beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers’ demand for these products and reduce our sales.In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum. Our customers may choose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products and the risk of litigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales.8The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology.We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industry standards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructure devices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions composed of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptance and respond to our competitors’ products.The process of developing new products can be technologically challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.Our products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment.Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applications and may contain undetected defects, errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service and warranty costs and other losses to our customers, end users or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales.Our lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold to customers.Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take up to two or three years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers’ product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements.Our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adequately address information security issues.We have taken measures to protect the integrity of our technology infrastructure and the privacy of confidential information. However, our technology infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, viruses or similar problems. If a person or entity circumvents our security measures, they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems, misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to make substantial additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches. Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability.A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended or canceled, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues.In 2012, 10% of our revenue was derived from sales to customers in the defense and science market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue.Additionally, the impact of sequestration is yet to be fully determined. Significant additional reductions to defense spending could occur over the next decade, which could have a significant adverse impact on us. While congressional leadership is considering a variety of options to avoid sequestration, it remains uncertain as to whether the government will actually do so. In the event the sequestration is implemented as currently mandated, there could be a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.9Disruptions or volatility in global financial markets could adversely impact our financial performance.Global economic conditions may cause volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. Should global economic conditions deteriorate or access to credit markets be reduced, customers may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate financing, thereby impacting our sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered. The recent global economic crisis and the resulting recession have also caused higher unemployment rates, which could have an adverse impact on demand for consumer electronics, which comprised 41% of our sales in 2012. Any additional negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability and results of operations. For example, if the current economic conditions in Europe further deteriorate, it could trigger a global economic downturn similar to the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our sales to Europe, which accounted for approximately 11% of our sales in 2012.The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability.A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer electronics, telecommunications infrastructure, defense and science, industrial components and commercial aerospace, automotive electronics and appliance industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business, including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics and computer industries and the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure equipment and government spending on defense.Also, in times when growth rates in our markets slow down, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business.Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by the fluctuations.We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas season generates increased demand from our customers that manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand and other occurrences in any of the other quarters could also harm our results of operations. For example, toward the end of 2010, customers were building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in the same period of 2011, demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. We have been and are continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia. Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 31% of our sales in 2012, 25% in 2011 and 28% in 2010. We anticipate that international shipments will account for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to approximately 16% of our sales in 2012, 14% in 2011 and 17% in 2010. There are a number of risks associated with international business activities, including:•burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;•difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States Government;•political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;•disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);•potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and•fluctuations in currency exchange rates.Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.10In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may negatively affect our financial performance.A significant portion of our sales is conducted in international markets and priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United States (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to 31% of sales in 2012, 25% in 2011 and 28% in 2010. A significant part of these international sales are priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Significant fluctuations in currency values relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our financial performance. In the past, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly for the euro and the yen, have impacted our sales, margins and profitability. The fair value of our net asset relating to outstanding foreign currency contracts was $0.3 million at December 31, 2012, indicating that the average hedge rates were favorable compared to the actual year-end market exchange rates. While we may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings, hedging activities may not be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Company’s complete exposure which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses.We have been active over the last several years in pursuing niche acquisitions. For example, we completed the acquisition of AMC in 2012 and EIS in 2011. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from any completed acquisition.In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses and consign additional precious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies and other strategic initiatives.Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. If the global economic downturn returns, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of default, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.11A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging program to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K.We may be unable to access the financial markets on favorable terms.The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would increase our capital costs. In particular, the substantial volatility in world capital markets due to the global economic crisis has had a significant negative impact on the global financial markets.We rely on access to financial markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash on hand or operating cash flow. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including:•changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms;•a deterioration of our credit;•a deterioration in the financial condition of the banks with which we do business;•extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or credit requirements; and•the collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our flexibility in raising additional capital.These factors have adversely impacted our access to the financial markets from time to time. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions may make it difficult for us to access the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, to the extent necessary, on satisfactory terms or at all.A lower interest rate environment coupled with less than expected investment performance may require us to increase our pension liability and expense, which may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and divert funds from other potential uses.We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense and our required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate. Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly increase the deficit position of our plans. Should the pension asset return fall below our expectations, it is likely that future pension expenses would increase. The actual return on our plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2012 was a gain of approximately 13%.  For 2013, for pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 7.50% expected rate of return on pension assets.We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.  As of December 31, 2012, for pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 4.00% discount rate for our domestic defined benefit plan compared to 4.75% for the year ended December 31, 2011. Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates, including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate that we will make cash contributions of approximately $13.0 million to our pension plan in 2013. If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, contributions in 2013 and beyond may be greater than our current or future projections.We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.12Our expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.We provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we maintained the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase for the next year at 8% for both December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. In addition, we have assumed that this health care cost increase trend rate will decline to 5% by 2019.Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased the post-employment benefit obligation by $0.8 million at December 31, 2012.We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.Utilizing precious metal in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.We manufacture precious, non-precious and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generated or customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.When taking periodic physical inventories in our refinery operations, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory. Those estimates are based on assays or samples of precious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). These fluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. For example, we reported a net inventory valuation loss of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter 2011 as a result of the reconciliation of the amount of metal on hand with amounts financed. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any inventory long or short.Because we maintain a significant inventory of precious metals, we may experience losses due to employee error and theft.  Because we manufacture products that contain precious metals, we maintain a significant amount of precious metals at certain of our manufacturing facilities.  Accordingly, we are subject to the risk of precious metal shortages resulting from employee error and theft. For example, in December 2012, the Company became aware of a potential theft of precious metal from its Albuquerque, New Mexico refinery. An investigation ensued, an arrest was made and a minor amount of stolen material was recovered.  The Company began further investigations, including an analysis of the fourth quarter physical inventory results, and engaged an outside team of forensic experts and criminal investigators. While the results of these investigations are not yet complete, preliminary indications are that some, or all, of this year-end inventory short may be due to theft.While we maintain controls to prevent employee theft, including physical security measures, if our controls do not operate effectively or are structured ineffectively, our profitability could be adversely affected, including any charges that we might incur as a result of the shortage of our inventory and by costs associated with increased security, preventative measures and insurance.  Our financial results are likely to be negatively impacted by an impairment of goodwill should our shareholder equity exceed our market capitalization for a number of quarters.A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reduction in actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill balance at December 31, 2012 was $88.8 million. Any required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reduce this balance and have a material impact on our reported financial position and results of operations.Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies.New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, compliance costs and enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder.13We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business.During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium and claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail at the conclusion of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.We are presently uninsured for beryllium-related claims where the claimants’ first exposure to beryllium occurred on or after January 1, 2008, and we have not undertaken to estimate the impact of such claims, which have yet to be asserted. In addition, some jurisdictions preclude insurance coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.Health issues, litigation and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate and adversely affect our profitability.If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic beryllium disease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing and coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee and third-party lawsuits.  As of December 31, 2012, we had one CBD case outstanding.The increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and international regulatory authorities could lead to regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers’ use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers’ businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products.Our customers and we are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are under review by OSHA, the Department of Energy and by other governmental and private standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards. Some organizations, such as the California Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of OSHA. The development, proposal or adoption of more stringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer use and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated.Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products.We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to our handling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA, impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment and the 14effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could impose on us significant additional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production"
8,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2012-02-29,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  Our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K, anyone of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks discussed below are not theonly risks that we may experience. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be negatively impacted.  Natural disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages, bankruptcies and other unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail production or shut down their operations. Our customers manufacturing operations are subject to conditions beyond their control, including raw materialshortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting the automotive industry, which is one of our majormarkets, and other unexpected events. For example, the tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011 caused wide-scale destruction of the Tohoku region and led most manufacturers in the area, most notably those in the automotive and consumer electronicsmarkets, to slow or halt production. Similar events could also affect other suppliers to our customers. Such events could cause our customers to curtail production or to shut down a portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their demandfor our products and reduce our sales.  Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost of operating ourbusiness.  A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed regardless of current operatinglevels. Our operating levels are subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall failures and ore processingchanges. Our mining operations also involve the handling and production of potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in death and injuries to employees and others and material property damage to third parties andus. Any explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could increase our cost of operations.  We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver ourproducts on a timely basis.  Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our manufacturingfacility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in production of most of its beryllium-containing materials. Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California and Tucson, Arizonamanufacturing facilities are dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. See Item 2 of this Form10-K. The destruction or closure of any of our manufacturing facilities or our mine for a significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism or other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt ourmanufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures and our costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or todelay production, which could increase our costs of doing business. Our property damage and business interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Equipment failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns. The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining operation, as well as in our manufacturingfacilities, depend on critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion, be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition to equipment  8 Table of Contentsfailures, our facilities are also subject to the risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or reductions in operations couldharm our ability to fulfill our customers demands, which could harm our sales and cause our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of any interruption in production capability may require us to make large capital expenditures,which may have a negative effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities. Future terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly harm our operations. Future terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may directly impact our facilities. For example, our Elmore,Ohio facility is located near, and derives power from, a nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist attack. In addition, future terrorist attacks, related armed conflicts or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East orother regions of the world could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scaledeployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also increasevolatility in the United States and worldwide financial markets, which could negatively impact our sales.  Many of our manufacturingfacilities are dependent on single source energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.  Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility for our miningoperations in Utah. A significant interruption in service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures, terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses that are not fully covered by our business interruption insurance. Anysubstantial unmitigated interruption of our operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to meet our customers demands and reduce our sales.  If the price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources increases, our operating expenses could increase significantly. We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel orother energy sources. See Item 2 of this Form 10-K. Our operating expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices, including natural gas prices. Prices for electricity and natural gas may increase and can fluctuatewidely with availability and demand levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase energy at historical market rates. While we have some long-term contracts with energysuppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter into forward-fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and electricity for use in our operations, those contracts are of limitedduration and do not cover all of our fuel or electricity needs. Price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as those increases which may occur from climate change legislation or other environmental mandates, may increase our cost ofoperations.  The availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in rawmaterial costs can adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition.  We manufactureadvanced engineered materials using various precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium, cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium, silver and tin. The availability of, and prices for, these raw materials aresubject to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of United Statesand foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors. Precious metal prices, including prices for gold and silver,   9 Table of Contentshave increased significantly in recent years. These higher prices can cause adjustments to our inventory carrying values, whether a result of quantity discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses,differences in scrap rates, theft or other factors, to have a greater impact on our profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products has increased in tandem with the rising metal prices, as a result of pass through, which could detercustomers from purchasing our products and adversely affect our sales.  Further, we maintain some preciousmetals on a consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market price of precious metals or the consignment feecould increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.  We are dependent on the successful scheduled start-up ofour new primary beryllium facility for our future supply of pure beryllium.  We have partnered with theDepartment of Defense to share in the cost of a new beryllium plant for primary beryllium feedstock. We may experience quality and/or production issues in the start-up of this new facility. Any prolonged delays of pure beryllium production from thenew plant could negatively impact our business.  The project is behind the original planned completion date.Construction is now complete, and we are successfully in low-rate initial production, but any delay in further transitioning the operation to run at required production levels could negatively impact our business as would unexpected quality problemsin qualifying the new beryllium feedstock in our beryllium metal product lines.  The availability of competitive substitute materialsfor beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers demand for these products and reduce our sales.  In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum. Our customers maychoose to use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these products and the risk oflitigation relating to beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce our sales. The markets for our products are experiencing rapid changes in technology. We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving customer specifications and industrystandards. New products may quickly render an existing product obsolete and unmarketable. For example, for many years thermal and mechanical performance have been at the forefront of device packaging for wireless communications infrastructuredevices. In recent years, a tremendous effort has been put into developing simpler packaging solutions composed of copper and other similar components. Our growth and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existingproducts and introduce newly developed products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve market acceptanceand respond to our competitors products.  The process of developing new products can be technologicallychallenging and requires the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail to develop new products that are appealing to our customers orfail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we may be unable to recover our research and development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and profitability.   10 Table of ContentsOur products are deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects that we find onlyafter deployment.  Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in complicated applicationsand may contain undetected defects, errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For example, we sell beryllium-copperalloy strip products in a coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. Consequently, our customers may discovererrors after the products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our resources, increased service andwarranty costs and other losses to our customers, end users or to us. Any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation, which could reduce our sales. Our lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be sold tocustomers.  Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the generation of a sales lead ornew product idea through the development of the product and the recording of sales, may typically take up to two or three years, making it very difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our inability to accurately predict the timing andmagnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced products, could affect our ability to meet our customers product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular periodthat do not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash flow requirements. Our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adequately address security issues. We have taken measures to protect the integrity of our technology infrastructure and the privacy of confidentialinformation. However, our technology infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to physical or electronic break-ins, viruses or similar problems. If a person or entity circumvents our security measures, they could jeopardize the security ofconfidential information stored on our systems, misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to make substantial additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy securitybreaches. Security breaches that result in access to confidential information could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability.  A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of defense-related products through various contracts and subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended or canceled, which could have an adverseimpact on our revenues.  In 2011, 11% of our revenue was derived from sales to customers in the defenseand science market. A portion of these customers operate under contracts with the U.S. Government, which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are not limited to,budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If cancellations were to occur, it would result in a reduction in our revenue.For example, various projects, including the F-22 fighter aircraft, have been canceled, which had, and will have, a negative impact on our revenue. In addition, any decreases in the defense budget that may be enacted could have an adverse impact onsome of our operations.  The global economic crisis that began in 2008 had, and any additional negative or uncertain worldwide economicconditions may have, a negative impact on our financial performance.  The global economic crisisadversely affected the global economy. Some customers experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the disruption in the credit markets, which has impacted our sales. Our   11 Table of Contentsexposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products previously ordered. This recession has also caused higher unemployment rates globally, which could havean adverse impact on demand for consumer electronics, which comprised 38% of our sales in 2011. Any additional negative or uncertain financial and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse impact on our sales, profitability and resultsof operations. For example, if the current economic crisis in Europe escalates, it could trigger a global economic downturn similar to the one experienced in 2008 and 2009. This could have a negative impact on our sales to Europe, which accountedfor approximately 10% of our sales in 2011.  The businesses of many of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a resultof the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our sales and profitability. A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer electronics, telecommunications infrastructure, defense andscience, industrial components and commercial aerospace, automotive electronics and appliance industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have a negative impact on our business,including, among other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics and computer industries and the rate of construction oftelecommunications infrastructure equipment and government spending on defense.  Also, in times when growthrates in our markets slow down, there may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may negatively affect our business. Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be affected by thefluctuations.  We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which may cause our quarterly results tofluctuate. For example, the Christmas season generates increased demand from our customers that manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, our share pricecould decline, perhaps significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of demand and other occurrences in any of the other quarters could also harm our results of operations. For example, toward the end of 2010, customerswere building inventory in anticipation of increased demand, whereas in the same period of 2011 demand decreased because our customers had excess inventory.  We conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States. We sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. We have been andare continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia. Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted for approximately 25% of our sales in 2011, 28% in 2010 and 35% in 2009. We anticipate that international shipments willaccount for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future. Revenue from international operations (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to approximately 14% of our sales in 2011, 17% in 2010 and 24% in 2009. There are a number ofrisks associated with international business activities, including:      burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements, tariffs and other barriers,environmental health and safety requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;      difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States Government;     political and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;     disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign CorruptPractices Act (FCPA);      potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and     fluctuations in currency exchange rates.   12 Table of ContentsAny of these risks could have an adverse effect on our internationaloperations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPAand similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance withthese anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Wecannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations, we could suffer from criminal or civilpenalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We are subject to fluctuations in currencyexchange rates, which may negatively affect our financial performance.  A significant portion of oursales is conducted in international markets and priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United States (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to 25% of sales in 2011, 28% in 2010 and 35% in 2009. Asignificant part of these international sales are priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Significant fluctuations in currency values relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our financial performance. In the past, fluctuations incurrency exchange rates, particularly for the euro and the yen, have impacted our sales, margins and profitability. The fair value of our net asset relating to outstanding foreign currency contracts was $1.4 million at December 31, 2011,indicating that the average hedge rates were favorable compared to the actual year-end market exchange rates. While we may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our earnings, hedging activities maynot be successful. For example, hedging activities may not cover the Companys complete exposure which could have an unfavorable impact on our results of operations.  We may not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully integrate acquired businesses. We have been active over the last several years in pursuing niche acquisitions. For example, during 2011 we completed theacquisition of EIS Optics Limited. We intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we will be successful inpursuing any acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending upon the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions,we may be required to raise additional financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms. Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected advantagesfrom any completed acquisition.  In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are unable, todiscover in the course of performing due diligence investigations on the assets or companies we have already acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or companies to us,even if obtained, will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, couldhave a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The terms of our indebtedness mayrestrict our operations, including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition strategies.  Theterms of our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to, among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other businesses and consign additional  13 Table of Contentsprecious metals. These covenants could adversely affect our business by limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affectour ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies and other strategic initiatives.  Our failure to comply with the covenantscontained in the terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition. The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with various covenants, including financial covenants. If theglobal economic downturn returns, it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to complywith these covenants depends, in part, on factors over which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in an event of default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived,could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness couldresult in cross defaults under our other debt instruments. Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event ofdefault, in which case we may be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.  A major portion of our bank debt consists ofvariable-rate obligations, which subjects us to interest rate fluctuations.  Our credit facilities aresecured by substantially all of our assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other assets). Our working capital line of credit includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate risks. If interest rates increase, ourdebt service obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging program to manage the risks associated with interest ratefluctuations, but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional information regarding our market risks is contained in Item 7A of this Form 10-K. We may be unable to access the financial markets on favorable terms. The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly during times of uncertainty in the financial markets,could impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would increase our capital costs. In particular, the substantial volatility in world capital markets due to the global economic crisis has had a significant negative impact on the globalfinancial markets.  We rely on access to financial markets as a significant source of liquidity for capitalrequirements not satisfied by cash on hand or operating cash flow. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely impacted by various factors, including:      changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the ability to renew existing credit facilities on acceptable terms;     a deterioration of our credit;      a deterioration in the financial condition of the banks with which we do business;     extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or credit requirements; and     the collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our flexibility in raisingadditional capital.  These factors have adversely impacted our access to the financialmarkets from time to time. Negative or uncertain global economic conditions may make it difficult for us to access the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, to the extent necessary, on satisfactory terms or atall.   14 Table of ContentsA lower interest rate environment coupled with less than expected investment performance may requireus to increase our pension liability and expense, which may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and divert funds from other potential uses. We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees. Our pension expense and our required contributions to ourpension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations,including the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present value, or the discount rate. As of January 1, 2012, for pension accounting purposes, we assumed a 7.75% rate of return on pension assets. Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantlyincrease the deficit position of our plans. Should the pension asset return fall below our expectations, it is likely that future pension expenses would increase. The actual return on our plan assets for the year ended December 31, 2011 was aloss of approximately 4%.  We establish the discount rate used to determine the present value of the projectedand accumulated benefit obligation at the end of each year based upon the available market rates for high quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a lower discountrate would raise the future pension expense.  Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates,including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate that we will be required to make a cash contribution of approximately $11.2 million to our pension plan in 2012. If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, a contributionin 2012 and beyond may be greater than our current or future projections.  We cannot predict whether changingmarket or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.  Our expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect. We also provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected bythe assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, wemaintained the assumed rate at which health care costs will increase for the next year at 8% for both December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. In addition, we have assumed that this health care cost increase trend rate will decline to 5%by 2019.  Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for thehealth care plans. A one percentage point increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have increased the post-employment benefit obligation by $0.8 million at December 31, 2011. We cannot predict whether changing market or economic conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will furtherincrease our retiree health care expenses or obligations, diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.  Utilizing preciousmetal in the manufacturing process creates challenges in physical inventory valuations that may impact earnings.  We manufacture precious, non-precious and specialty metal products and also have metal cleaning operations and in-house refineries that allow for the reclaim of precious metals from internally generatedor customer scrap. We refine that scrap through our internal operations and externally through outside vendors.   15 Table of ContentsWhen taking periodic physical inventories, we reconcile the actual precious metals to what was estimated prior to the physical inventory. Those estimates are based on assays or samples ofprecious metals taken during the refining process. If those estimates are inaccurate, we may have an inventory long (more physical precious metal than what we had estimated) or short (less physical precious metal than what we had estimated). Thesefluctuations could have a material impact on our financial statements and may impact earnings. For example, we reported a net inventory valuation loss of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter 2011 as a result of the reconciliation of the amount ofmetal on hand with amounts financed. Higher precious metal prices may magnify the value of any inventory long or short.  Our holdingcompany structure causes us to rely on funds from our subsidiaries.  We are a holding company andconduct substantially all our operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends and other payments to us by oursubsidiaries may be restricted by, among other things, applicable corporate and other laws and regulations, agreements of the subsidiaries and the terms of our current and future indebtedness. Our financial results are likely to be negatively impacted by an impairment of goodwill should our shareholder equity exceed our marketcapitalization for a number of quarters.  A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reductionin actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill balance at December 31, 2011 was $84.0 million. Any required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reducethis balance and have a material impact on our reported financial position and results of operations.  Changes in laws or regulations orthe manner of their interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or the manner of their interpretation or enforcement,could increase our cost of doing business and restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign operations, compliance costsand enforcement under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated thereunder. We are exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which could harm our business. During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become involved in certain legal proceedings, including thoseinvolving product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium and claims against us of infringement of intellectual property rights of third parties. Due to the uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance thatwe will prevail at the conclusion of future claims. Certain of these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, operating results or financial condition.  We are presently uninsured for beryllium-related claimswhere the claimants first exposure to beryllium occurred on or after January 1, 2008, and we have not undertaken to estimate the impact of such claims, which have yet to be asserted. In addition, some jurisdictions preclude insurancecoverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our profitability could be adversely affected if any current or future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or settlement ofa pending beryllium case or adverse media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation.   16 Table of ContentsHealth issues, litigation and government regulations relating to our beryllium operations couldsignificantly reduce demand for our products, limit our ability to operate and adversely affect our profitability.  If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic berylliumdisease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing andcoughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.  Further, some scientists claim there is evidenceof an association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens. The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been, and will continue to be, a significant issue confrontingthe beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability claims, employee and third-party lawsuits and increased levels of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and internationalregulatory authorities. This scrutiny includes regulatory decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating toberyllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand for our products. In addition, adverse media coveragerelating to our beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our profitability.  Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our customers businesses are subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and willcontinue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing products. Our customers and we are subject to laws regulating worker exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium areunder review by OSHA, the Department of Energy and by other governmental and private standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker safety standards. Some organizations, such as the CaliforniaOccupational Health and Safety Administration and the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted standards that are more stringent than the current standards of OSHA. The development, proposal or adoption of morestringent standards may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use of beryllium-containing products, ourresults of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to meet the newstandards, the extent of any reduction in customer use and other factors. The magnitude of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated. Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will continue toimpose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing products. We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating to the environment, including those relating to ourhandling of hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some environmental laws impose substantial penalties for non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or CERCLA,impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and licensingrequirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Future requirements could imposeon us significant   17 Table of Contentsadditional costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling and processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could be subjectto liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental laws and regulations couldalso require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in connection with our business, which would increase our costs of production.  "
10,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2011-03-09,">Item 1A.      RISK    FACTORS     Our business, financial condition, results of operations and    cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including,    but not limited to, those set forth below and elsewhere in this    Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    any one of which could cause our actual results to vary    materially from recent results or from our anticipated future    results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks,    including the risks described below. The risks discussed below    are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the    following risks occur, our business, results of operations or    financial condition could be negatively impacted.    6Table of ContentsThe businesses of many of our customers are subject to    significant fluctuations as a result of the cyclical nature of    their industries and their sensitivity to general economic    conditions, which could adversely affect the demand for our    products and reduce our sales and profitability.     A substantial number of our customers are in the consumer    electronics, telecommunications infrastructure, defense and    science, industrial components and commercial aerospace,    automotive electronics and appliance industries. Each of these    industries is cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of    factors that could have a negative impact on our business,    including, among other things, periods of economic growth or    recession, strength or weakness of the U.S. dollar, the    strength of the consumer electronics, automotive electronics and    computer industries and the rate of construction of    telecommunications infrastructure equipment and government    spending on defense.     Also, in times when growth rates in our markets slow down, there    may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may    negatively affect our business. The recent global economic crisis had, and any additional    negative or uncertain worldwide economic conditions may have, a    negative impact on our financial performance.     The recent global economic crisis adversely affected the global    economy. Some customers experienced difficulty in obtaining    adequate financing due to the disruption in the credit markets,    which has impacted our sales. Our exposure to bad debt losses    may also increase if customers are unable to pay for products    previously ordered. The severe recession has also caused higher    unemployment rates globally which could have an adverse effect    on demand for consumer electronics, which comprised 41% of our    sales in 2010. Any additional negative or uncertain financial    and macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse    effect on our sales, profitability and results of operations. We may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy or    successfully integrate acquired businesses.     We have been active over the last several years in pursuing    niche acquisitions. For example, during 2010 we completed the    acquisition of Materion Advanced Materials Technologies and    Services Corp. (formerly known as Academy Corporation). We    intend to continue to consider further growth opportunities    through the acquisition of assets or companies and routinely    review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict whether we    will be successful in pursuing any acquisition opportunities or    what the consequences of any acquisition would be. Future    acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds    and management time. Depending upon the nature, size and timing    of future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional    financing, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms.    Further, we may not be able to successfully integrate any    acquired business with our existing businesses or recognize any    expected advantages from any completed acquisition.     In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are    unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence    investigations on the assets or companies we have already    acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that    rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or    companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable,    collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully    offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or    property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the    aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations. The markets for our products are experiencing rapid    changes in technology.     We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing    technology and evolving customer specifications and industry    standards. New products may quickly render an existing product    obsolete and unmarketable. For example, copper beryllium has    long been used for high reliability contacts in mobile handheld    devices. Mobile device designers may justify using    lower-performance materials in some of the less-critical    components of mobile phones. Our growth and future results of    operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing    products and introduce newly developed products on a timely    basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry    standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the    marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve    market acceptance and respond to our competitors products.    7Table of Contents    The process of developing new products can be technologically    challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of    technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce    new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail    to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or    fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we    may be unable to recover our research and development costs,    which could adversely affect our margins and profitability. A portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of    defense-related products through various contracts and    subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended or canceled,    which could have an adverse impact on our revenue.     In 2010, 12% of our revenue was derived from sales to customers    in the defense and science market. A portion of these customers    operate under contracts with the U.S. government, which are    vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience or    default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but are    not limited to, budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of    government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal    or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If    these cancellations were to occur, it would result in a    reduction on our revenue. For example, various projects,    including the F-22 fighter aircraft, have been canceled, which    had, and will have, a negative impact on our revenue. Our products are deployed in complex applications and may    have errors or defects that we find only after    deployment.     Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in    complicated applications and may contain undetected defects,    errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested    during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be    fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For    example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil    form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its    specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer    stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected.    Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the    products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects,    errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product    returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion    of our resources, increased service and warranty costs and other    losses to our customers, end users or to us. Any of these    occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market    acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation,    which could reduce our sales. The terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations,    including our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition    strategies.     The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of    restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to,    among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other    businesses and consign additional precious metals. These    covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to    plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital    needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our    growth, acquisition strategies and other strategic initiatives. Our failure to comply with the covenants contained in the    terms of our indebtedness could result in an event of default,    which could materially and adversely affect our operating    results and our financial condition.     The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with    various covenants, including financial covenants. If the recent    global economic downturn returns, it could have a material    adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow, which could    adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial    covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to    comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over    which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants    could result in an event of default under one or more of the    agreements governing our indebtedness that, if not cured or    waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the    right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts    outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and    payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness    could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments.    Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay    borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some    or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of    default, in which case we may be required to seek legal    protection from our creditors.    8Table of ContentsWe conduct our sales and distribution operations on a    worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with    doing business outside the United States.     We sell to customers outside of the United States from our    United States and international operations. We have been and are    continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia.    Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted    for approximately 28% of our sales in 2010, 35% in 2009 and 37%    in 2008. We anticipate that international shipments will account    for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable    future. Revenue from international operations (principally    Europe and Asia) amounted to approximately 17% of our sales in    2010 and 24% in each of 2009 and 2008. There are a number of    risks associated with international business activities,    including:           burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting    foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements,    tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety    requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;           difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States    government;           political and economic instability and disruptions, including    terrorist attacks;           disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that    are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA);           potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or    differing tax structures; and           fluctuations in currency exchange rates.     Any of these risks could have an adverse effect on our    international operations by reducing the demand for our products    or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which    could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial    position, results of operations or cash flows.     In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the    FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and    similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally    prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper    payments to    non-U.S. officials    for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies    mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in    many parts of the world that have experienced governmental    corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict    compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local    customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal    controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless    or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are    found to be liable for FCPA violations, we could suffer from    criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have    a material adverse effect on our business. A major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate    obligations, which subjects us to interest rate    fluctuations.     Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our    assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other    assets). Our working capital line of credit includes    variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate    risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations    on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the    amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in    our net income. We have developed a hedging program to manage    the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, but our    program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial    exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional    information regarding our market risks is contained in    Part II, Item 7A of this    Form 10-K. The availability and prices of some raw materials we use    in our manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw    material costs can adversely affect our operating results and    our financial condition.     We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various    precious and non-precious metals, including aluminum, beryllium,    cobalt, copper, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, ruthenium,    silver and tin. The availability of and prices for these raw    materials are subject to volatility and are influenced by    worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world supply    and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of    substitute metals, the    9Table of Contents    U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of United    States and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived    shortages and other factors. Precious metal prices, including    prices for gold and silver, have increased significantly in    recent years. These higher prices can cause adjustments to our    inventory carrying values, whether a result of quantity    discrepancies, normal manufacturing losses, differences in scrap    rates, theft or other factors, to have a greater impact on our    profitability and cash flows. Also, the price of our products    has increased in tandem with the rising metal prices, as a    result of pass-through, which could deter customers from    purchasing our products and adversely affect our sales.     Further, we maintain some precious metals on a consigned    inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals charge a fee    that fluctuates based on the market price of those metals and    other factors. A significant increase in the market price of    precious metals or the consignment fee could increase our    financing costs, which could increase our operating costs. We are dependent on the successful scheduled completion of    a new primary beryllium facility for our future supply of pure    beryllium.     We have partnered with the Department of Defense to share in the    cost of a new beryllium plant for primary beryllium feedstock.    We may experience quality    and/or    production issues in    start-up of    this new facility. Any prolonged delays of pure beryllium    production from the new plant could negatively impact our    business. Because we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales,    our quarterly results will fluctuate, and our annual performance    will be affected by the fluctuations.     We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which causes our    quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas    season generates increased demand from our customers that    manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter    were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities    analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly.    Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of    demand and other occurrences in any of the other quarters could    also harm our results of operations. Natural disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages,    bankruptcies and other unexpected events may lead our customers    to curtail production or shut down their operations.     Our customers manufacturing operations are subject to    conditions beyond their control, including raw material    shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power    or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work    stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting    the automotive industry, one of our major markets, and other    unexpected events. For example, Delphi Corporation, a customer    of three of our business units and the largest United States    supplier of automotive parts, filed for bankruptcy protection in    2005. Delphi Corporation emerged from bankruptcy reorganization    in 2009. Similar events could also affect other suppliers to our    customers. Such events could cause our customers to curtail    production or to shut down a portion or all of their operations,    which could reduce their demand for our products and reduce our    sales. Unexpected events and natural disasters at our mine could    increase the cost of operating our business.     A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed    regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are    subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the    cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions    include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall    failures and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also    involve the handling and production of potentially explosive    materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in    death and injuries to employees and others and material property    damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to    adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially    adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could    increase our cost of operations. Equipment failures and other unexpected events at our    facilities may lead to manufacturing curtailments or    shutdowns.     The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining    operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on    critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion,    be out of service because of    10Table of Contents    unanticipated failure, and some equipment is not readily    available or replaceable. In addition to equipment failures, our    facilities are also subject to the risk of loss due to    unanticipated events such as fires, explosions or other    disasters. Material plant shutdowns or reductions in operations    could harm our ability to fulfill our customers demands,    which could harm our sales and cause our customers to find other    suppliers. Further, remediation of any interruption in    production capability may require us to make large capital    expenditures, which may have a negative effect on our    profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption    insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with    interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities. Many of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on    single source energy suppliers, and interruption in energy    services may cause manufacturing curtailments or    shutdowns.     Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for    electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is    the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility    for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in    service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures,    terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses    that are not fully covered by our business interruption    insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our    operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to    meet our customers demands and reduce our sales. If the price of electrical power, fuel or other energy    sources increases, our operating expenses could increase    significantly.     We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a    mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel or    other energy sources. See Item 2.     Properties, of this    Form 10-K.    Our operating expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity    prices and fuel prices, including natural gas prices. Prices for    electricity and natural gas have continued to increase and can    fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other    users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be    curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase energy at    historical market rates. While we have some long-term contracts    with energy suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy    costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter    into forward-fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and    electricity for use in our operations, those contracts are of    limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel or electricity    needs. Price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as    those increases which may occur from climate change legislation    or other environmental mandates, will continue to increase our    cost of operations. We have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and    damage to those facilities could interrupt our operations,    increase our costs of doing business and impair our ability to    deliver our products on a timely basis.     Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our    manufacturing facility, in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining    operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in    production of most of its beryllium-containing materials.    Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania; Fremont, California and    Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on    materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility    and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent    on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. See    Item 2  Properties, of this    Form 10-K.    The destruction or closure of any of our manufacturing    facilities or our mine for a significant period of time as a    result of fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism or other    natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our    manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures    and our costs of doing business and impair our ability to    deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may    need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to    delay production, which could increase our costs of doing    business. Our property damage and business interruption    insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes    it difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be    sold to customers.     Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the    generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the    development of the product and the recording of sales, may    typically take up to two or three years, making it very    difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our    inability to accurately predict the timing and    11Table of Contents    magnitude of sales of our products, especially newly introduced    products, could affect our ability to meet our customers    product delivery requirements or cause our results of operations    to suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do    not translate into sales during that period, or at all. In    addition, these failures would make it difficult to plan future    capital expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our    cash flow requirements. Future terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war    may directly harm our operations.     Future terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may    directly impact our facilities. For example, our Elmore, Ohio    facility is located near, and derives power from, a nuclear    power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist attack. In    addition, future terrorist attacks, related armed conflicts or    prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East or other    regions of the world could cause consumer confidence and    spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods that    contain our products. Further, when the United States armed    forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale    deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the    physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on    weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be    reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also    increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial    markets, which could negatively impact our sales. We may    be unable to access the financial markets on favorable    terms.     The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly    during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could    impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would    increase our capital costs. In particular, the substantial    volatility in world capital markets due to the recent global    economic crisis has had a significant negative impact on the    global financial markets.     We rely on access to financial markets as a significant source    of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash on    hand or operating cash flow. Our access to the financial markets    could be adversely impacted by various factors, including:           changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the    ability to renew existing liquidity facilities on acceptable    terms;           a deterioration of our credit;           a deterioration in the financial condition of the banks with    which we do business;           extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or    credit requirements; and           the collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in    connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our    flexibility in raising additional capital.     These factors have adversely impacted our access to the    financial markets from time to time. Negative or uncertain    global economic conditions may make it difficult for us to    access the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing,    as the case may be, to the extent necessary, on satisfactory    terms or at all. Low investment performance by our domestic pension plan    assets may require us to increase our pension liability and    expense, which may require us to fund a portion of our pension    obligations and divert funds from other potential uses.     We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.    Our pension expense and our required contributions to our    pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets,    the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of    return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to    measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including    the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present    value, or the discount rate. As of December 31, 2010, for    pension accounting purposes, we assumed an 8.00% rate of return    on pension assets.     Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets    resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly    increase the deficit position of our plans. Should the pension    asset return fall below our expectations, it    12Table of Contents    is likely that future pension expenses would increase. The    actual return on our plan assets for the year ended    December 31, 2010 was a gain of approximately 13.4%.     We establish the discount rate used to determine the present    value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the    end of each year based upon the available market rates for high    quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount    rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a    lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.     Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates,    including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate    that we will be required to make a cash contribution of    approximately $8.8 million to our pension plan in 2011. If    our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, a    contribution in years beyond 2011 may be greater than the    projected 2011 contribution required.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting    funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Our expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could    be materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying    assumptions prove to be incorrect.     We provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible    employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by    the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan    obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care    costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate    future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we    maintained the assumed rate at which health care costs will    increase for the next year at 8% for both December 31, 2010    and December 31, 2009. In addition, we have assumed that    this health care cost increase trend rate will decline to 5% by    2019.     Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one    percentage point increase in assumed health care cost trend    rates would have increased the post-employment benefit    obligation by $0.7 million at December 31, 2010.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations,    diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. We are subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates,    which may negatively affect our financial performance.     A significant portion of our sales is conducted in international    markets and priced in currencies other than the    U.S. dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United    States (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to 28% of sales in    2010, 35% in 2009 and 37% in 2008. A significant part of these    international sales are priced in currencies other than the    U.S. dollar. Significant fluctuations in currency values    relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our    financial performance. In the past, fluctuations in currency    exchange rates, particularly for the euro and the yen, have    impacted our sales, margins and profitability. The fair value of    our net liability relating to outstanding foreign currency    contracts was $1.5 million at December 31, 2010,    indicating that the average hedge rates were unfavorable    compared to the actual year end market exchange rates. While we    may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of    currency price volatility on our earnings, any hedging    activities may not be successful. Our    holding company structure causes us to rely on funds from our    subsidiaries.     We are a holding company and conduct substantially all our    operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we    are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of    funds from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends and other    payments to us by our subsidiaries may be restricted by, among    other things, applicable corporate and other laws and    regulations, agreements of the subsidiaries and the terms of our    current and future indebtedness.    13Table of ContentsOur financial results are likely to be negatively impacted    by an impairment of goodwill should our shareholder equity    exceed our market capitalization for a number of    quarters.     A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reduction in    actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively    impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill    balance at December 31, 2010 was $72.9 million. Any    required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reduce    this balance and have a material impact on our reported    financial position and results of operations. Changes in laws or regulations or the manner of their    interpretation or enforcement could adversely impact our    financial performance and restrict our ability to operate our    business or execute our strategies.     New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or    regulations or the manner of their interpretation or    enforcement, could increase our cost of doing business and    restrict our ability to operate our business or execute our    strategies. This includes, among other things, the possible    taxation under U.S. law of certain income from foreign    operations, compliance costs and enforcement under the    Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and    costs associated with complying with the Patient Protection and    Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the regulations promulgated    thereunder. We are    exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which    could harm our business.     During the ordinary conduct of our business, we may become    involved in certain legal proceedings, including those involving    product liability claims, third-party lawsuits relating to    exposure to beryllium and claims against us of infringement of    intellectual property rights of third parties. Due to the    uncertainties of litigation, we can give no assurance that we    will prevail at the conclusion of future claims. Certain of    these matters involve types of claims that, if they result in an    adverse ruling to us, could give rise to substantial liability    which could have a material adverse effect on our business,    operating results or financial condition.     We are presently uninsured for beryllium-related claims where    the claimants first exposure to beryllium occurred on or    after January 1, 2008, and we have not undertaken to    estimate the impact of such claims, which have yet to be    asserted. In addition, some jurisdictions preclude insurance    coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our    profitability could be adversely affected if any current or    future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory    or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or    settlement of a pending beryllium case or additional adverse    media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional    similar litigation. Health issues, litigation and government regulation    relating to our beryllium operations could significantly reduce    demand for our products, limit our ability to operate and    adversely affect our profitability.     If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some    individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium    and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic    beryllium disease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with    CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the    disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing    clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing and    coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.     Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an    association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and    certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium    and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.     The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been,    and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the    beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks    associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability    claims, employee and third-party lawsuits and increased levels    of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and international    regulatory authorities. This scrutiny includes regulatory    decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of    beryllium-containing materials for various uses. Concerns over    CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to    beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability    from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers    use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly    reduce demand for our products. In addition, continued or    increased adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-    14Table of Contents    containing products could damage our reputation or cause a    decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which    could adversely affect our profitability. Our bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related    manufacturing operations and some of our customers    businesses are subject to extensive health and safety    regulations that impose, and will continue to impose,    significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could    increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit    production or use of beryllium-containing products.     Our customers and we are subject to laws regulating worker    exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are    under review by OSHA, the Department of Energy and by other    governmental and private standard-setting organizations. One    result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker    safety standards. Some organizations, such as the California    Occupational Health and Safety Administration and the American    Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted    standards that are more stringent than the current standards of    OSHA. The development, proposal or adoption of more stringent    standards may affect buying decisions by the users of    beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more    stringent    and/or our    customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use    of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations,    liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely    affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would    depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards,    the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of    any reduction in customer use and other factors. The magnitude    of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated. Our bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations    are subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose,    and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities    on us, and future regulation could increase these costs and    liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing    products.     We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating    to the environment, including those relating to our handling of    hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some    environmental laws impose substantial penalties for    non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive    Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, or    CERCLA, impose strict, retroactive and joint and several    liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous    substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive    governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and    licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection,    reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge    of materials into the environment and the effects that mining    has on groundwater quality and availability. The Environmental    Protection Agency is developing financial responsibility    requirements under CERCLA for hardrock mining facilities. These    future requirements could impose on us significant additional    costs or obligations with respect to our extraction, milling and    processing of ore. If we fail to comply with present and future    environmental laws and regulations, we could be subject to    liabilities or our operations could be interrupted. In addition,    future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our    ability to expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore    deposits. These environmental laws and regulations could also    require us to acquire costly equipment, obtain additional    financial assurance, or incur other significant expenses in    connection with our business, which would increase our costs of    production. The availability of competitive substitute materials for    beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers    demand for these products and reduce our sales.     In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers    of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic    composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum.    Our customers may choose to use substitutes for    beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of    reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those    substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these    products and the risk of litigation relating to    beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes    for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand    for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could    reduce our sales. "
6,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2010-03-08,">Item 1A.      RISK    FACTORS     Our business, financial condition, results of operations and    cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including but    not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in this    Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    any one of which could cause our actual results to vary    materially from recent results or from our anticipated future    results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks,    including the risks described below. The risks discussed below    6Table of Contents    are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the    following risks occur, our business, results of operations or    financial condition could be negatively impacted. Health    issues, litigation and government regulation relating to our    beryllium operations could significantly reduce demand for our    products, limit our ability to operate and adversely affect our    profitability.     If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some    individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium    and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic    beryllium disease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with    CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the    disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing    clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing and    coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.     Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an    association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and    certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium    and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.     The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been,    and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the    beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks    associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability    claims, employee and third-party lawsuits and increased levels    of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and international    regulatory authorities. This scrutiny includes regulatory    decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of    beryllium-containing material for various uses. Concerns over    CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to    beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability    from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers    use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly    reduce demand for our products. In addition, continued or    increased adverse media coverage relating to our beryllium-    containing products could damage our reputation or cause a    decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products, which    could adversely affect our profitability. Our    bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing    operations and some of our customers businesses are    subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose,    and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities,    and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities    or effectively prohibit production or use of    beryllium-containing products.     Our customers and we are subject to laws regulating worker    exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are    under review by OSHA and by other governmental and private    standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will    likely be more stringent worker safety standards. Some    organizations, such as the California Occupational Health and    Safety Administration and the American Conference of    Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted standards that    are more stringent than the current standards of OSHA. The    development, proposal or adoption of more stringent standards    may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing    products. If the standards are made more stringent    and/or our    customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use    of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations,    liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely    affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would    depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards,    the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of    any reduction in customer use and other factors. The magnitude    of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated. Our    bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject    to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will    continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and    future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or    prevent production of beryllium-containing    products.     We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating    to the environment, including those relating to our handling of    hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some    environmental laws impose substantial penalties for    non-compliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive    Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose    strict, retroactive and joint and several liability upon    entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances.    Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental    regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing    requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and    restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials    into the environment and the effects that mining has on    groundwater quality and availability. If we fail to comply with    present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could    be subject to liabilities or our operations    7Table of Contents    could be interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and    regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities    or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental    laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly    equipment, obtain additional financial assurance, or incur other    significant expenses in connection with our business, which    would increase our costs of production. The    availability of competitive substitute materials for    beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers    demand for these products and reduce our sales.     In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers    of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic    composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum.    Our customers may choose to use substitutes for    beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of    reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those    substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these    products and the risk of litigation relating to    beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes    for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand    for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could    reduce our sales. The    markets for our beryllium-containing and    non-beryllium-containing products are experiencing rapid changes    in technology.     We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing    technology and evolving customer specifications and industry    standards. New products may quickly render an existing product    obsolete and unmarketable. For example, copper beryllium has    long been used for high reliability contacts in mobile handheld    devices. Mobile device designers may justify using    lower-performance materials in some of the less-critical    components of mobile phones. Our growth and future results of    operations depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing    products and introduce newly developed products on a timely    basis that conform to prevailing and evolving industry    standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the    marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve    market acceptance and respond to our competitors products.     The process of developing new products can be technologically    challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of    technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce    new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail    to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or    fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we    may be unable to recover our significant research and    development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and    profitability. We are    dependent on the successful scheduled completion of a new    primary beryllium facility for our future supply of pure    beryllium.     We have partnered with the Department of Defense to share in the    cost of a new beryllium plant for primary beryllium feedstock.    We may experience construction delays and quality    and/or    production issues in    start-up of    this new facility. Any prolonged delays of pure beryllium    production from the new plant could negatively impact our    Company. We are    exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which    could harm our business.     We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings,    including those involving product liability claims, and    third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium as well    as claims against us of infringement of intellectual property    rights of third parties and other claims arising out of the    ordinary conduct of our business. Due to the uncertainties of    litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on    claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or    that additional claims will not be made against us in the    future. Certain of these matters involve types of claims, that,    if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to    substantial liability which could have a material adverse effect    on our business, operating results or financial condition.     We are presently uninsured for beryllium-related claims where    the claimants first exposure to beryllium occurred on or    after January 1, 2008, and we have not undertaken to    estimate the impact of such claims, which have yet to be    asserted. In addition, some jurisdictions preclude insurance    coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our    profitability could be adversely affected if any current or    future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory    or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or    settlement of a pending    8Table of Contents    beryllium case or additional adverse media coverage could    encourage the commencement of additional similar litigation. A    portion of our revenue is derived from the sale of    defense-related products through various contracts and    subcontracts. These contracts may be suspended or canceled,    which could have an adverse impact on the Companys    revenues.     In 2009, 8% of our revenue was derived from sales to customers    in the aerospace and defense market. A portion of these    customers operate under contracts with the U.S. government,    which are vulnerable to termination at any time, for convenience    or default. Some of the reasons for cancellation include, but    are not limited to: budgetary constraints or re-appropriation of    government funds, timing of contract awards, violations of legal    or regulatory requirements, and changes in political agenda. If    these cancellations were to occur, it would result in a    reduction to Company revenues. For example, various projects    including the F-22 fighter aircraft have been canceled, which    had and will have a negative impact on our sales. Our    beryllium-containing and non-beryllium-containing products are    deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects    that we find only after deployment.     Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in    complicated applications and may contain undetected defects,    errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested    during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be    fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For    example, we sell beryllium- copper alloy strip products in a    coil form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its    specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer    stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected.    Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the    products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects,    errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product    returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion    of our resources, increased service and warranty costs and other    losses to our customers, end users or to us. Any of these    occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market    acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation,    which could reduce our sales. Many    of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a    result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their    sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could    adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our    sales and profitability.     A substantial number of our customers are in the    telecommunications and computer, aerospace and defense,    industrial components, data storage, automotive electronics and    appliance industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in    nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have    a negative impact on our business, including, among other    things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or    weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer    electronics, automotive electronics and computer industries and    the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure    equipment and government spending on defense.     Also, in times when growth rates in our markets slow down, there    may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may    negatively affect our business. The    global economic crisis is having a negative impact on our    financial performance.     The global economic crisis continues to adversely affect the    global economy. Some customers are experiencing difficulty in    obtaining adequate financing due to the current disruption in    the credit markets, which has impacted our sales. Our exposure    to bad debt losses may also increase if customers are unable to    pay for products previously ordered. The severe recession has    also caused higher unemployment rates globally which could have    an adverse affect on demand for consumer electronics, which    comprised over 55% of our sales in 2009. Continuation or further    deterioration of these financial and macroeconomic conditions    may have a significant adverse effect on our sales,    profitability and results of operations.    9Table of ContentsWe may    not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully    integrate acquired businesses.     We have been active over the last several years in pursuing    niche acquisitions for one of our subsidiaries, Williams    Advanced Materials Inc. We intend to continue to consider    further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets    or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We    cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any    acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any    acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the    expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending    upon the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may    be required to raise additional financing, which may not be    available to us on acceptable terms. Further, we may not be able    to successfully integrate any acquired business with our    existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from    any completed acquisition.     In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are    unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence    investigations on the assets or companies we have already    acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that    rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or    companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable,    collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully    offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or    property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the    aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations. The    terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including    our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition    strategies.     The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of    restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to,    among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other    businesses and consign additional precious metals. These    covenants could adversely affect us by limiting our ability to    plan for or react to market conditions or to meet our capital    needs, as well as adversely affect our ability to pursue our    growth, acquisition strategies and other strategic initiatives. Our    failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of    our indebtedness could result in an event of default which could    materially and adversely affect our operating results and our    financial condition.     The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with    various covenants, including financial covenants. If the global    economic crisis is prolonged, it could have a material adverse    impact on our earnings and cash flow which could adversely    affect our ability to comply with our financial covenants and    could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to comply with    these covenants depends, in part, on factors over which we may    have no control. A breach of any of these covenants could result    in an event of default under one or more of the agreements    governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or waived, could    give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the right to    terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts outstanding    with respect to the indebtedness to be due and payable    immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness could    result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments. Our    assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay    borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some    or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of    default, in which case we may be required to seek legal    protection from our creditors. We    conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide    basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing    business outside the United States.     We sell to customers outside of the United States from our    United States and international operations. We have been and are    continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia.    Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted    for approximately 35% of our sales in 2009, 37% in 2008 and 43%    in 2007. We anticipate that international shipments will account    for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable    future. Revenue from international operations (principally    Europe and Asia) amounted to approximately 24% of our sales in    2009 and 2008 and 25% in 2007. There are a number of risks    associated with international business activities, including:           burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting    foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements,    tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety    requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;           difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States    government;    10Table of Contents           political and economic instability and disruptions, including    terrorist attacks;           potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or    differing tax structures; and           fluctuations in currency exchange rates.     Additionally, foreign and international regulations have also    impacted our sales, margins and profitability in the past. See    also  Health issues, litigation and government    regulation relating to machining and manufacturing of    beryllium-containing products could significantly reduce demand    for our products, limit our ability to operate and adversely    affect our profitability, and  Our    bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing    operations and some of our customers businesses are    subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose,    and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities,    and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities    or effectively prohibit production or use of    beryllium-containing products. Further, any of these risks    could continue in the future. A    major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate    obligations, which subjects us to interest rate    fluctuations.     Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our    assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other    assets). Our working capital    line-of-credit    includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest    rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service    obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase    even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a    decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging program    to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations,    but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the    financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations.    Additional information regarding our market risks is contained    in Part II, Item 7A of this    Form 10-K. The    availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our    manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw    material costs can increase our operating costs.     We manufacture advanced engineered materials using various    precious and non-precious metals, including gold, silver,    palladium, platinum, ruthenium, copper and nickel. The    availability of and prices for these raw materials are subject    to volatility and are influenced by worldwide economic    conditions, speculative action, world supply and demand    balances, inventory levels, availability of substitute metals,    the U.S. dollar exchange rate, production costs of United    States and foreign competitors, anticipated or perceived    shortages and other factors. Decreased availability and    fluctuating prices of precious and non-precious metals that we    use in our manufacturing can increase our operating costs. For    example, prices for copper have been very volatile in recent    months due to global demand and market conditions. Further, we    maintain some precious metals on a consigned inventory basis.    The owners of the precious metals charge a fee that fluctuates    based on the market price of those metals and other factors. A    significant increase in the market price of precious metals or    the consignment fee could increase our financing costs, which    could increase our operating costs. Because    we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly    results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be    affected by the fluctuations.     We expect seasonal patterns to continue, which causes our    quarterly results to fluctuate. For example, the Christmas    season generates increased demand from our customers that    manufacture consumer products. If our revenue during any quarter    were to fall below the expectations of investors or securities    analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps significantly.    Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than normal levels of    demand and other occurrences in any of the other quarters could    also harm our results of operations. Natural    disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages, bankruptcies and    other unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail    production or shut down their operations.     Our customers manufacturing operations are subject to    conditions beyond their control, including raw material    shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power    or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work    stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting    the automotive industry, one of    11Table of Contents    our major markets, and other unexpected events. For example,    Delphi Corporation, a customer of three of our business units    and the largest United States supplier of automotive parts,    filed for bankruptcy protection in 2005. Delphi Corporation    emerged from bankruptcy reorganization in 2009. Similar events    could also affect other suppliers to our customers. In either    case, such events could cause our customers to curtail    production or to shut down a portion or all of their operations,    which could reduce their demand for our products and reduce our    sales. Unexpected    events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost    of operating our business.     A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed    regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are    subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the    cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions    include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall    failures and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also    involve the handling and production of potentially explosive    materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in    death and injuries to employees and others and material property    damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to    adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially    adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could    increase our cost of operations. Equipment    failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead    to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining    operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on    critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion,    be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some    equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition    to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the    risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires,    explosions or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or    reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our    customers demands, which could harm our sales and cause    our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of    any interruption in production capability may require us to make    large capital expenditures, which may have a negative effect on    our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption    insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with    interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities. Many    of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source    energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause    manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for    electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is    the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility    for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in    service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures,    terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses    that are not fully covered by our business interruption    insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our    operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to    meet our customers demands and reduce our sales. If the    price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources    increases, our operating expenses could increase    significantly.     We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a    mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel or    other energy sources. See Item 2.     Properties, of this Form    10-K. Our    operating expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity    prices and fuel prices, including natural gas prices. Prices for    electricity and natural gas have continued to increase and can    fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other    users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be    curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase energy at    historical market rates. While we have some long-term contracts    with energy suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy    costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter    into forward-fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and    electricity for use in our operations, those contracts are of    limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel or electricity    needs. Price increases in fuel and electricity costs, such as    those increases which may occur from climate change legislation    or other environmental mandates, will continue to increase our    cost of operations.    12Table of ContentsWe    have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to    those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our    costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our    products on a timely basis.     Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our    manufacturing facility, in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining    operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in    production of most of its beryllium-containing materials.    Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania, Fremont, California and    Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on    materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility    and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent    on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. See    Item 2  Properties, of this    Form 10-K.    The destruction or closure of any of our manufacturing    facilities or our mine for a significant period of time as a    result of fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism or other    natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our    manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures    and our costs of doing business and impair our ability to    deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may    need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to    delay production, which could increase our costs of doing    business. Our property damage and business interruption    insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our    lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it    difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be    sold to customers.     Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the    generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the    development of the product and the recording of sales, may    typically take up to two or three years, making it very    difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our    inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of    sales of our products, especially newly introduced products,    could affect our ability to meet our customers product    delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to    suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not    translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition,    these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital    expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash    flow requirements. Future    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly    harm our operations.     Future terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may    directly impact our facilities. For example, our Elmore, Ohio    facility is located near and derives power from a nuclear power    plant, which could be a target for a terrorist attack. In    addition, future terrorist attacks, related armed conflicts or    prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East or other    regions of the world could cause consumer confidence and    spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods that    contain our products. Further, when the United States armed    forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale    deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the    physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on    weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be    reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also    increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial    markets, which could negatively impact our sales. We may    be unable to access the financial markets on favorable    terms.     The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly    during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could    impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would    increase our capital costs. In particular, the substantial    volatility in world capital markets due to the global economic    crisis has had a significant negative impact on the global    financial markets.     We rely on access to financial markets as a significant source    of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash on    hand or operating cash flow. Our access to the financial markets    could be adversely impacted by various factors, including:           changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the    ability to renew existing liquidity facilities on acceptable    terms;           a deterioration of our credit;           a deterioration in the financial condition of the banks in which    we do business;    13Table of Contents           extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or    credit requirements; and           the collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in    connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our    flexibility in raising additional capital.     All of these factors have adversely impacted our access to the    financial markets at various times over the last five years. The    global economic crisis may make it difficult for us to access    the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the    case may be, to the extent necessary, on satisfactory terms or    at all. Low    investment performance by our domestic pension plan assets may    require us to increase our pension liability and expense, which    may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and    divert funds from other potential uses.     We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.    Our pension expense and our required contributions to our    pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets,    the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of    return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to    measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including    the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present    value, or the discount rate. As of December 31, 2009, for    pension accounting purposes, we assumed an 8.25% rate of return    on pension assets.     Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets    resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly    increase the deficit position of our plans. Should the pension    asset return fall below our expectations, it is likely that    future pension expenses would increase. The actual return on our    plan assets for the twelve months ending December 31, 2009    was a gain of approximately 16%.     We establish the discount rate used to determine the present    value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the    end of each year based upon the available market rates for high    quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount    rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a    lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.     Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates,    including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate    that we will be required to make a cash contribution of    approximately $8 million to our pension plan in 2010. If    our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, a    contribution in years beyond 2010 may be greater than the    projected 2010 contribution required.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting    funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Our    expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could be    materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying    assumptions prove to be incorrect.     We also provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible    employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by    the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan    obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care    costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate    future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we    maintained the assumed rate at which health care costs will    increase for the next year at 8% for both December 31, 2009    and December 31, 2008. In addition, we have assumed that    this health care cost increase trend rate will decline to 5% by    2016. We have used the same discount rates for our retiree    health plans that we use for our pension plan accounting.     Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one    percentage point increase in assumed health care cost trend    rates would have increased the post-employment benefits included    among the liabilities in our balance sheet by $0.6 million    at December 31, 2009.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations,    diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses.    14Table of ContentsWe are    subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may    negatively affect our financial performance.     A significant portion of our sales is conducted in international    markets and priced in currencies other than the    U.S. dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United    States (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to 35% of sales in    2009, 37% in 2008 and 43% in 2007. A significant part of these    international sales are priced in currencies other than the    U.S. dollar. Significant fluctuations in currency values    relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our    financial performance. In the past, fluctuations in currency    exchange rates, particularly for the euro and the yen, have    impacted our sales, margins and profitability. The fair value of    our net asset relating to outstanding foreign currency contracts    was $0.1 million at December 31, 2009, indicating that    the average hedge rates were slightly favorable compared to the    actual year-end market exchange rates. While we may hedge our    currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price    volatility on our earnings, any hedging activities may not be    successful. Our    holding company structure causes us to rely on funds from our    subsidiaries.     We are a holding company and conduct substantially all our    operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we    are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of    funds from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends and other    payments to us by our subsidiaries may be restricted by, among    other things, applicable corporate and other laws and    regulations, agreements of the subsidiaries and the terms of our    current and future indebtedness. Our    financial results are likely to be negatively impacted by an    impairment of goodwill should our shareholder equity exceed our    market capitalization for a number of quarters.     A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reduction in    actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively    impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill    balance at December 31, 2009 was $67.0 million. Any    required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reduce    this balance and have a material impact on our reported    financial position and results of operations. "
17,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2009-02-27,">Item 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     Our business, financial condition, results of operations and    cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including but    not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in this    Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    any one of which could cause our actual results to vary    materially from recent results or from our anticipated future    results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks,    including the risks described below. The risks discussed below    are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the    following risks occur, our business, results of operations or    financial condition could be negatively impacted. Health    issues, litigation and government regulation relating to    machining and manufacturing of beryllium-containing products    could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our    ability to operate and adversely affect our    profitability.     If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some    individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium    and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic    beryllium disease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with    CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the    disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing    clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing and    coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.     Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an    association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and    certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium    and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.    6Table of Contents    The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been,    and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the    beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks    associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability    claims, employee and third-party lawsuits and increased levels    of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and international    regulatory authorities. This scrutiny includes regulatory    decisions relating to the approval or prohibition of the use of    beryllium-containing material for various uses. Concerns over    CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to    beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability    from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers    use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly    reduce demand for our products. In addition, continued or    increased adverse media coverage relating to our    beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or    cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products,    which could adversely affect our profitability. Our    bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing    operations and some of our customers businesses are    subject to extensive health and safety regulations that impose,    and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities,    and future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities    or effectively prohibit production or use of    beryllium-containing products.     Our customers and we are subject to laws regulating worker    exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are    under review by OSHA and by other governmental and private    standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will    likely be more stringent worker safety standards. Some    organizations, such as the California Occupational Health and    Safety Administration and the American Conference of    Governmental Industrial Hygienists, have adopted standards that    are more stringent than the current standards of OSHA. The    development, proposal or adoption of more stringent standards    may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing    products. If the standards are made more stringent    and/or our    customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use    of beryllium-containing products, our results of operations,    liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely    affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would    depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards,    the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of    any reduction in customer use and other factors. The magnitude    of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated. Our    bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject    to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will    continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and    future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or    prevent production of beryllium-containing    products.     We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating    to the environment, including those relating to our handling of    hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some    environmental laws impose substantial penalties for    noncompliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive    Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose    strict, retroactive and joint and several liability upon    entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances.    Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental    regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing    requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and    restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials    into the environment and the effects that mining has on    groundwater quality and availability. If we fail to comply with    present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could    be subject to liabilities or our operations could be    interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and    regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities    or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. These environmental    laws and regulations could also require us to acquire costly    equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection    with our business, which would increase our costs of production. The    availability of competitive substitute materials for    beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers    demand for these products and reduce our sales.     In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers    of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic    composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum.    Our customers may choose to use substitutes for    beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of    reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those    substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these    products and the risk of litigation relating to    beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes    for beryllium-    7Table of Contents    containing products in their products, the demand for our    beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could reduce    our sales. The    markets for our beryllium-containing and    non-beryllium-containing products are experiencing rapid changes    in technology.     We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing    technology and evolving customer specifications and industry    standards. New products may quickly render an existing product    obsolete and unmarketable. For example, at one time we produced    beryllium-copper alloys that were used in the production of some    golf club heads, but these beryllium-copper alloy club heads are    no longer produced by any of our customers. Our growth and    future results of operations depend in part upon our ability to    enhance existing products and introduce newly developed products    on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and evolving    industry standards, meet or exceed technological advances in the    marketplace, meet changing customer specifications, achieve    market acceptance and respond to our competitors products.     The process of developing new products can be technologically    challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of    technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce    new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail    to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or    fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we    may be unable to recover our significant research and    development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and    profitability. We are    dependent on the successful scheduled completion of a new    primary beryllium facility for our future supply of pure    beryllium.     We have partnered with the Department of Defense to share in the    cost of a new beryllium pebble plant for primary beryllium    feedstocks. We may experience government funding delays or    cancellations, construction delays and quality    and/or    production issues in start up of this new facility. Any    prolonged delays of pure beryllium production from the new    pebble plant could negatively impact the Beryllium and Beryllium    Composites segment. We are    exposed to lawsuits in the normal course of business, which    could harm our business.     We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings,    including those involving product liability claims, and employee    and third-party lawsuits relating to exposure to beryllium as    well as claims against us of infringement of intellectual    property rights of third parties and other claims arising out of    the ordinary conduct of our business. Due to the uncertainties    of litigation, we can give no assurance that we will prevail on    claims made against us in the lawsuits that we currently face or    that additional claims will not be made against us in the    future. Certain of these matters involve types of claims, that,    if they result in an adverse ruling to us, could give rise to    substantial liability which could have a material adverse effect    on our business, operating results or financial condition.     We are presently uninsured for beryllium-related claims where    the claimants first exposure to beryllium occurred on or    after January 1, 2008, and we have not undertaken to    estimate the impact of such claims, which have yet to be    asserted. In addition, some jurisdictions preclude insurance    coverage for punitive damage awards. Accordingly, our    profitability could be adversely affected if any current or    future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory    or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or    settlement of a pending beryllium case or additional adverse    media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional    similar litigation. Our    beryllium-containing and non-beryllium-containing products are    deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects    that we find only after deployment.     Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in    complicated applications and may contain undetected defects,    errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested    during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be    fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For    example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil    form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its    specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer    stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. In    addition, we have experienced, on one occasion, a quality issue    during the manufacturing ramp up of a new product. Consequently,    8Table of Contents    our customers may discover errors after the products have been    deployed. The occurrence of any defects, errors, or failures    could result in installation delays, product returns,    termination of contracts with our customers, diversion of our    resources, increased service and warranty costs and other losses    to our customers, end users or to us. Any of these occurrences    could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance    of our products and could damage our reputation, which could    reduce our sales. Many    of our customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a    result of the cyclical nature of their industries and their    sensitivity to general economic conditions, which could    adversely affect their demand for our products and reduce our    sales and profitability.     A substantial number of our customers are in the    telecommunications and computer, data storage, aerospace and    defense, automotive electronics, industrial components and    appliance industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in    nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have    a negative impact on our business, including, among other    things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or    weakness of the U.S. dollar, the strength of the consumer    electronics, automotive electronics and computer industries and    the rate of construction of telecommunications infrastructure    equipment and government spending on defense.     Also, in times when growth rates in our markets slow down, there    may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may    negatively affect our business. The    current global economic crisis is having a negative impact on    our financial performance.     The global economic crisis continues to adversely affect the    domestic and global economies. Some customers are experiencing    difficulty in obtaining adequate financing due to the current    disruption in the credit markets, which has impacted our sales.    Our exposure to bad debt losses may also increase if customers    are unable to pay for products previously ordered. The severe    recession has also caused higher unemployment rates globally    which could have an adverse affect on demand for consumer    electronics, which comprised over 50% of our sales in 2008.    Continuation or further deterioration of these financial and    macroeconomic conditions may have a significant adverse effect    on our sales, profitability and results of operations. We may    not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully    integrate acquired businesses.     We have been active over the last several years in pursuing    niche acquisitions for one of our subsidiaries, Williams    Advanced Materials Inc. We intend to continue to consider    further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets    or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We    cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any    acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any    acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the    expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending    upon the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may    be required to raise additional financing, which may not be    available to us on acceptable terms. Further, we may not be able    to successfully integrate any acquired business with our    existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from    any completed acquisition.     In addition, there may be liabilities that we fail, or are    unable, to discover in the course of performing due diligence    investigations on the assets or companies we have already    acquired or may acquire in the future. We cannot assure that    rights to indemnification by the sellers of these assets or    companies to us, even if obtained, will be enforceable,    collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully    offset the possible liabilities associated with the business or    property acquired. Any such liabilities, individually or in the    aggregate, could have a materially adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations. The    terms of our indebtedness may restrict our operations, including    our ability to pursue our growth and acquisition    strategies.     The terms of our credit facilities contain a number of    restrictive covenants, including restrictions in our ability to,    among other things, borrow and make investments and acquire    other businesses. These covenants could adversely affect us by    limiting our ability to plan for or react to market conditions    or to meet our capital needs, as well as adversely affect our    ability to pursue our growth, acquisition strategies and other    strategic initiatives.    9Table of ContentsOur    failure to comply with the covenants contained in the terms of    our indebtedness could result in an event of default which could    materially and adversely affect our operating results and our    financial condition.     The terms of our credit facilities require us to comply with    various covenants, including financial covenants. If the current    global economic crisis is prolonged, it could have a material    adverse impact on our earnings and cash flow which could    adversely affect our ability to comply with our financial    covenants and could limit our borrowing capacity. Our ability to    comply with these covenants depends, in part, on factors over    which we may have no control. A breach of any of these covenants    could result in an event of default under one or more of the    agreements governing our indebtedness which, if not cured or    waived, could give the holders of the defaulted indebtedness the    right to terminate commitments to lend and cause all amounts    outstanding with respect to the indebtedness to be due and    payable immediately. Acceleration of any of our indebtedness    could result in cross defaults under our other debt instruments.    Our assets and cash flow may be insufficient to fully repay    borrowings under all of our outstanding debt instruments if some    or all of these instruments are accelerated upon an event of    default, in which case we may be required to seek legal    protection from our creditors. We    conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide    basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing    business outside the United States.     We sell to customers outside of the United States from our    United States and international operations. We have been and are    continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia.    Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted    for approximately 35% of our sales in 2008, 43% in 2007, and 35%    in 2006. We anticipate that international shipments will account    for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable    future. Revenue from    non-United    States operations (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to    approximately 24% of our sales in 2008, 25% in 2007, and 23% in    2006. There are a number of risks associated with international    business activities, including:           burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting    foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements,    tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety    requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;           difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States    government;           political and economic instability and disruptions, including    terrorist attacks;           potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or    differing tax structures; and           fluctuations in currency exchange rates.     Additionally, foreign and international regulations have also    impacted our sales, margins and profitability in the past. See    also  Health issues, litigation and government    regulation relating to machining and manufacturing of    beryllium-containing products could significantly reduce demand    for our products, limit our ability to operate and adversely    affect our profitability, found on page 6 of this    Form 10-K    and  Our bertrandite ore mining and    beryllium-related manufacturing operations and some of our    customers businesses are subject to extensive health and    safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose,    significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could    increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit    production or use of beryllium-containing products, found    on page 7 on this    Form 10-K.    Further, any of these risks could continue in the future. A    major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate    obligations, which subjects us to interest rate    fluctuations.     Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our    assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other    assets). Our working capital line-of-credit includes    variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest rate    risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations    on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase even if the    amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a decrease in    our net income. We have developed a hedging program to manage    the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations, but our    program may not effectively eliminate all of the financial    exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations. Additional    information regarding our market risks is contained in    Part II, Item 7A of this    Form 10-K.    10Table of ContentsThe    availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our    manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw    material costs can increase our operating costs.     We manufacture engineered materials using various precious and    non-precious metals, including gold, silver, palladium,    platinum, ruthenium, copper and nickel. The availability of and    prices for these raw materials are subject to volatility and are    influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action,    world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability    of substitute metals, the U.S. dollar exchange rate,    production costs of United States and foreign competitors,    anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors. Decreased    availability and fluctuating prices of precious and non-precious    metals that we use in our manufacturing can increase our    operating costs. For example, prices for copper have been very    volatile in recent months due to global demand and market    conditions. Further, we maintain some precious metals on a    consigned inventory basis. The owners of the precious metals    charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of those    metals and other factors. A significant increase in the market    price of precious metals or the consignment fee could increase    our financing costs, which could increase our operating costs.    We use ruthenium for the manufacture of perpendicular magnetic    recording technology products for the data storage market.    Ruthenium is not widely used or traded on a public market and    therefore there is no established market for hedging price    exposure. Although our selling price is generally based on our    cost to purchase ruthenium, the inventory carrying value may be    exposed to market fluctuations. For example, we experienced a    66% drop in the price of ruthenium during the fourth quarter    2008. Because    we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly    results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be    affected by the fluctuations.     Because many of our European and automotive electronics    customers slow or cease operations during the summer months, we    sometimes experience weaker demand in the quarters ending in    September compared to the quarters ending in March, June and    December. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue, which    causes our quarterly results to fluctuate. If our revenue during    any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or    securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps    significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than    normal levels of demand and other occurrences in any of the    other quarters could also harm our results of operations. Natural    disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages, bankruptcies and    other unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail    production or shut down their operations.     Our customers manufacturing operations are subject to    conditions beyond their control, including raw material    shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power    or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work    stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting    the automotive industry, one of our major markets, and other    unexpected events. For example, in 2005, Delphi Corporation, a    customer of three of our business units and the largest United    States supplier of automotive parts, filed for bankruptcy    protection. To date, Delphi has not emerged from bankruptcy    reorganization. Any of those events could also affect other    suppliers to our customers. In either case, those events could    cause our customers to curtail production or to shut down a    portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their    demand for our products and reduce our sales. Unexpected    events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost    of operating our business.     A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed    regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are    subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the    cost of mining for varying lengths of time.     These conditions include, among other things, fire, natural    disasters, pit wall failures and ore processing changes. Our    mining operations also involve the handling and production of    potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an    explosion could result in death and injuries to employees and    others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any    explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for    damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of    these events could increase our cost of operations.    11Table of ContentsEquipment    failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead    to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining    operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on    critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion,    be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some    equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition    to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the    risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires,    explosions or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or    reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our    customers demands, which could harm our sales and cause    our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of    any interruption in production capability may require us to make    large capital expenditures, which may have a negative effect on    our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption    insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with    interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities. Many    of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source    energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause    manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for    electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is    the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility    for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in    service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures,    terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses    that are not fully covered by our business interruption    insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our    operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to    meet our customers demands and reduce our sales. If the    price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources    increases, our operating expenses could increase    significantly.     We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a    mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel or    other energy sources. See Item 2.     Properties, found on page 16 of this    Form 10-K.    Our operating expenses are sensitive to changes in electricity    prices and fuel prices, including natural gas prices. Prices for    electricity and natural gas have continued to increase and can    fluctuate widely with availability and demand levels from other    users. During periods of peak usage, supplies of energy may be    curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase energy at    historical market rates. While we have some long-term contracts    with energy suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations in energy    costs that can affect our production costs. Although we enter    into forward-fixed price supply contracts for natural gas and    electricity for use in our operations, those contracts are of    limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel or electricity    needs. Price increases in fuel and electricity costs will    continue to increase our cost of operations. We    have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to    those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our    costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our    products on a timely basis.     Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our    manufacturing facility, in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining    operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in    production of most of its beryllium-containing materials.    Additionally, our Reading, Pennsylvania, Fremont, California and    Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are dependent on    materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio manufacturing facility    and our Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent    on our Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. See    Item 2  Properties, found on page 16    of this    Form 10-K.    The destruction or closure of any of our manufacturing    facilities or our mine for a significant period of time as a    result of fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism or other    natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our    manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures    and our costs of doing business and impair our ability to    deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may    need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to    delay production, which could increase our costs of doing    business. Our property damage and business interruption    insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.    12Table of ContentsOur    lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it    difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be    sold to customers.     Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the    generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the    development of the product and the recording of sales, may    typically take up to two or three years, making it very    difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our    inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of    sales of our products, especially newly introduced products,    could affect our ability to meet our customers product    delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to    suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not    translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition,    these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital    expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash    flow requirements. Future    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly    harm our operations.     Future terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may    directly impact our physical facilities. For example, our    Elmore, Ohio facility is located near and derives power from a    nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist    attack. In addition, future terrorist attacks, related armed    conflicts or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East    or other regions of the world could cause consumer confidence    and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods    that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed    forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale    deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the    physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on    weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be    reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also    increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial    markets, which could negatively impact our sales. We may    be unable to access the financial markets on favorable    terms.     The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly    during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could    impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would    increase our capital costs. In particular, the substantial    volatility in world capital markets due to the global economic    crisis has had a significant negative impact on the domestic and    global financial markets.     We rely on access to financial markets as a significant source    of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by cash on    hand or operating cash flow. Our access to the financial markets    could be adversely impacted by various factors, including:           Changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the    ability to renew existing liquidity facilities on acceptable    terms;           A deterioration of our credit;           A deterioration in the financial condition of the banks in which    we do business;           Extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or    credit requirements; and           The collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in    connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our    flexibility in raising additional capital.     All of these factors have adversely impacted our access to the    financial markets at various times over the last five years. The    recent global economic crisis may make it difficult for us to    access the credit market and to obtain financing or refinancing,    as the case may be, to the extent necessary, on satisfactory    terms or at all. Low    investment performance by our domestic pension plan assets may    require us to increase our pension liability and expense, which    may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and    divert funds from other potential uses.     We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.    Our pension expense and our required contributions to our    pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets,    the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of    return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to    measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including    the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present    value, or    13Table of Contents    the discount rate. As of December 31, 2008, for pension    accounting purposes, we assumed an 8.25% rate of return on    pension assets.     Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets    resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly    increase the deficit position of our plans. Should the pension    asset return fall below our expectations, it is likely that    future pension expenses would increase. The actual return on our    plan assets for the twelve months ending December 31, 2008    was a loss of 24%.     We establish the discount rate used to determine the present    value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the    end of each year based upon the available market rates for high    quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount    rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a    lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.     Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates,    including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate    that we will be required to make a cash contribution of    approximately $18.3 million to our pension plan in 2009. If    our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, a    contribution in years beyond 2009 may be greater than the    projected 2009 contribution required.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting    funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Our    expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could be    materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying    assumptions prove to be incorrect.     We also provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible    employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by    the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan    obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care    costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate    future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we    decreased the assumed rate at which health care costs will    increase for the next year to 8% at December 31, 2008 from    9% at December 31, 2007. In addition, we have assumed that    this health care cost increase trend rate will decline to 5% by    2012. We have used the same discount rates for our retiree    health plans that we use for our pension plan accounting.     Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A one    percentage point increase in assumed health care cost trend    rates would have increased the post-employment benefits included    among the liabilities in our balance sheet by $0.8 million    at December 31, 2008.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations,    diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. We are    subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may    negatively affect our financial performance.     A significant portion of our sales is conducted in international    markets and priced in currencies other than the    U.S. dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United    States (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to 35% of sales in    2008, 43% in 2007 and 35% in 2006. A significant part of these    international sales are priced in currencies other than the    U.S. dollar. Significant fluctuations in currency values    relative to the U.S. dollar may negatively affect our    financial performance. In the past, fluctuations in currency    exchange rates, particularly for the euro and the yen, have    impacted our sales, margins and profitability. The fair value of    our net liability relating to outstanding foreign currency    contracts was $1.2 million at December 31, 2008,    indicating that the average hedge rates were unfavorable    compared to the actual year-end market exchange rates. While we    may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the impact of    currency price volatility on our earnings, any hedging    activities may not be successful.    14Table of ContentsOur    holding company structure causes us to rely on funds from our    subsidiaries.     We are a holding company and conduct substantially all our    operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we    are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of    funds from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends and other    payments to us by our subsidiaries may be restricted by, among    other things, applicable corporate and other laws and    regulations, agreements of the subsidiaries and the terms of our    current and future indebtedness. Our    financial results are likely to be negatively impacted by an    impairment of goodwill pursuant to Statement No. 142 should    our shareholder equity exceed our market capitalization for a    number of quarters.     A goodwill impairment charge may be triggered by a reduction in    actual and projected cash flows, which could be negatively    impacted by the market price of our common shares. Our goodwill    balance at December 31, 2008 was $35.8 million. Any    required non-cash impairment charge could significantly reduce    this balance and have a material impact on our reported    financial position and results of operations. "
9,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2008-02-29,">Item 1A.      RISK    FACTORS     Our business, financial condition, results of operations and    cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including but    not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in the Annual    Report on    Form 10-K,    any one of which could cause our actual results to vary    materially from recent results or from our anticipated future    results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks,    including the risks described below. The risks discussed below    are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the    following risks occur, our business, results of operations or    financial condition could be negatively impacted. Health    issues, litigation and government regulation relating to    machining and manufacturing of beryllium-containing products    could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our    ability to operate and adversely affect our    profitability.     If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some    individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium    and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic    beryllium disease, or CBD.  Some people who are diagnosed with    CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all.  In others, the    disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing    clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing and    coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.     Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an    association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and    certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium    and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.    6     The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been,    and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the    beryllium-containing products industry.  The health risks    associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability    claims, employee and third-party lawsuits and increased levels    of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and international    regulatory authorities.  Concerns over CBD and other potential    adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as    concerns regarding potential liability from the use of    beryllium, may discourage our customers use of our    beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand    for our products.  In addition, continued or increased adverse    media coverage relating to our beryllium-containing products    could damage our reputation or cause a decrease in demand for    beryllium-containing products, which could adversely affect our    profitability.     We are presently uninsured for beryllium-related claims where    the claimants first exposure to beryllium occurred on or    after January 1, 2008, and we have not undertaken to    estimate the impact of such claims, which have yet to be    asserted.  In addition, some jurisdictions preclude insurance    coverage for punitive damages awards.  Accordingly, our    profitability could be adversely affected if any current or    future claimants obtain judgments for any uninsured compensatory    or punitive damages. Further, an unfavorable outcome or    settlement of a pending beryllium case or additional adverse    media coverage could encourage the commencement of additional    similar litigation. Our    bertrandite ore mining and beryllium-related manufacturing    operations and our customers businesses are subject to    extensive health and safety regulations that impose, and will    continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities, and    future regulation could increase those costs and liabilities or    effectively prohibit production or use of beryllium-containing    products.     Our customers and we are subject to laws regulating worker    exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are    under review by the United States Occupational Safety and Health    Administration and by other governmental and private    standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will    likely be more stringent worker safety standards. The    development, proposal or adoption of more stringent standards    may affect buying decisions by the users of beryllium-containing    products. If the standards are made more stringent and/or our    customers or other downstream users decide to reduce their use    of beryllium-containing products, our operating results,    liquidity and capital resources could be materially adversely    affected. The impact of this potential adverse effect would    depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the standards,    the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the extent of    any reduction in customer use and other factors. The magnitude    of this potential adverse effect cannot be estimated. Our    bertrandite ore mining and manufacturing operations are subject    to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and will    continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on us, and    future regulation could increase these costs and liabilities or    prevent production of beryllium-containing    products.     We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating    to the environment, including those relating to our handling of    hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some    environmental laws impose substantial penalties for    noncompliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive    Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose    strict, retroactive and joint and several liability upon    entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances.    Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental    regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing    requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and    restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials    into the environment and the effects that mining has on    groundwater quality and availability. If we fail to comply with    present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could    be subject to liabilities or our operations could be    interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and    regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities    or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. They could also require    us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant    expenses in connection with our business, which would increase    our costs of production.    7 The    availability of competitive substitute materials for    beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers    demand for these products and reduce our sales.     In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers    of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic    composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum.    Our customers may choose to use substitutes for    beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of    reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those    substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these    products and the risk of litigation relating to    beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes    for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand    for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could    reduce our sales. The    markets for our beryllium-containing and    non-beryllium-containing products are experiencing rapid changes    in technology.     We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing    technology and evolving customer specifications and industry    standards. New products may quickly render an existing product    obsolete and unmarketable. For example, at one time we produced    beryllium-copper alloys that were used in the production of some    golf club heads, however, these beryllium-copper alloy club    heads are no longer produced by any of our customers. Our growth    and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability    to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed    products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and    evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological    advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer    specifications, achieve market acceptance and respond to our    competitors products.     The process of developing new products can be technologically    challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of    technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce    new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail    to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or    fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we    may be unable to recover our significant research and    development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and    profitability. Our    beryllium-containing and non-beryllium-containing products are    deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects    that we find only after deployment.     Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in    complicated applications and may contain undetected defects,    errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested    during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be    fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For    example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil    form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its    specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer    stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected. In    addition, the Company has experienced on one occasion, a quality    issue during the manufacturing ramp up of a new product.    Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the    products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects,    errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product    returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion    of our resources, increased service and warranty costs and other    losses to our customers, end users or to us. Any of these    occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market    acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation,    which could reduce our sales. Our    customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of    the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to    general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their    demand for our products and reduce our sales.     A substantial number of our customers are in the    telecommunications and computer, data storage, aerospace and    defense, automotive electronics, industrial components,    appliance and medical industries. Each of these industries is    cyclical in nature, influenced by a combination of factors which    could have a negative impact on our business, including, among    other things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength    or weakness of the United States dollar, the strength of the    consumer electronics, automotive electronics and computer    industries and the rate of construction of telecommunications    infrastructure equipment and government spending on defense.    8     Also, in times when growth rates in our markets slow down, there    may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers that may    negatively affect our business. The    demand for our products is generally affected by macroeconomic    fluctuations in the global economies in which we sell our    products. Future economic downturns, stagnant economies or    global currency fluctuations could also negatively affect our    financial performance.     Our business is dependent on continued capital spending by the    global telecommunications and computer industries, and a    decrease in capital spending for infrastructure and equipment    could affect our revenue from these markets. Our business could    be exposed to unexpected or extended downturns in capital    spending, which could adversely affect our sales. In addition, a    decrease in military, aerospace or defense-related spending    could adversely reduce demand for our products. We may    not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully    integrate acquired businesses.     We have been active over the last three years in pursuing niche    acquisitions for one of our subsidiaries, Williams Advanced    Materials Inc. We intend to continue to consider further growth    opportunities through the acquisition of assets or companies and    routinely review acquisition opportunities. We cannot predict    whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition    opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would    be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of    significant funds and management time. Depending upon the    nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may be    required to raise additional financing, which may not be    available to us on acceptable terms. Further, we may not be able    to successfully integrate any acquired business with our    existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from    any completed acquisition. The    terms of our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our    growth and acquisition strategies.     The terms of our credit facilities restrict our ability to,    among other things, borrow and make investments and acquire    other businesses. In addition, the terms of our indebtedness    require us to satisfy specified financial covenants. Our ability    to comply with these provisions depends, in part, on factors    over which we may have no control. These restrictions could    adversely affect our ability to pursue our growth and    acquisition strategies. If we breach any of our financial    covenants or fail to make scheduled payments, our creditors    could declare all amounts owed to them to be immediately due and    payable, and we may not have sufficient available funds to repay    the amounts due, in which case we may be required to seek legal    protection from our creditors. We    conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide    basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing    business outside the United States.     We sell to customers outside of the United States from our    United States and international operations. We have been and are    continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia.    Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted    for approximately 43% of our sales in 2007, 35% in 2006 and 33%    in 2005. We anticipate that international shipments will account    for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable    future. Revenue from    non-U.S.    operations (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to    approximately 23% of our sales in 2007, 23% in 2006 and 25% in    2005. There are a number of risks associated with international    business activities, including:           burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting    foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements,    tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety    requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;           difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States    government;           political and economic instability and disruptions, including    terrorist attacks;           potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or    differing tax structures; and           fluctuations in currency exchange rates.     Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly for the    euro and the yen, have impacted our sales, margins and    profitability in the past. The fair value of our net liability    relating to outstanding foreign currency contracts    9     was $1.5 million at December 31, 2007, indicating    that the average hedge rates were unfavorable compared to the    actual year-end market exchange rates. Additionally, foreign and    international regulations have also impacted our sales, margins    and profitability in the past. See also  Health    issues, litigation and government regulation relating to    machining and manufacturing of beryllium-containing products    could significantly reduce demand for our products, limit our    ability to operate and adversely affect our profitability,    found on page 6 and  Our bertrandite ore    mining and beryllium-related manufacturing operations and our    customers businesses are subject to extensive health and    safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose,    significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could    increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit    production or use of beryllium-containing products, found    on page 7. Further, any of these risks could continue in    the future. A    major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate    obligations, which subjects us to interest rate    fluctuations.     Our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our    assets (other than non-mining real property and certain other    assets). Our working capital    line-of-credit    includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest    rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service    obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase    even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a    decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging program    to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations,    but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the    financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations.    We currently have an instrument in place that has the effect of    fixing the interest rate on a portion of our outstanding debt    through December 2008. Additional information regarding our    market risks is contained in Part II, Item 7A of this    document. The    availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our    manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw    material costs can increase our operating costs.     We manufacture engineered materials using various precious and    non-precious metals, including gold, silver, palladium,    platinum, ruthenium, copper and nickel. The availability of and    prices for these raw materials are subject to volatility and are    influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action,    world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability    of substitute metals, the United States dollar exchange rate,    production costs of United States and foreign competitors,    anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors. Decreased    availability and fluctuating prices of precious and non-precious    metals that we use in our manufacturing can increase our    operating costs. For example, prices for copper have recently    reached an all-time high due to, among other things, smelting    capacity and increased demand from China. Further, we maintain    some precious metals on a consigned inventory basis. The owners    of the precious metals charge a fee that fluctuates based on the    market price of those metals and other factors. A significant    increase in the market price of precious metals or the    consignment fee could increase our financing costs, which could    increase our operating costs. We use ruthenium for the    manufacture of perpendicular magnetic recording technology    products for the data storage market. Ruthenium is not widely    used or traded on a public market and therefore there is no    established market for hedging price exposure. Although our    selling price is generally based on our cost to purchase    ruthenium, the inventory carrying value may be exposed to market    fluctuations. Because    we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly    results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be    affected by the fluctuations.     Because many of our European and automotive electronics    customers slow or cease operations during the summer months, we    sometimes experience weaker demand in the quarters ending in    September compared to the quarters ending in March, June and    December. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue, which    causes our quarterly results to fluctuate. If our revenue during    any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or    securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps    significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than    normal levels of demand and other occurrences in any of the    other quarters could also harm our operating results.    10 Natural    disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages, bankruptcies and    other unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail    production or shut down their operations.     Our customers manufacturing operations are subject to    conditions beyond their control, including raw material    shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power    or other energy services, equipment failures, bankruptcies, work    stoppages due to strikes or lockouts, including those affecting    the automotive industry, one of our major markets, and other    unexpected events. For example, in 2005, Delphi Corporation, a    customer of three of our business units and the largest U.S.    supplier of automotive parts, filed for bankruptcy protection.    Any of those events could also affect other suppliers to our    customers. In either case, those events could cause our    customers to curtail production or to shut down a portion or all    of their operations, which could reduce their demand for our    products and reduce our sales. Unexpected    events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost    of operating our business.     A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed    regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are    subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the    cost of mining for varying lengths of time.     These conditions include, among other things, fire, natural    disasters, pit wall failures and ore processing changes. Our    mining operations also involve the handling and production of    potentially explosive materials. It is possible that an    explosion could result in death and injuries to employees and    others and material property damage to third parties and us. Any    explosion could expose us to adverse publicity or liability for    damages and materially adversely affect our operations. Any of    these events could increase our cost of operations. Equipment    failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead    to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining    operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on    critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion,    be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some    equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition    to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the    risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires,    explosions or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or    reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our    customers demands, which could harm our sales and cause    our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of    any interruption in production capability may require us to make    large capital expenditures, which may have a negative effect on    our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption    insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with    interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities. Many    of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source    energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause    manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for    electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is    the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility    for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in    service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures,    terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses    that are not fully covered by our business interruption    insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our    operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to    meet our customers demands and reduce our sales. If the    price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources    increases, our operating expenses could increase    significantly.     We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a    mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel or    other energy sources. See Item 2.     Properties, found on page 15. Our operating expenses    are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices,    including natural gas prices. Prices for electricity and natural    gas have continued to increase and can fluctuate widely with    availability and demand levels from other users. During periods    of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed, and we may    not be able to purchase energy at historical market rates. While    we have some long-term contracts with energy suppliers, we are    exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our    production costs. Although we enter into forward fixed price    supply    11     contracts for natural gas and electricity for use in our    operations, those contracts are of limited duration and do not    cover all of our fuel or electricity needs. Price increases in    fuel and electricity costs will continue to increase our cost of    operations. We    have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to    those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our    costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our    products on a timely basis.     Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our    manufacturing facility, in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining    operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in    production of most of its beryllium-containing materials.    Additionally, our Shoemakersville, Pennsylvania, Fremont,    California and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are    dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio    manufacturing facility and our Wheatfield, New York    manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York    manufacturing facility. See Item 2     Properties, found on page 15. The destruction or    closure of any of our manufacturing facilities or our mine for a    significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, act    of war or terrorism or other natural disaster or unexpected    event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our    capital expenditures and our costs of doing business and impair    our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In such    an event, we may need to resort to an alternative source of    manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our    costs of doing business. Our property damage and business    interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses    and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms,    if at all. Our    lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it    difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be    sold to customers.     Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the    generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the    development of the product and the recording of sales, may    typically take up to two or three years, making it very    difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our    inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of    sales of our products, especially newly introduced products,    could affect our ability to meet our customers product    delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to    suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not    translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition,    these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital    expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash    flow requirements. Future    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly    harm our operations.     Future terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may    directly impact our physical facilities. For example, our    Elmore, Ohio facility is located near and derives power from a    nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist    attack. In addition, future terrorist attacks, related armed    conflicts or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East    or other regions of the world could cause consumer confidence    and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods    that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed    forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale    deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the    physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on    weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be    reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also    increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial    markets, which could negatively impact our sales. We may    be unable to access the financial markets on favorable    terms.     The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly    during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could    impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would    increase our capital costs. We rely on access to financial    markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital    requirements not satisfied by cash on hand or operating cash    flow. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely    impacted by various factors, including:           Changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the    ability to renew existing liquidity facilities on acceptable    terms;           A deterioration of our credit;    12            Extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or    credit requirements;           A material breakdown in our risk management procedures; and           The collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in    connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our    flexibility in raising additional capital.     All of these factors, except a material breakdown in our risk    management procedures, have adversely impacted our access to the    financial markets at various times over the last five years. Low    investment performance by our domestic pension plan assets may    require us to increase our pension liability and expense, which    may require us to fund a portion of our pension obligations and    divert funds from other potential uses.     We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.    Our pension expense and our required contributions to our    pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets,    the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of    return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to    measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including    the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present    value, or the discount rate. As of December 31, 2007, for    pension accounting purposes, we assumed an 8.25% rate of return    on pension assets.     Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets    resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly    increase the deficit position of our plans. Should the assets    earn an average return less than 8.25% over time, it is likely    that future pension expenses would increase.  The actual return    on our plan assets for the twelve months ending    December 31, 2007 was 5.8% and the ten-year average    annualized return as of year-end 2007 was 6.5%.     We establish the discount rate used to determine the present    value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the    end of each year based upon the available market rates for high    quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount    rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a    lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.     Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates,    including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate    that we will be required to make a cash contribution of    approximately $4.5 million to our pension plan in 2008. If    our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, a    contribution in years beyond 2008 may be greater than the    projected 2008 contribution required.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting    funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Our    expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could be    materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying    assumptions prove to be incorrect.     We also provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible    employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by    the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan    obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care    costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate    future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we    increased the assumed rate at which health care costs will    increase for the next year to 9% at December 31, 2007 from    8% at December 31, 2006. In addition, we have assumed that    this health care cost increase trend rate will decline to 5% by    2012. We have used the same discount rates for our retiree    health plans that we use for our pension plan accounting.     Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A 1.0%    increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have    increased the post-employment benefits included among the    liabilities in our balance sheet by $0.9 million at    December 31, 2007.    13     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations,    diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. We are    subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may    negatively affect our financial performance.     A significant portion of our sales is conducted in international    markets and priced in currencies other than the United States    dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United States    (principally Europe and Asia) amount to 43% of sales for 2007,    35% of sales for 2006 and 33% of sales for 2005. A significant    part of these international sales are priced in currencies other    than the U.S. dollar. Significant fluctuations in currency    values relative to the United States dollar may negatively    affect our financial performance. While we may hedge our    currency transactions to mitigate the impact of currency price    volatility on our earnings, any hedging activities may not be    successful. Our    holding company structure causes us to rely on funds from our    subsidiaries.     We are a holding company and conduct substantially all our    operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we    are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of    funds from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends and other    payments to us by our subsidiaries may be restricted by, among    other things, applicable corporate and other laws and    regulations, agreements of the subsidiaries and the terms of our    current and future indebtedness. "
11,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2007-03-15,">Item 1A.      RISK    FACTORS     Our business, financial condition, results of operations and    cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including but    not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in the Annual    Report on    Form 10-K,    any one of which could cause our actual results to vary    materially from recent results or from our anticipated future    results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks,    including the risks described below. The risks discussed below    are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the    following risks occur, our business, results of operations or    financial condition could be negatively impacted. Health    issues and litigation relating to machining and manufacturing of    beryllium-containing products could significantly reduce demand    for our products, limit our ability to operate and cause us to    pay material amounts in respect of product liability    claims.     If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some    individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium    and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic    beryllium disease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with    CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the    disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing    clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing and    coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.     Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an    association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and    certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium    and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.    6Table of Contents     The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been,    and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the    beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks    associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability    claims, employee and third-party lawsuits and increased levels    of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and international    regulatory authorities. Concerns over CBD and other potential    adverse health effects relating to beryllium, as well as    concerns regarding potential liability from the use of    beryllium, may discourage our customers use of our    beryllium-containing products and significantly reduce demand    for our products.     One of our subsidiaries, Brush Wellman Inc., is a defendant in    proceedings in various state and federal courts brought by    plaintiffs alleging that they have contracted, or have been    placed at risk of contracting, chronic beryllium disease or    other lung conditions as a result of exposure to beryllium.    Plaintiffs in beryllium cases seek recovery under negligence and    various other legal theories and seek compensatory and punitive    damages, in many cases of an unspecified sum. Spouses, if any,    claim loss of consortium. As of December 31, 2006 there    were 13 cases pending. Approximately 85% of our pending    beryllium-related claims are covered by various syndicates of    Lloyds of London (now reinsured through Equitas Holdings    Limited) and other London insurance market companies, some of    whom are or may become insolvent. If our insurance carriers are    insolvent or become insolvent, we may become directly    responsible for payments relating to product liability claims,    which could divert funds from other intended purposes, including    capital expenditures or other operating requirements.     Our profitability could be affected adversely by unfavorable    results in one or more of those cases. In addition, continued or    increased adverse media coverage relating to our    beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or    cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products,    which could adversely affect our profitability. Further, an    unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or    additional adverse media coverage could encourage the    commencement of additional similar litigation. We are unable to    estimate the potential exposure to unasserted claims. We are    currently self-insured for product liability claims based on    exposure to beryllium after July 2001, and we may incur material    losses from those claims, which could adversely affect our    profitability.     Although we have varying levels of insurance coverage from    insurance carriers for product liability claims based on    exposure to beryllium for most periods prior to July 2001, we    are self-insured for product liability claims based on exposure    to beryllium after July 2001 and for a short period in the    1980s. We may not be able to provide adequate coverage against    all potential liabilities. We may incur significant losses from    claims for which we are self-insured. Our    bertrandite ore mining and our manufacturing operations and our    customers businesses are subject to extensive health and    safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose,    significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could    increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit    production or use of beryllium-containing    products.     We and our customers are subject to laws regulating worker    exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are    under review by the United States Occupational Safety and Health    Administration and by other governmental and private    standard-setting organizations. One result of these reviews will    likely be more stringent worker safety standards. More stringent    standards may affect buying decisions by the users of    beryllium-containing products. If the standards are made more    stringent or our customers decide to reduce their use of    beryllium-containing products, our operating results, liquidity    and capital resources could be materially adversely affected.    The extent of this adverse effect would depend on the nature and    extent of the changes to the standards, the cost and ability to    meet the new standards, the extent of any reduction in customer    use and other factors that cannot be estimated. Our    bertrandite ore mining and our manufacturing operations are    subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and    will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on    us, and future regulation could increase these costs and    liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing    products.     We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating    to the environment, including those relating to our handling of    hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some    environmental laws impose    7Table of Contents    substantial penalties for noncompliance. Others, such as the    federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and    Liability Act, impose strict, retroactive and joint and several    liability upon entities responsible for releases of hazardous    substances. Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive    governmental regulation on matters such as permitting and    licensing requirements, plant and wildlife protection,    reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge    of materials into the environment and the effects that mining    has on groundwater quality and availability. If we fail to    comply with present and future environmental laws and    regulations, we could be subject to liabilities or our    operations could be interrupted. In addition, future    environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to    expand our facilities or extract our bertrandite ore deposits.    They could also require us to acquire costly equipment or to    incur other significant expenses in connection with our    business, which would increase our costs of production. The    availability of competitive substitute materials for    beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers    demand for these products and reduce our sales.     In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers    of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic    composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum.    Our customers may choose to use substitutes for    beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of    reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those    substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these    products and the risk of litigation relating to    beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes    for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand    for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could    reduce our sales. The    markets for our beryllium-containing and    non-beryllium-containing products are experiencing rapid changes    in technology.     We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing    technology and evolving customer specifications and industry    standards. New products may quickly render an existing product    obsolete and unmarketable. For example, at one time we produced    beryllium-copper alloys that were used in the production of some    golf club heads, however, these beryllium-copper alloy club    heads are no longer produced by any of our customers. Our growth    and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability    to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed    products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and    evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological    advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer    specifications, achieve market acceptance and respond to our    competitors products.     The process of developing new products can be technologically    challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of    technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce    new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail    to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or    fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we    may be unable to recover our significant research and    development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and    profitability. Our    beryllium-containing and non-beryllium-containing products are    deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects    that we find only after deployment.     Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in    complicated applications and may contain undetected defects,    errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested    during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be    fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For    example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil    form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its    specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer    stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected.    Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the    products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects,    errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product    returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion    of our resources, increased service and warranty costs and other    losses to us or to our customers or end users. Any of these    occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market    acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation,    which could reduce our sales.    8Table of Contents We    have incurred significant losses in the past, and may not be    able to sustain profitability on an ongoing basis.     Although we have been profitable in 2004, 2005 and 2006 (net    income of $15.5 million, $17.8 million and    $49.6 million, respectively), we have incurred significant    losses in the past (net loss of $35.6 million in 2002 and    $13.2 million in 2003) and may not be able to sustain    this recent profitability on an ongoing basis. We have    implemented strategic initiatives designed to improve our    operating performance on an ongoing basis. We may not be able to    successfully implement or realize the expected benefits of any    of those initiatives or sustain improvements made to date. We    may not meet our strategic goals or sustain profitability if we    fail to achieve the goals of these initiatives. Our    customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of    the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to    general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their    demand for our products and reduce our sales.     A substantial number of our customers are in the    telecommunications and computer, data storage, aerospace and    defense, automotive electronics, industrial components and    appliance industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in    nature, influenced by a combination of factors which could have    a negative impact on our business, including, among other    things, periods of economic growth or recession, strength or    weakness of the United States dollar, the strength of the    consumer electronics, automotive electronics and computer    industries and the rate of construction of telecommunications    infrastructure equipment and government spending on defense.    Also, in times when growth rates in our markets slow down, there    may be temporary inventory adjustments by our customers, that    may negatively affect our business. The    demand for our products is generally affected by macroeconomic    fluctuations in the global economies in which we sell our    products. Future economic downturns, stagnant economies or    global currency fluctuations could also negatively affect our    financial performance.     Our business is dependent on continued capital spending by the    global telecommunications and computer industries, and a    decrease in capital spending for infrastructure and equipment    could affect our revenue from these markets. Our business could    be exposed to unexpected or extended downturns in capital    spending, which could adversely affect our sales. In addition, a    decrease in military, aerospace or defense-related spending    could adversely reduce demand for our products. We may    not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully    integrate acquired businesses.     We have been active over the last 24 months in pursuing    niche acquisitions for one of our subsidiaries, Williams    Advanced Materials Inc. We intend to continue to consider    further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets    or companies and routinely review acquisition opportunities. We    cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing any    acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any    acquisition would be. Future acquisitions may involve the    expenditure of significant funds and management time. Depending    upon the nature, size and timing of future acquisitions, we may    be required to raise additional financing, which may not be    available to us on acceptable terms. Further, we may not be able    to successfully integrate any acquired business with our    existing businesses or recognize any expected advantages from    any completed acquisition. The    terms of our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our    growth and acquisition strategies.     The terms of our credit facilities restrict our ability to,    among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other    businesses and make capital expenditures. In addition, the terms    of our indebtedness require us to satisfy specified financial    covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions depends,    in part, on factors over which we may have no control. These    restrictions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our    growth and acquisition strategies. If we breach any of our    financial covenants or fail to make scheduled payments, our    creditors could declare all amounts owed to them to be    immediately due and payable, and we may not have sufficient    available funds to repay the amounts due, in which case we may    be required to seek legal protection from our creditors.    9Table of Contents We    conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide    basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing    business outside the United States.     We sell to customers outside of the United States from our    United States and international operations. We have been and are    continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia.    Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted    for approximately 35% of our sales in 2006 and 33% in 2005 and    2004. We anticipate that international shipments will account    for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable    future. Revenue from    non-United    States operations (principally Europe and Asia) amounted to    approximately 23% of our sales in 2006, 25% in 2005 and 24% in    2004. There are a number of risks associated with international    business activities, including:           burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting    foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements,    tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety    requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;           difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States    government;           political and economic instability and disruptions, including    terrorist attacks;           potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or    differing tax structures; and           fluctuations in currency exchange rates.     Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly for the    euro and the yen, have impacted our sales, margins and    profitability in the past. The fair value of our net liability    relating to outstanding foreign currency contracts was    ($0.8) million at December 31, 2006, indicating that    the average hedge rates were unfavorable compared to the actual    year-end market exchange rates. Additionally, foreign and    international regulations have also impacted our sales, margins    and profitability in the past. See also  Health    issues and litigation relating to machining and manufacturing of    beryllium-containing products could significantly reduce demand    for our products, limit our ability to operate and cause us to    pay material amounts in respect of product liability    claims, found on page 6 and  Our    bertrandite ore mining and our manufacturing operations and our    customers businesses are subject to extensive health and    safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose,    significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could    increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit    production or use of beryllium-containing products, found    on page 7. Further, any of these risks could continue in    the future. A    major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate    obligations, which subjects us to interest rate    fluctuations.     Our credit facilities are secured by working capital and certain    assets, such as plant, property and equipment. Our working    capital    line-of-credit    includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest    rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service    obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase    even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a    decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging program    to manage the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations,    but our program may not effectively eliminate all of the    financial exposure associated with interest rate fluctuations.    We currently have an instrument in place that has the effect of    fixing the interest rate on a portion of our outstanding debt    for two years. In addition, the appraised value of the    collateral may not allow us to take advantage of the full    capacity of our line of credit. For additional information    regarding our market risks, please refer to pages 31 and 32    of our annual report to shareholders for the period ended    December 31, 2006. The    availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our    manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw    material costs can increase our operating costs.     We manufacture engineered materials using various precious and    non-precious metals, including gold, silver, palladium,    platinum, ruthenium, copper and nickel. The availability of and    prices for these raw materials are subject to volatility and are    influenced by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action,    world supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability    of substitute metals, the United States dollar exchange rate,    production costs of United States and foreign competitors,    anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors. Decreased    10Table of Contents    availability and fluctuating prices of precious and non-precious    metals that we use in our manufacturing can increase our    operating costs. For example, prices for copper have recently    reached an all-time high due to, among other things, smelting    capacity and increased demand from China. Further, we maintain    some precious metals on a consigned inventory basis. The owners    of the precious metals charge a fee that fluctuates based on the    market price of those metals and other factors. A significant    increase in the market price of precious metals or the    consignment fee could increase our financing costs, which could    increase our operating costs. We use ruthenium for the    manufacture of perpendicular magnetic recording technology    products for the data storage market. Ruthenium is not widely    used or traded on a public market and therefore there is no    established market for hedging price exposure. Although our    selling price is generally based on our cost to purchase    ruthenium, the inventory carrying value may be exposed to market    fluctuations. Because    we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly    results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be    affected by the fluctuations.     Because many of our European and automotive electronics    customers slow or cease operations during the summer months, we    sometimes experience weaker demand in the quarters ending in    September compared to the quarters ending in March, June and    December. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue, which    causes our quarterly results to fluctuate. If our revenue during    any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or    securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps    significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than    normal levels of demand and other occurrences in any of the    other quarters could also harm our operating results. Natural    disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages and other    unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail production    or shut down their operations.     Our customers manufacturing operations are subject to    conditions beyond their control, including raw material    shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power    or other energy services, equipment failures, work stoppages due    to strikes or lockouts, particularly those affecting the    automotive industry, one of our major markets, and other    unexpected events. Any of those events could also affect other    suppliers to our customers. In either case, those events could    cause our customers to curtail production or to shut down a    portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their    demand for our products and reduce our sales. Unexpected    events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost    of operating our business.     A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed    regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are    subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the    cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions    include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall    failures and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also    involve the handling and production of potentially explosive    materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in    death and injuries to employees and others and material property    damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to    adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially    adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could    increase our cost of operations. Equipment    failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead    to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining    operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on    critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion,    be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some    equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition    to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the    risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires,    explosions or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or    reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our    customers demands, which could harm our sales and cause    our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of    any interruption in production capability may require us to make    large capital expenditures which may have a negative effect on    our profitability and cash flows. Our business interruption    insurance may not cover all of the lost revenues associated with    interruptions in our manufacturing capabilities.    11Table of Contents Many    of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source    energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause    manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for    electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is    the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility    for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in    service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures,    terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses    that are not fully covered by our business interruption    insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our    operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to    meet our customers demands and reduce our sales. If the    price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources    increases, our operating expenses could increase    significantly.     We have numerous milling and manufacturing facilities and a    mining operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel or    other energy sources. See Item 2.     Properties, found on page 15. Our operating expenses    are sensitive to changes in electricity prices and fuel prices,    including natural gas prices. Prices for electricity and natural    gas have continued to increase and can fluctuate widely with    availability and demand levels from other users. During periods    of peak usage, supplies of energy may be curtailed, and we may    not be able to purchase energy at historical market rates. While    we have some long-term contracts with energy suppliers, we are    exposed to fluctuations in energy costs that can affect our    production costs. Although we enter into forward fixed price    supply contracts for natural gas and electricity for use in our    operations, those contracts are of limited duration and do not    cover all of our fuel or electricity needs. Price increases in    fuel and electricity costs will continue to increase our cost of    operations. We    have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to    those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our    costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our    products on a timely basis.     Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our    manufacturing facility, in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining    operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in    production of most of its beryllium-containing materials.    Additionally, our Shoemakersville, Pennsylvania, Fremont,    California and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are    dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio    manufacturing facility and our Wheatfield, New York    manufacturing facility is dependent on our Buffalo, New York    manufacturing facility. See Item 2     Properties, found on page 15. The destruction or    closure of any of our manufacturing facilities or our mine for a    significant period of time as a result of fire, explosion, act    of war or terrorism or other natural disaster or unexpected    event may interrupt our manufacturing capabilities, increase our    capital expenditures and our costs of doing business and impair    our ability to deliver our products on a timely basis. In such    an event, we may need to resort to an alternative source of    manufacturing or to delay production, which could increase our    costs of doing business. Our property damage and business    interruption insurance may not cover all of our potential losses    and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms,    if at all. Our    lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it    difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be    sold to customers.     Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the    generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the    development of the product and the recording of sales, may    typically take up to two or three years, making it very    difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our    inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of    sales of our products, especially newly introduced products,    could affect our ability to meet our customers product    delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to    suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not    translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition,    these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital    expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash    flow requirements.    12Table of Contents Future    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly    harm our operations.     Future terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may    directly impact our physical facilities. For example, our    Elmore, Ohio facility is located near and derives power from a    nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist    attack. In addition, future terrorist attacks, related armed    conflicts or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East    or other regions of the world could cause consumer confidence    and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods    that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed    forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale    deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the    physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on    weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be    reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also    increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial    markets, which could negatively impact our sales. We may    be unable to access the financial markets on favorable    terms.     The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly    during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could    impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would    increase our capital costs. We rely on access to financial    markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital    requirements not satisfied by cash on hand or operating cash    flow. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely    impacted by various factors, including:           Changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the    ability to renew existing liquidity facilities on acceptable    terms;           A deterioration of our credit;           Extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or    credit requirements;           A material breakdown in our risk management procedures; and           The collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in    connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our    flexibility in raising additional capital.     All of these factors, except a material breakdown in our risk    management procedures, have adversely impacted our access to the    financial markets at various times over the last five years. Low    investment performance by our pension plan assets may require us    to increase our pension liability and expense, which may also    lead us to accelerate funding our pension obligations and divert    funds from other potential uses.     We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.    Our pension expense and our required contributions to our    pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets,    the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of    return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to    measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including    the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present    value, or the discount rate. For pension accounting purposes, we    assumed an 8.5% rate of return on pension assets.     Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets    resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly    increase the deficit position of our plans. Should the assets    earn an average return less than 8.5% over time, it is likely    that future pension expenses would increase. Investment earnings    in excess of 8.5% may reduce future pension expenses. The actual    return on our plan assets for the twelve months ending    December 31, 2006 was 12.5% and the ten-year average    annualized return as of year-end 2006 was 7.8%.     We establish the discount rate used to determine the present    value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the    end of each year based upon the available market rates for high    quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount    rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a    lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.     Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates,    including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate    that we will be required to make a cash contribution of    approximately $3.8 million to our pension plan in    13Table of Contents    2007. If our current assumptions and estimates are not correct,    a contribution in years beyond 2007 may be greater than the    projected 2007 contribution required.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting    funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Our    expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could be    materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying    assumptions prove to be incorrect.     We also provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible    employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by    the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan    obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care    costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate    future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we    decreased the assumed rate at which health care costs will    increase for the next year to 8% at December 31, 2006 from    9% at December 31, 2005. In addition, we have assumed that    this health care cost increase trend rate will decline to 5% by    2010. We have used the same discount rates for our retiree    health plans that we use for our pension plan accounting.     Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A 1.0%    increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have    increased the post-employment benefits included among the    liabilities in our balance sheet by $0.7 million at    December 31, 2006.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations,    diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. We are    subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may    negatively affect our financial performance.     A significant portion of our sales is conducted in international    markets and priced in currencies other than the United States    dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United States    (principally Europe and Asia) amount to 35% for 2006 and 33% for    both 2005 and 2004. A significant part of these international    sales are priced in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.    Significant fluctuations in currency values relative to the    United States dollar may negatively affect our financial    performance. While we may hedge our currency transactions to    mitigate the impact of currency price volatility on our    earnings, any hedging activities may not be successful. Our    holding company structure causes us to rely on funds from our    subsidiaries.     We are a holding company and conduct substantially all our    operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we    are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of    funds from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends and other    payments to us by our subsidiaries may be restricted by, among    other things, applicable corporate and other laws and    regulations, agreements of the subsidiaries and the terms of our    current and future indebtedness. "
15,MTRN,MATERION CORP,2006-03-16,">Item 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     Our business, financial condition, results of operations and    cash flows can be affected by a number of factors, including but    not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in the Annual    Report on    Form 10-K,    any one of which could cause our actual results to vary    materially from recent results or from our anticipated future    results. Therefore, an investment in us involves some risks,    including the risks described below. The risks discussed below    are not the only risks that we may experience. If any of the    following risks occur, our business, results of operations or    financial condition could be negatively impacted.    5Table of ContentsHealth    issues and litigation relating to machining and manufacturing of    beryllium-containing products could significantly reduce demand    for our products, limit our ability to operate and cause us to    pay material amounts in respect of product liability    claims.     If exposed to respirable beryllium fumes, dusts or powder, some    individuals may demonstrate an allergic reaction to beryllium    and may later develop a chronic lung disease known as chronic    beryllium disease, or CBD. Some people who are diagnosed with    CBD do not develop clinical symptoms at all. In others, the    disease can lead to scarring and damage of lung tissue, causing    clinical symptoms that include shortness of breath, wheezing and    coughing. Severe cases of CBD can cause disability or death.     Further, some scientists claim there is evidence of an    association between beryllium exposure and lung cancer, and    certain standard-setting organizations have classified beryllium    and beryllium compounds as human carcinogens.     The health risks relating to exposure to beryllium have been,    and will continue to be, a significant issue confronting the    beryllium-containing products industry. The health risks    associated with beryllium have resulted in product liability    claims, employee and third-party lawsuits and increased levels    of scrutiny by federal, state, foreign and international    regulatory authorities of ours and our customers. Concerns over    CBD and other potential adverse health effects relating to    beryllium, as well as concerns regarding potential liability    from the use of beryllium, may discourage our customers    use of our beryllium-containing products and significantly    reduce demand for our products.     One of our subsidiaries, Brush Wellman Inc., is a defendant in    proceedings in various state and federal courts brought by    plaintiffs alleging that they have contracted, or have been    placed at risk of contracting, chronic beryllium disease or    other lung conditions as a result of exposure to beryllium.    Plaintiffs in beryllium cases seek recovery under negligence and    various other legal theories and seek compensatory and punitive    damages, in many cases of an unspecified sum. Spouses, if any,    claim loss of consortium. As of December 31, 2005 there    were 13 cases pending. Approximately 92% of our pending    beryllium-related claims are covered by various syndicates of    Lloyds of London (now reinsured through Equitas Holdings    Limited) and other London insurance market companies, some of    whom are or may become insolvent. If our insurance carriers are    insolvent or become insolvent, we may become directly    responsible for payments relating to product liability claims,    which could divert funds from other intended purposes, including    capital expenditures or other operating requirements.     Our profitability could be affected adversely by unfavorable    results in one or more of those cases. In addition, continued or    increased adverse media coverage relating to our    beryllium-containing products could damage our reputation or    cause a decrease in demand for beryllium-containing products,    which could adversely affect our profitability. Further, an    unfavorable outcome or settlement of a pending beryllium case or    additional adverse media coverage could encourage the    commencement of additional similar litigation. We are unable to    estimate the potential exposure to unasserted claims. We are    currently self-insured for product liability claims based on    exposure to beryllium after July 2001, and we may incur material    losses from those claims, which could adversely affect our    profitability.     Although we have varying levels of insurance coverage from    insurance carriers for product liability claims based on    exposure to beryllium for most periods prior to July 2001, we    are self-insured for product liability claims based on exposure    to beryllium after July 2001 and for a short period in the    1980s. We may not be able to provide adequate coverage against    all potential liabilities. We may incur significant losses from    claims for which we are self-insured. Our    bertrandite ore mining and our manufacturing operations and our    customers businesses are subject to extensive health and    safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose,    significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could    increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit    production or use of beryllium-containing    products.     We and our customers are subject to laws regulating worker    exposure to beryllium. Standards for exposure to beryllium are    under review by the United States Occupational Safety and Health    Administration and by other    6Table of Contents    governmental and private standard-setting organizations. One    result of these reviews will likely be more stringent worker    safety standards. More stringent standards may affect buying    decisions by the users of beryllium-containing products. If the    standards are made more stringent or our customers decide to    reduce their use of beryllium- containing products, our    operating results, liquidity and capital resources could be    materially adversely affected. The extent of this adverse effect    would depend on the nature and extent of the changes to the    standards, the cost and ability to meet the new standards, the    extent of any reduction in customer use and other factors that    cannot be estimated. Our    bertrandite ore mining and our manufacturing operations are    subject to extensive environmental regulations that impose, and    will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities on    us, and future regulation could increase these costs and    liabilities or prevent production of beryllium-containing    products.     We are subject to a variety of governmental regulations relating    to the environment, including those relating to our handling of    hazardous materials and air and wastewater emissions. Some    environmental laws impose substantial penalties for    noncompliance. Others, such as the federal Comprehensive    Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, impose    strict, retroactive and joint and several liability upon    entities responsible for releases of hazardous substances.    Bertrandite ore mining is also subject to extensive governmental    regulation on matters such as permitting and licensing    requirements, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and    restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials    into the environment and the effects that mining has on    groundwater quality and availability. If we fail to comply with    present and future environmental laws and regulations, we could    be subject to liabilities or our operations could be    interrupted. In addition, future environmental laws and    regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities    or extract our bertrandite ore deposits. They could also require    us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant    expenses in connection with our business, which would increase    our costs of production. The    availability of competitive substitute materials for    beryllium-containing products may reduce our customers    demand for these products and reduce our sales.     In certain product applications, we compete with manufacturers    of non-beryllium-containing products, including organic    composites, metal alloys or composites, titanium and aluminum.    Our customers may choose to use substitutes for    beryllium-containing products in their products for a variety of    reasons, including, among other things, the lower costs of those    substitutes, the health and safety concerns relating to these    products and the risk of litigation relating to    beryllium-containing products. If our customers use substitutes    for beryllium-containing products in their products, the demand    for our beryllium-containing products may decrease, which could    reduce our sales. The    markets for our beryllium-containing and    non-beryllium-containing products are experiencing rapid changes    in technology.     We operate in markets characterized by rapidly changing    technology and evolving customer specifications and industry    standards. New products may quickly render an existing product    obsolete and unmarketable. For example, we used to produce    beryllium-copper alloys that were used in the production of some    golf club heads; however, these beryllium-copper alloy club    heads are no longer produced by any of our customers. Our growth    and future results of operations depend in part upon our ability    to enhance existing products and introduce newly developed    products on a timely basis that conform to prevailing and    evolving industry standards, meet or exceed technological    advances in the marketplace, meet changing customer    specifications, achieve market acceptance and respond to our    competitors products.     The process of developing new products can be technologically    challenging and requires the accurate anticipation of    technological and market trends. We may not be able to introduce    new products successfully or do so on a timely basis. If we fail    to develop new products that are appealing to our customers or    fail to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, we    may be unable to recover our significant research and    development costs, which could adversely affect our margins and    profitability.    7Table of ContentsOur    beryllium-containing and non-beryllium-containing products are    deployed in complex applications and may have errors or defects    that we find only after deployment.     Our products are highly complex, designed to be deployed in    complicated applications and may contain undetected defects,    errors or failures. Although our products are generally tested    during manufacturing, prior to deployment, they can only be    fully tested when deployed in specific applications. For    example, we sell beryllium-copper alloy strip products in a coil    form to some customers, who then stamp the alloy for its    specific purpose. On occasion, it is not until such customer    stamps the alloy that a defect in the alloy is detected.    Consequently, our customers may discover errors after the    products have been deployed. The occurrence of any defects,    errors, or failures could result in installation delays, product    returns, termination of contracts with our customers, diversion    of our resources, increased service and warranty costs and other    losses to us or to our customers or end users. Any of these    occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market    acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation,    which could reduce our sales. We    have incurred significant losses in the past, and may not be    able to sustain profitability on an ongoing basis.     Although we have been profitable in 2004 and 2005 (net income of    $15.5 million and $17.8 million, respectively), we    have incurred significant losses in the past (net loss of    $35.6 million in 2002 and $13.2 million in    2003) and may not be able to sustain this recent    profitability on an ongoing basis. We have implemented strategic    initiatives designed to improve our operating performance on an    ongoing basis. We may not be able to successfully implement or    realize the expected benefits of any of those initiatives or    sustain improvements made to date. We may not meet our strategic    goals or sustain profitability if we fail to achieve the goals    of these initiatives. Our    customers are subject to significant fluctuations as a result of    the cyclical nature of their industries and their sensitivity to    general economic conditions, which could adversely affect their    demand for our products and reduce our sales.     A substantial number of our customers are in the    telecommunications and computer, magnetic and optical data    storage, aerospace and defense and automotive electronics    industries. Each of these industries is cyclical in nature,    influenced by a combination of factors which could have a    negative impact on our business, including, among other things,    periods of economic growth or recession, strength or weakness of    the United States dollar, the strength of the automotive    electronics and computer industries and the rate of construction    of telecommunications infrastructure equipment and government    spending on defense. The    demand for our products is generally affected by macroeconomic    fluctuations in the global economies in which we sell our    products. Future economic downturns, stagnant economies or    global currency fluctuations could also negatively affect our    financial performance.     Our business is dependent on continued capital spending by the    global telecommunications and computer industries, and a    decrease in capital spending for infrastructure and equipment    could affect our revenue from these markets. Our business could    be exposed to unexpected or extended downturns in capital    spending, which could adversely affect our sales. In addition, a    decrease in military, aerospace or defense-related spending    could adversely reduce demand for our products. We may    not be able to complete our acquisition strategy or successfully    integrate acquired businesses.     We have been active over the last twelve months in pursuing    niche acquisitions for one of our subsidiaries, Williams    Advanced Materials Inc. We intend to continue to consider    further growth opportunities through the acquisition of assets    or companies involved in the engineered materials industry and    routinely review acquisition opportunities. While we believe    that there are available a number of potential acquisition    candidates that would complement our businesses, we currently    have no agreements, understandings or arrangements to acquire    any specific business or material assets. We cannot predict    whether we will be successful in pursuing any acquisition    opportunities or what the consequences of any acquisition would    be. Future acquisitions may involve the expenditure of    significant funds and management time. Depending upon the    nature, size and timing of future    8Table of Contents    acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing,    which may not be available to us on acceptable terms. Further,    we may not be able to successfully integrate any acquired    business with our existing businesses or recognize any expected    advantages from any completed acquisition. The    terms of our indebtedness may restrict our ability to pursue our    growth and acquisition strategies.     The terms of our credit facilities restrict our ability to,    among other things, borrow and make investments, acquire other    businesses and make capital expenditures. In addition, the terms    of our indebtedness require us to satisfy specified financial    covenants. Our ability to comply with these provisions depends,    in part, on factors over which we may have no control. These    restrictions could adversely affect our ability to pursue our    growth and acquisition strategies. If we breach any of our    financial covenants or fail to make scheduled payments, our    creditors could declare all amounts owed to them to be    immediately due and payable, and we may not have sufficient    available funds to repay the amounts due, in which case we may    be required to seek legal protection from our creditors. We    conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide    basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing    business outside the United States.     We sell to customers outside of the United States from our    United States and international operations. We have been and are    continuing to expand our geographic reach in Europe and Asia.    Shipments to customers outside of the United States accounted    for approximately 33% of our sales in 2005, 33% in 2004 and 31%    in 2003. We anticipate that international shipments will account    for a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable    future. Revenue from non-United States operations (principally    Europe and Asia) amounted to approximately 25% of our sales in    2005, 24% in 2004 and 22% in 2003. There are a number of risks    associated with international business activities, including:           burdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting    foreign laws and regulations, including export requirements,    tariffs and other barriers, environmental health and safety    requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;           difficulty in obtaining export licenses from the United States    government;           political and economic instability and disruptions, including    terrorist attacks;           potentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or    differing tax structures; and           fluctuations in currency exchange rates.     Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, particularly for the    euro and the yen, have impacted our sales, margins and    profitability in the past. The fair value of our asset relating    to outstanding foreign currency contracts was $1.5 million    at December 31, 2005, indicating that the average hedge    rates were favorable compared to the actual year-end market    exchange rates. Additionally, foreign and international    regulations have also impacted our sales, margins and    profitability in the past. See also  Health    issues and litigation relating to machining and manufacturing of    beryllium-containing products could significantly reduce demand    for our products, limit our ability to operate and cause us to    pay material amounts in respect of product liability    claims, found on page 5 and  Our    bertrandite ore mining and our manufacturing operations and our    customers businesses are subject to extensive health and    safety regulations that impose, and will continue to impose,    significant costs and liabilities, and future regulation could    increase those costs and liabilities or effectively prohibit    production or use of beryllium-containing products, found    on page 6. Further, any of these risks could continue in    the future. A    major portion of our bank debt consists of variable-rate    obligations, which subjects us to interest rate    fluctuations.     Our credit facilities are secured by working capital and certain    assets, such as plant, property and equipment. Our working    capital    line-of-credit    includes variable-rate obligations, which expose us to interest    rate risks. If interest rates increase, our debt service    obligations on our variable-rate indebtedness would increase    even if the amount borrowed remained the same, resulting in a    decrease in our net income. We have developed a hedging    9Table of Contents    program to manage the risks associated with interest rate    fluctuations, but our program may not effectively eliminate all    of the financial exposure associated with interest rate    fluctuations. We currently have an instrument in place that has    the effect of fixing the interest rate on a portion of our    outstanding debt for three years. In addition, the appraised    value of the collateral may not allow us to take advantage of    the full capacity of our line of credit. For additional    information regarding our market risks, please refer to    pages 28 and 29 of our annual report to shareholders for    the period ended December 31, 2005. Our    tax position may create volatility in our net income, and our    ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and    alternative minimum tax credits may be impaired.     At December 31, 2005, we had a deferred tax asset of    approximately $11.1 million relating to alternative minimum    tax credits and approximately $20.8 million of net    operating loss carryforwards. We evaluated our deferred tax    assets and determined it is more likely than not that    $5.9 million will be realized, while $19.9 million is    subject to a valuation allowance. If we continue to generate    pre-tax profit, all or a significant portion of the remaining    valuation allowance of $19.9 million will be reversed. If    subsequent years generate pre-tax losses, all or a portion of    the $5.9 million asset may require a valuation allowance    that will be reflected as tax expense. The    availability and prices of some raw materials we use in our    manufacturing operations fluctuate, and increases in raw    material costs can increase our operating costs.     We manufacture engineered materials using various precious and    non-precious metals, including gold, silver, palladium,    platinum, copper and nickel. The availability of and prices for    these raw materials are subject to volatility and are influenced    by worldwide economic conditions, speculative action, world    supply and demand balances, inventory levels, availability of    substitute metals, the United States dollar exchange rate,    production costs of United States and foreign competitors,    anticipated or perceived shortages and other factors. Decreased    availability and fluctuating prices of precious and non-precious    metals that we use in our manufacturing can increase our    operating costs. For example, prices for copper have recently    reached an all-time high due to, among other things, smelting    capacity and increased demand from China. We currently cannot    pass on the increased cost of copper to all of our customers.    Further, we maintain some precious metals on a consigned    inventory basis. Should the market price for precious metals    increase by 15% from the prices on December 31, 2005, the    additional pre-tax cost to us on an annual basis would be    approximately $0.2 million. The owners of the precious    metals charge a fee that fluctuates based on the market price of    those metals and other factors. A significant increase in the    market price of precious metals or the consignment fee could    increase our financing costs, which could increase our operating    costs. Because    we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales, our quarterly    results will fluctuate, and our annual performance will be    affected by the fluctuations.     Because many of our European and automotive electronics    customers slow or cease operations during the summer months, we    sometimes experience weaker demand in the quarters ending in    September compared to the quarters ending in March, June and    December. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue, which    causes our quarterly results to fluctuate. If our revenue during    any quarter were to fall below the expectations of investors or    securities analysts, our share price could decline, perhaps    significantly. Unfavorable economic conditions, lower than    normal levels of demand and other occurrences in any of the    other quarters could also harm our operating results. Natural    disasters, equipment failures, work stoppages and other    unexpected events may lead our customers to curtail production    or shut down their operations.     Our customers manufacturing operations are subject to    conditions beyond their control, including raw material    shortages, natural disasters, interruptions in electrical power    or other energy services, equipment failures, work stoppages due    to strikes or lockouts, particularly those affecting the    automotive industry, one of our major markets, and other    unexpected events. Any of those events could also affect other    suppliers to our customers. In either case, those events could    cause our customers to curtail production or to shut down a    portion or all of their operations, which could reduce their    demand for our products and reduce our sales.    10Table of ContentsUnexpected    events and natural disasters at our mine could increase the cost    of operating our business.     A portion of our production costs at our mine are fixed    regardless of current operating levels. Our operating levels are    subject to conditions beyond our control that may increase the    cost of mining for varying lengths of time. These conditions    include, among other things, fire, natural disasters, pit wall    failures and ore processing changes. Our mining operations also    involve the handling and production of potentially explosive    materials. It is possible that an explosion could result in    death and injuries to employees and others and material property    damage to third parties and us. Any explosion could expose us to    adverse publicity or liability for damages and materially    adversely affect our operations. Any of these events could    increase our cost of operations. Equipment    failures and other unexpected events at our facilities may lead    to manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     The manufacturing processes that take place in our mining    operation, as well as in our manufacturing facilities, depend on    critical pieces of equipment. This equipment may, on occasion,    be out of service because of unanticipated failure, and some    equipment is not readily available or replaceable. In addition    to equipment failures, our facilities are also subject to the    risk of loss due to unanticipated events such as fires,    explosions or other disasters. Material plant shutdowns or    reductions in operations could harm our ability to fulfill our    customers demands, which could harm our sales and cause    our customers to find other suppliers. Further, remediation of    any interruption in production capability may require us to make    large capital expenditures, particularly associated with our    Metal Systems Group business which is more capital intensive,    which may have a negative effect on our profitability and cash    flows. Our business interruption insurance may not cover all of    the lost revenues associated with interruptions in our    manufacturing capabilities. Many    of our manufacturing facilities are dependent on single source    energy suppliers, and interruption in energy services may cause    manufacturing curtailments or shutdowns.     Many of our manufacturing facilities depend on one source for    electric power and for natural gas. For example, Utah Power is    the sole supplier of electric power to the processing facility    for our mining operations in Utah. A significant interruption in    service from our energy suppliers due to equipment failures,    terrorism or any other cause may result in substantial losses    that are not fully covered by our business interruption    insurance. Any substantial unmitigated interruption of our    operations due to these conditions could harm our ability to    meet our customers demands and reduce our sales. If the    price of electrical power, fuel or other energy sources    increases, our operating expenses could increase    significantly.     We have 19 milling and manufacturing facilities and a mining    operation, which depend on electrical power, fuel or other    energy sources. See    Item 2.  Properties, found on    page 14. Our operating expenses are sensitive to changes in    electricity prices and fuel prices, including natural gas    prices. Prices for electricity and natural gas have continued to    increase and can fluctuate widely with availability and demand    levels from other users. During periods of peak usage, supplies    of energy may be curtailed, and we may not be able to purchase    energy at historical market rates. While we have some long-term    contracts with energy suppliers, we are exposed to fluctuations    in energy costs that can affect our production costs. Although    we enter into forward fixed price supply contracts for natural    gas and electricity for use in our operations, those contracts    are of limited duration and do not cover all of our fuel or    electricity needs. Price increases in fuel and electricity costs    will continue to increase our cost of operations. We    have a limited number of manufacturing facilities, and damage to    those facilities could interrupt our operations, increase our    costs of doing business and impair our ability to deliver our    products on a timely basis.     Some of our facilities are interdependent. For instance, our    manufacturing facility in Elmore, Ohio relies on our mining    operation for its supply of beryllium hydroxide used in    production of most of its beryllium-containing materials.    Additionally, our Shoemakersville, Pennsylvania; Fremont,    California and Tucson, Arizona manufacturing facilities are    dependent on materials produced by our Elmore, Ohio    manufacturing facility and our    11Table of Contents    Wheatfield, New York manufacturing facility is dependent on our    Buffalo, New York manufacturing facility. See    Item 2  Properties, found on    page 14. The destruction or closure of any of our    manufacturing facilities or our mine for a significant period of    time as a result of fire, explosion, act of war or terrorism or    other natural disaster or unexpected event may interrupt our    manufacturing capabilities, increase our capital expenditures    and our costs of doing business and impair our ability to    deliver our products on a timely basis. In such an event, we may    need to resort to an alternative source of manufacturing or to    delay production, which could increase our costs of doing    business. Our property damage and business interruption    insurance may not cover all of our potential losses and may not    continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Our    lengthy and variable sales and development cycle makes it    difficult for us to predict if and when a new product will be    sold to customers.     Our sales and development cycle, which is the period from the    generation of a sales lead or new product idea through the    development of the product and the recording of sales, may    typically take up to two or three years, making it very    difficult to forecast sales and results of operations. Our    inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of    sales of our products, especially newly introduced products,    could affect our ability to meet our customers product    delivery requirements or cause our results of operations to    suffer if we incur expenses in a particular period that do not    translate into sales during that period, or at all. In addition,    these failures would make it difficult to plan future capital    expenditure needs and could cause us to fail to meet our cash    flow requirements. Future    terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may directly    harm our operations.     Future terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war may    directly impact our physical facilities. For example, our    Elmore, Ohio facility is located near and derives power from a    nuclear power plant, which could be a target for a terrorist    attack. In addition, future terrorist attacks, related armed    conflicts or prolonged or increased tensions in the Middle East    or other regions of the world could cause consumer confidence    and spending to decrease, decreasing demand for consumer goods    that contain our products. Further, when the United States armed    forces are involved in active hostilities or large-scale    deployments, defense spending tends to focus more on meeting the    physical needs of the troops, and planned expenditures on    weapons and other systems incorporating our products may be    reduced or deferred. Any of these occurrences could also    increase volatility in the United States and worldwide financial    markets, which could negatively impact our sales. We may    be unable to access the financial markets on favorable    terms.     The inability to raise capital on favorable terms, particularly    during times of uncertainty in the financial markets, could    impact our ability to sustain and grow our business and would    increase our capital costs. We rely on access to financial    markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital    requirements not satisfied by cash on hand or operating cash    flow. Our access to the financial markets could be adversely    impacted by various factors, including:           Changes in credit markets that reduce available credit or the    ability to renew existing liquidity facilities on acceptable    terms;           A deterioration of our credit;           Extreme volatility in our markets that increases margin or    credit requirements;           A material breakdown in our risk management procedures; and           The collateral pledge of substantially all of our assets in    connection with our existing indebtedness, which limits our    flexibility in raising additional capital.     All of these factors, except a material breakdown in our risk    management procedures, have adversely impacted our access to the    financial markets at various times over the last five years.    12Table of ContentsLow    investment performance by our pension plan assets may require us    to increase our pension liability and expense, which may also    lead us to accelerate funding our pension obligations and divert    funds from other potential uses.     We provide defined benefit pension plans to eligible employees.    Our pension expense and our required contributions to our    pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets,    the projected rate of return on plan assets, the actual rate of    return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to    measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including    the rate at which future obligations are discounted to a present    value, or the discount rate. For pension accounting purposes, we    assumed an 8.5% rate of return on pension assets.     Lower investment performance of our pension plan assets    resulting from a decline in the stock market could significantly    increase the deficit position of our plans. Should the assets    earn an average return less than 8.5% over time, it is likely    that future pension expenses would increase. Investment earnings    in excess of 8.5% may reduce future pension expenses. The actual    return on our plan assets for the twelve months ending    December 31, 2005 was 6.5% and the ten-year average    annualized return as of year-end 2005 was 7.8%.     We establish the discount rate used to determine the present    value of the projected and accumulated benefit obligation at the    end of each year based upon the available market rates for high    quality, fixed income investments. An increase in the discount    rate would reduce the future pension expense and, conversely, a    lower discount rate would raise the future pension expense.     Based on current guidelines, assumptions and estimates,    including stock market prices and interest rates, we anticipate    that we will be required to make a cash contribution of    approximately $1.9 million to our pension plan in 2006. If    our current assumptions and estimates are not correct, a    contribution in years beyond 2006 may be greater than the    projected 2006 contribution required.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our pension expenses or funding obligations, diverting    funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. Our    expenditures for post-retirement health benefits could be    materially higher than we have predicted if our underlying    assumptions prove to be incorrect.     We also provide post-retirement health benefits to eligible    employees. Our retiree health expense is directly affected by    the assumptions we use to measure our retiree health plan    obligations, including the assumed rate at which health care    costs will increase and the discount rate used to calculate    future obligations. For retiree health accounting purposes, we    decreased the assumed rate at which health care costs will    increase for the next year to 9% at December 31, 2005 from    10% at December 31, 2004. In addition, we have assumed that    this health care cost increase trend rate will decline to 5% by    2010. We have used the same discount rates for our retiree    health plans that we use for our pension plan accounting.     Assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect    on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A 1.0%    increase in assumed health care cost trend rates would have    increased the post-employment benefits included among the    liabilities in our balance sheet by $1.0 million at    December 31, 2005.     We cannot predict whether changing market or economic    conditions, regulatory changes or other factors will further    increase our retiree health care expenses or obligations,    diverting funds we would otherwise apply to other uses. We are    subject to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, which may    negatively affect our financial performance.     A significant portion of our sales is conducted in international    markets and priced in currencies other than the United States    dollar. Revenues from customers outside of the United States    (principally Europe and Asia) amount to 33%, 33% and 31% for the    years 2005, 2004 and 2003,  respectively. A significant part of    these international sales are priced in currencies other than    the U.S. dollar. Significant fluctuations in currency    values relative to the United    13Table of Contents    States dollar may negatively affect our financial performance.    While we may hedge our currency transactions to mitigate the    impact of currency price volatility on our earnings, any hedging    activities may not be successful. Our    holding company structure causes us to rely on funds from our    subsidiaries.     We are a holding company and conduct substantially all our    operations through our subsidiaries. As a holding company, we    are dependent upon dividends or other intercompany transfers of    funds from our subsidiaries. The payment of dividends and other    payments to us by our subsidiaries may be restricted by, among    other things, applicable corporate and other laws and    regulations, agreements of the subsidiaries and the terms of our    current and future indebtedness. "
