16,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2024-02-12,"ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONWhile we have reached the Agreement in Principle with the EPA, CARB, DOJ and CA AG to resolve certain regulatory civil claims regarding our emissions certification and compliance process for certain engines primarily used in pick-up truck applications in the U.S. and recorded a charge of $2.036 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 in connection with the Agreement in Principle, the Agreement in Principle remains subject to final regulatory and judicial approvals. In addition, we have incurred, and likely will incur, other additional claims, costs and expenses in connection with the matters covered by the Agreement in Principle and other matters related to our compliance with emission standards for our engines, including with respect to additional regulatory action and collateral litigation related to these matters. Those and related expenses and reputational damage could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In December 2023, we announced that we reached the Agreement in Principle and recorded a charge of $2.036 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023 to resolve the matters addressed by the Agreement in Principle involving approximately one million of our pick-up truck applications in the U.S. This charge was in addition to the previously announced charges of $59 million for the recalls of model years 2013 through 2018 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks and model years 2016 through 2019 Titan trucks. Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement in Principle will also subject us to further stipulated penalties. The Agreement in Principle remains subject to final regulatory and judicial approvals, and we cannot be certain that the Agreement in Principle will be approved, in its current form, or at all.  We have also been in communication with other non-U.S. regulators regarding matters related to the emission systems in our engines and may also become subject to additional regulatory review in connection with these matters.In connection with our announcement of our entry into the Agreement in Principle, we have become subject to shareholder, consumer and third-party litigation regarding the matters covered by the Agreement in Principle and we may become subject to additional litigation in connection with these matters. The consequences resulting from the resolution of the foregoing matters are uncertain and the related expenses and reputational damage could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See NOTE 15, ""COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES,"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and, along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent and fragmented emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. Regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny. In addition, failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the Agreement in Principle will subject us to stipulated penalties. The discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive position in the engine applications and industries we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could 18Table of Contentsresult in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Evolving environmental and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives may adversely impact our operations, could impact the competitive landscape within our markets and could negatively affect demand for our products. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, carbon content, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. For example, in October 2023, the EPA published a final rule imposing reporting and recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers and importers of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material. We may become subject to additional evolving regulations related to the cleanup of contaminated property, such as the EPA's proposal to designate two widely used PFAS as hazardous substances.Concern over climate change has resulted in, and could continue to result in, new legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG emissions. We may become subject to further additional legislation, regulations or accords regarding climate change, and compliance with new rules could be difficult and costly, including increased capital expenditures. Our failure to successfully comply with any such legislation, regulation or accord could also impact our ability to compete in our markets and decrease demand for our products.We operate our business on a global basis and changes in international, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies affecting and/or restricting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.  We manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products. Changes in laws, regulations and government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, cause non-U.S. customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S. trade relationship with China, Brazil and France and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs (including, but not limited to, additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries, including based on developments in U.S. and China relations), import or export licensing requirements and exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could limit our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets, impair our ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services, and could adversely impact our production costs, customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Embargoes, sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities, including financial institutions, to certain countries or regions, or involving certain products, limit the sales of our products. Embargoes, sanctions and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to China. In particular, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties, could affect our ability to collect receivables, access cash generated in China, provide aftermarket and warranty support for our products, sell products and otherwise impact our reputation and business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by the adoption of new tax legislation, changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or 19Table of Contentssubsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term.In an effort to limit GHG emissions and combat climate change, multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their countries or cities of diesel-powered products in the near or distant future. These countries include China, India and Germany. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of certain diesel-powered vehicles by 2035. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our diesel business over the long-term could experience material adverse impacts.BUSINESS CONDITIONS / DISRUPTIONSWe may fail to successfully integrate the acquisition of Meritor and / or fail to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits, including enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flow from our acquisition which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The acquisition of Meritor involves the integration of Meritorâs operations with our existing operations, and there are uncertainties inherent in such an integration. We have, and will be continued to be required to, devote significant management attention and resources to integrating Meritorâs operations. Our ability to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits, including enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flow, from our acquisition of Meritor will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully integrate the products into our segments, launch the Meritor products around the world and achieve our projected sales goals. While we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve some or all of these objectives within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. If we are not able to successfully complete the integration of the Meritor business or implement our Meritor strategy, we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits, including enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flows, from this acquisition or such anticipated benefits may take longer to realize than expected. As part of the purchase accounting associated with the acquisition, significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. If cash flows from the acquisition fall short of our anticipated amounts, these assets could be subject to non-cash impairment charges, negatively impacting our earnings. Failure to successfully integrate Meritor and / or realize the anticipated benefits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are vulnerable to raw material, transportation and labor price fluctuations and supply shortages, which impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  We are experiencing supply chain disruptions and related challenges throughout the supply chain. We single source a number of parts and raw materials critical to our business operations. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers (including, but not limited to, raw material availability, capacity constraints, port congestion, labor disputes or unrest, shortages of labor, economic downturns, availability of credit, impaired financial condition, sanctions/tariffs, pandemic restrictions, energy inflation/availability, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters, acts of government or acts of war or terrorism). The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability may exacerbate these risks. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In addition, the current economic environment has resulted, and may continue to result, in price volatility and increased levels of inflation of many of our raw material, transportation and other costs. In particular, increased levels of inflation, rising interest rates and 20Table of Contentsconcerns regarding a potential economic recession may result in increased operating costs and/or decreased levels of profitability. Further, the labor market for skilled manufacturing remains tight, and our labor costs have increased as a result. Material, transportation, labor and other cost inflation has impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.Our markets are cyclical in nature and we face periods when demand fluctuates significantly higher or lower than our normal operating levels, including variability driven by supply chain inconsistency. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity are important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows. We manage our capacity by adjusting our manufacturing workforce, capital expenditures and purchases from suppliers. In periods of weak demand, we may face under-utilized capacity and un-recovered overhead costs, while in periods of strong demand we may experience unplanned costs and could fail to meet customer demand. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately adjust our manufacturing capacity in response to significant changes in customer demand, which could harm our business. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees. For 2023, we recognized $483 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $349 million in 2022. Approximately one third of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. Although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers discontinuing outsourcing their engine supply needs, experiencing financial distress or experiencing a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. Many are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers, financial distress of one of our large truck OEM customers due to a change-in-control, could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGYOur products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to reputational risk, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues. Any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See NOTE 14, ""PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world as well as elevated levels of inflation may offset our 21Table of Contentsefforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks, there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. While the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments, we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, could result in declining margins.The development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services. We are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, hydrogen production and fuel cells, for planned introduction into certain new and existing markets. Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to our planned products, which will face competition from an array of other technologies and manufacturers.Â The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified or alternate fuel powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims.We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.GENERALWe may not realize the anticipated value or tax treatment for the anticipated full divestiture of our interest in Atmus Filtration Technologies Inc. (Atmus).There are uncertainties and risks related to the timing and potential value to Cummins, Atmus and our respective shareholders of the planned divestiture of Atmus, including business, industry and market risks, as well as risks involving realizing the anticipated favorable tax treatment of the divestiture if there is a significant delay or failure to complete the divestiture. Failure to implement the divestiture effectively could result in a lower value to Cummins, Atmus and our respective shareholders.A delay or failure to complete the divestiture could result in our businesses facing material challenges in connection with this transaction, including, without limitation:â¢the diversion of managementâs attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on our businesses as a result of the devotion of managementâs attention to strategic alternatives for the Atmus divestiture;â¢maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;â¢retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships; and 22Table of Contentsâ¢foreseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses.Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on each of Cummins' and Atmus's respective business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the divestiture is completed, the new independent company will incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as an independent company, that the divested business will no longer be able to share.We may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent climate change regulations, accords, mitigation efforts, GHG regulations or other legislation designed to address climate change. The scientific consensus indicates that emissions of GHG continue to alter the composition of Earthâs atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The potential impacts of climate change on our customers, product offerings, operations, facilities and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain, as they will be particular to local and customer-specific circumstances. These potential impacts may include, among other items, physical long-term changes in freshwater availability and the frequency and severity of weather events as well as customer product changes either through preference or regulation. Concerns regarding climate change may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses, accords and mitigation efforts. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions, and consumers are increasingly demanding products and services resulting in lower GHG emissions. We could face risks to our brand reputation, investor confidence and market share due to an inability to innovate and develop new products that decrease GHG emissions. Increased input costs, such as fuel, utility, transportation and compliance-related costs could increase our operating costs and negatively impact customer operations and demand for our products. As the impact of any additional future climate related legislative or regulatory requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing, scope and design of the mandates or standards, we are currently unable to predict its potential impact which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Climate change may exacerbate the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions, which may cause disruptions to our operations, including disrupting manufacturing, distribution and our supply chain.Our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks. Part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth, gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.Our business and operations are subject to interest rate risks and changes in interest rates can reduce demand for our products and increase borrowing costs and result in non-cash chargesRising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and our customersâ ability to repay obligations to us. Rising interest rates may increase our cost of capital which could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and cash 23Table of Contentsflows. Rising interest rates could also impact certain goodwill assets requiring non-cash impairment charges which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings.We operate in challenging markets for talent and may fail to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We depend on the skills, institutional knowledge, working relationships, and continued services and contributions of key personnel, including our leadership team and others at all levels of the company, as a critical part of our human capital resources. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating and strategic goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel in a highly competitive labor market, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our information technology environment and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology environment and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these technologies and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new technologies, they may not perform as expected. We face the challenge of supporting our older technologies and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these technologies are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important technology, including during upgrades and/or new implementations of technologies, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The data handled by our technologies is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. As such, our information technology environment faces information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware, ransomware attacks and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, along with power outages or hardware failures. These threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information, create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, disrupt our ability to conduct our business, result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. As the result of changing market conditions, a large percentage of our salaried employees continue to work remotely full or part-time. This remote working environment may pose a heightened risk for security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology environment. In addition, our products, including our engines, contain interconnected and increasingly complex technologies that control various processes and these technologies are potentially subject to ""cyber attacks"" and disruption. The impact of a significant information technology event on either our information technology environment or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of our competition, customer base and product offerings and impact our growth globally. Our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:â¢public health crises, including the spread of a contagious disease, such as future pandemics or epidemics, quarantines or shutdowns related to public health crises, and other catastrophic events;â¢economic and political instability, including international conflicts, war, acts of terrorism or the threat thereof, political or labor unrest, civil unrest, riots or insurrections;â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and24Table of Contentsâ¢changes in general economic and political conditions, including changes in relationship with the U.S., in countries where we operate, particularly in China and emerging markets.As we continue to operate and grow our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the future relationships between the U.S. and China, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, especially trade with China could adversely impact our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We face significant competition in the regions we serve.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, hydrogen, electrification and other technologies, and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging regions who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. Additionally, we face increasing competition to develop innovative products that result in lower emissions. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.Failure to meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) expectations or standards, or to achieve our ESG goals, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on ESG matters, including GHG emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights and social responsibility. Given our commitment to certain ESG principles, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments and targets which we may refine, or even expand further, in the future. These goals, commitments and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation.Such risks and uncertainties include:â¢reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments or other stakeholders;â¢adverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products;â¢the success of our collaborations with third parties;â¢increased risk of litigation, investigations or regulatory enforcement actions;â¢unfavorable ESG ratings or investor sentiment;â¢diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics;â¢our ability to achieve our goals, commitments and targets within the timeframes announced;â¢access to and increased cost of capital andâ¢adverse impacts on our stock price.25Table of ContentsAny failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our ESG goals, commitments and targets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.At December 31, 2023, we employed approximately 75,500 persons worldwide. Approximately 21,900 of our employees worldwide were represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2024 and 2028. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us, our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in current and future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity and length of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case"
11,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2023-02-14,"ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONWe are conducting a formal internal review of our emission certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to our pick-up truck applications and are working with the EPA and CARB to address their questions about these applications. Due to the continuing nature of our formal internal review and on-going discussions with the EPA and CARB, we cannot predict the final results of this formal review and these regulatory processes, nor whether, or the extent to which, they could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. We previously announced that we are conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to all of our pick-up truck applications, following conversations with the EPA and CARB regarding certification of our engines for model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks. During conversations with the EPA and CARB about the effectiveness of our pick-up truck applications, the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices. As a result, our internal review focuses, in part, on the regulatorsâ concerns. We are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pick-up truck applications and to fully address the regulatorsâ requirements. Based on discussions with the regulators, we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since September 2019. During our ongoing discussions, the regulators turned their attention to other model years and other engines, most notably our pick-up truck applications for RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks for model years 2013 through 2018 and Titan trucks for model years 2016 through 2019. We have also been in communication with Environmental and Climate Change Canada regarding similar issues relating to some of these very same platforms. In connection with these and other ongoing discussions with the EPA and CARB, we are developing a new software calibration and will recall model years 2013 through 2018 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks. We accrued $30 million for the RAM recall during the first quarter of 2022, an amount that reflected our current estimate of the cost of that recall. We are also developing a new software calibration and hardware fix and will recall model years 2016 through 2019 Titan trucks. We accrued $29 million for the Titan recall during the third quarter of 2022, an amount that reflected our current estimate of the cost of that recall.We will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement and seek to reach further resolutions as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance. Due to the presence of many unknown facts and circumstances, we are not yet able to estimate any further financial impact of these matters. It is possible that the consequences resulting from our formal review and these regulatory processes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and, along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent and fragmented emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. Regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny. The discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive position in the engine applications and industries we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.19Table of ContentsIn addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We operate our business on a global basis and changes in international, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies affecting and/or restricting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.  We manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products. Changes in laws, regulations and government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, cause non-U.S. customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S. trade relationship with China, Brazil and France and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs (including, but not limited to, additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries, including based on developments in U.S. and China relations), import or export licensing requirements and exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could limit our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets, impair our ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services, and could adversely impact our production costs, customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Embargoes, sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities, including financial institutions, to certain countries or regions, or involving certain products, limit the sales of our products. Embargoes, sanctions and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to China. In particular, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties, could affect our ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket and warranty support for our products, sell products and otherwise impact our reputation and business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by the adoption of new tax legislation, changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.20Table of ContentsEvolving environmental and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives may adversely impact our operations, could impact the competitive landscape within our markets and could negatively affect demand for our products. Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.Concern over climate change has resulted in, and could continue to result in, new legal or regulatory requirements designed to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We may become subject to additional legislation, regulations or accords regarding climate change, and compliance with any new rules could be difficult and costly, including increased capital expenditures. Our failure to successfully comply with any such legislation, regulation or accord could also impact our ability to compete in our markets and decrease demand for our products.Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term.In an effort to limit GHG emissions and combat climate change, multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their countries or cities of diesel-powered products in the near or distant future. These countries include China, India and Germany. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of certain diesel-powered vehicles by 2035. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our diesel business over the long-term could experience material adverse impacts.BUSINESS CONDITIONS / DISRUPTIONSWe may fail to successfully integrate the acquisition of Meritor and / or fail to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits, including enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flow from our acquisition which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The acquisition of Meritor will involve the integration of Meritorâs operations with our existing operations, and there are uncertainties inherent in such an integration. We will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating Meritorâs operations. Our ability to fully realize all of the anticipated benefits, including enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flow, from our acquisition of Meritor will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully integrate the products into our segments, launch the Meritor products around the world and achieve our projected sales goals. While we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve some or all of these objectives within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. If we are not able to successfully complete the integration of the Meritor business or implement our Meritor strategy, we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits, including enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flows, from this acquisition or such anticipated benefits may take longer to realize than expected. As part of the purchase accounting associated with the acquisition, significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. If cash flows from the acquisition fall short of our anticipated amounts, these assets could be subject to non-cash impairment charges, negatively impacting our earnings. Failure to successfully integrate Meritor and / or realize the anticipated benefits could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are vulnerable to raw material, transportation and labor price fluctuations and supply shortages, which impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  We are experiencing supply chain disruptions and related challenges throughout the supply chain. We single source a number of parts and raw materials critical to our business operations. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers (including, but not limited to, raw material availability, capacity constraints, port congestion, labor disputes or unrest, shortages of labor, economic downturns, availability of credit, impaired financial condition, sanctions/tariffs, pandemic restrictions, energy inflation/availability, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters, acts of government or acts of war or terrorism). The effects of climate change, including extreme weather events, long-term changes in temperature levels and water availability may exacerbate these risks. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.21Table of ContentsIn addition, the current economic environment has resulted, and may continue to result, in price volatility and increased levels of inflation of many of our raw material, transportation and other costs. In particular, increased levels of inflation, rising interest rates and concerns regarding a potential economic recession may result in increased operating costs and/or decreased levels of profitability. Further, the labor market for skilled manufacturing remains tight, and our labor costs have increased as a result. Material, transportation, labor and other cost inflation has impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the global response (including government bans or restrictions on doing business in Russia), could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Given the nature of our business and our global operations, political, economic, and other conditions in foreign countries and regions, including geopolitical risks such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We suspended our commercial operations in Russia indefinitely, which resulted in a charge of $111Â million during 2022 related to these actions. As of December 31, 2022, we had no inventory and approximately $14 million of receivables in Russia, all of which are fully reserved. In addition, we have cash balances of $66Â million, some of which will be used to fund ongoing employee, tax and contract settlement obligations. We may incur additional charges as conditions continue to evolve including with respect to our planned extrication from our relationship with KAMAZ Publicly Traded Company and its subsidiaries, including the unconsolidated joint venture. In addition, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, an inability to collect customer receivables and may be the subject of litigation in connection with our suspension of commercial operations in Russia. The broader consequences of this conflict, which may include further sanctions, embargoes, regional instability, and geopolitical shifts; potential retaliatory action by the Russian government against companies, including possible nationalization of foreign businesses in Russia; increased tensions between the United States and countries in which we operate; and the extent of the conflictâs effect on our business and results of operations as well as the global economy, cannot be predicted. To the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine adversely affects our business, it may also have the effect of heightening many other risks, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, particularly with regard to raw material, transportation and labor price fluctuations; disruptions to our information technology environment, including through cyberattack, ransom attack, or cyber-intrusion; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; disruptions in global supply chains; and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate changes.We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.Our markets are cyclical in nature and we face periods when demand fluctuates significantly higher or lower than our normal operating levels, including variability driven by supply chain inconsistency. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity are important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows. We manage our capacity by adjusting our manufacturing workforce, capital expenditures and purchases from suppliers. In periods of weak demand, we may face under-utilized capacity and un-recovered overhead costs, while in periods of strong demand we may experience unplanned costs and could fail to meet customer demand. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately adjust our manufacturing capacity in response to significant changes in customer demand, which could harm our business. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees. For 2022, we recognized $349 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $506 million in 2021. Approximately one third of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. Although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers discontinuing outsourcing their engine supply needs, experiencing financial distress or experiencing a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. Many are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems 22Table of Contentsintegration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers, financial distress of one of our large truck OEM customers due to a change-in-control, could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGYOur products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to reputational risk, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues. Any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See NOTE 14, ""PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world as well as elevated levels of inflation may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks, there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. While the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments, we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, could result in declining margins.The development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services. We are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, hydrogen production and fuel cells, for planned introduction into certain new and existing markets. Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to our planned products, which will face competition from an array of other technologies and manufacturers.Â The ongoing energy transition away from fossil fuels and the increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified or alternate fuel powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims.We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain 23Table of Contentsinsurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.GENERALWe may not complete the separation of our filtration business within the time frame we anticipate or at all. The separation may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us and/or the independent business resulting from the separation and/or costs associated with the separation may be higher than anticipated. Additionally, if we complete the separation, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separation.In August 2021, we announced our exploration of strategic alternatives for our filtration business unit, including the potential separation of the business into a stand-alone company (the âseparationâ). Any separation would be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete the separation, within the anticipated time frame or at all. Whether or not the separation is completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with this transaction, including, without limitation:â¢the diversion of managementâs attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on our businesses as a result of the devotion of managementâs attention to strategic alternatives for the filtration business, including the separation;â¢maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;â¢retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships;â¢execution and related risks in connection with financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation;â¢foreseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses; andâ¢any potential negative reactions from the financial markets resulting from the separation.Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the separation is completed, the new independent company will incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as an independent company, that the separated business will no longer be able to share. Those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation.Our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks. Part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth, gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.24Table of ContentsSimilarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.Our business and operations are subject to interest rate risks and changes in interest rates can reduce demand for our products and increase borrowing costs.Rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity and/or the financial condition of our customers, either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for our products and our customersâ ability to repay obligations to us. Rising interest rates may increase our cost of capital which could have material adverse effects on our financial condition and cash flows. We operate in challenging markets for talent and may fail to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We depend on the skills, institutional knowledge, working relationships, and continued services and contributions of key personnel, including our leadership team and others at all levels of the company, as a critical part of our human capital resources. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating and strategic goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel in a highly competitive labor market, and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent climate change regulations, accords, mitigation efforts, GHG regulations or other legislation designed to address climate change.The scientific consensus indicates that emissions of GHG continue to alter the composition of Earthâs atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The potential impacts of climate change on our customers, product offerings, operations, facilities and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain, as they will be particular to local and customer-specific circumstances. These potential impacts may include, among other items, physical long-term changes in freshwater availability and the frequency and severity of weather events as well as customer product changes either through preference or regulation. Concerns regarding climate change may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses, accords and mitigation efforts. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions, and consumers are increasingly demanding products and services resulting in lower GHG emissions. We could face risks to our brand reputation, investor confidence and market share due to an inability to innovate and develop new products that decrease GHG emissions. Increased input costs, such as fuel, utility, transportation and compliance-related costs could increase our operating costs and negatively impact customer operations and demand for our products. As the impact of any future climate related legislative or regulatory requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing, scope and design of the mandates or standards, we are currently unable to predict its potential impact which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Climate change may exacerbate the frequency and intensity of natural disasters and adverse weather conditions, which may cause disruptions to our operations, including disrupting manufacturing, distribution and our supply chain.Our information technology environment and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology environment and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these technologies and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new technologies, they may not perform as expected. We face the challenge of supporting our older technologies and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these technologies are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important technology, including during upgrades and/or new implementations of technologies, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The data handled by our technologies is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. While we continually work to safeguard our information technology environment and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to prevent information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware, ransomware attacks and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, along with power outages or hardware failures. These threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information, create financial liability, subject us to 25Table of Contentslegal or regulatory sanctions, disrupt our ability to conduct our business, result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. As the result of changing market conditions, a large percentage of our salaried employees continue to work remotely full or part-time. This remote working environment may pose a heightened risk for security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology environment. In addition, our products, including our engines, contain interconnected and increasingly complex technologies that control various processes and these technologies are potentially subject to ""cyber attacks"" and disruption. The impact of a significant information technology event on either our information technology environment or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of our competition, customer base and product offerings and impact our growth globally. Our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:â¢public health crises, including the spread of a contagious disease, such as future pandemics or epidemics, quarantines or shutdowns related to public health crises, and other catastrophic events;â¢economic and political instability, including international conflicts, war, acts of terrorism or the threat thereof, political or labor unrest, civil unrest, riots or insurrections;â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; andâ¢changes in general economic and political conditions, including changes in relationship with the U.S., in countries where we operate, particularly in China and emerging markets.As we continue to operate and grow our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the future relationships between the U.S. and China, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, especially trade with China could adversely impact our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We face significant competition in the regions we serve.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, hydrogen, electrification and other technologies, and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging regions who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. Additionally, we face increasing competition to develop innovative products that result in lower emissions. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could 26Table of Contentsadversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.Failure to meet environmental, social and governance (ESG) expectations or standards, or to achieve our ESG goals, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.In recent years, there has been an increased focus from stakeholders on ESG matters, including GHG emissions and climate-related risks, renewable energy, water stewardship, waste management, diversity, equity and inclusion, responsible sourcing and supply chain, human rights and social responsibility. Given our commitment to certain ESG principles, we actively manage these issues and have established and publicly announced certain goals, commitments and targets which we may refine, or even expand further, in the future. These goals, commitments and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts to manage these issues, report on them and accomplish our goals present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material adverse impact, including on our reputation.Such risks and uncertainties include:â¢reputational harm, including damage to our relationships with customers, suppliers, investors, governments or other stakeholders;â¢adverse impacts on our ability to sell and manufacture products;â¢the success of our collaborations with third parties;â¢increased risk of litigation, investigations or regulatory enforcement action;â¢unfavorable ESG ratings or investor sentiment;â¢diversion of resources and increased costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics;â¢our ability to achieve our goals, commitments and targets within the timeframes announced;â¢access to and increased cost of capital andâ¢adverse impacts on our stock price.Any failure, or perceived failure, to meet evolving stakeholder expectations and industry standards or achieve our ESG goals, commitments and targets could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.At December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 73,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 23,400 of our employees worldwide were represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2023 and 2027. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us, our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.27Table of ContentsSignificant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in current and future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity and length of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case"
9,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2022-02-08,"ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONWe are conducting a formal internal review of our emission certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to our pick-up truck applications and are working with the EPA and CARB to address their questions about these applications. Due to the continuing nature of our formal internal review and on-going discussions with the EPA and CARB, we cannot predict the final results of this formal review and these regulatory processes, nor whether, or the extent to which, they could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.We previously announced that we are conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to all of our pick-up truck applications, following conversations with the EPA and CARB regarding certification of our engines for model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks. During conversations with the EPA and CARB about the effectiveness of our pick-up truck applications, the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices. As a result, our internal review focuses, in part, on the regulatorsâ concerns. We are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pick-up truck applications and to fully address the regulatorsâ requirements. Based on discussions with the regulators, we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since September 2019. During our discussions, the regulators turned their attention to other model years and other engines, most notably our pick-up truck applications for RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks for model years 2013 through 2018. We will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance. Due to the continuing nature of the formal review, our ongoing cooperation with the regulators and the presence of many unknown facts and circumstances, we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters. It is possible that the consequences of any remediation plans resulting from our formal review and these regulatory processes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and, along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent and fragmented emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. Regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny. The discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive position in the engine applications and industries we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.18Table of ContentsWe operate our business on a global basis and changes in international, national and regional trade laws, regulations and policies affecting and/or restricting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position. We manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products. Changes in laws, regulations and government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, cause non-U.S. customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S. trade relationship with China, Brazil and France and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs (including, but not limited to, additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries, including based on developments in U.S., China and Russia relations), import or export licensing requirements and exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could limit our ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets, impair our ability to expand the business by offering new technologies, products and services, and could adversely impact our production costs, customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Embargoes, sanctions and export controls imposed by the U.S. and other governments restricting or prohibiting transactions with certain persons or entities, including financial institutions, to certain countries or regions, or involving certain products, limit the sales of our products. Embargoes, sanctions and export control laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to China and Russia. In particular, changing U.S. export controls and sanctions on China, as well as other restrictions affecting transactions involving China and Chinese parties and Russian and Russian parties, could affect our ability to collect receivables, provide aftermarket and warranty support for our products, sell products and otherwise impact our reputation and business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The U.S. governmentâs pending rules and regulations concerning mandatory COVID-19 vaccination of U.S.-based employees of companies that work on or in support of federal contracts could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order requiring all employers with U.S. government contracts to ensure that their U.S.-based employees, contractors and subcontractors, that work on or in support of U.S. government contracts, are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as required by the executive order. The executive order includes on-site and remote U.S.-based employees, contractors and subcontractors and provides for limited medical and religious exceptions. As of December 2021, the executive order has been put on hold by numerous federal courts, pending a final outcome by one or more federal appellate courts and possibly the U.S. Supreme Court. In the meantime, we continue to track the status of our federal contracts and otherwise prepare for the possible implementation of the order.It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact the executive order will have on our workforce if it survives the legal challenges. Additional vaccine mandates may be announced in jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Our implementation of these requirements may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by the adoption of new tax legislation, changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-19Table of Contentscorruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term.In an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their countries or cities of diesel-powered products in the near or distant future. These countries include China, India and Germany. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of certain diesel-powered vehicles by 2035. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our diesel business over the long-term could experience material adverse impacts.BUSINESS CONDITIONS / DISRUPTIONSWe are vulnerable to raw material, transportation and labor price fluctuations and supply shortages, which impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  We are experiencing supply chain disruptions and related challenges throughout the supply chain. We single source a significant number of parts and raw materials critical to our business operations. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers (including the COVID-19 pandemic, capacity constraints, port congestion, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit or impaired financial condition), suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters, acts of government or acts of war or terrorism. In particular, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and results in extended periods of travel, commercial and other restrictions, we could continue to incur global supply disruptions. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In addition, the current economic environment has resulted, and may continue to result, in price volatility and inflation of many of our raw material, transportation and other costs. Further, the labor market for skilled manufacturing remains tight as the U.S. economy recovers after the COVID-19 pandemic shutdowns, and our labor costs have increased as a result. Material, transportation, labor and other cost inflation has impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.Our markets are cyclical in nature and we face periods when demand fluctuates significantly higher or lower than our normal operating levels, including variability driven by supply chain inconsistency. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity are important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows. We manage our capacity by adjusting our manufacturing workforce, capital expenditures and purchases from suppliers. In periods of weak demand we may face under-utilized capacity and un-recovered overhead costs, while in periods of strong demand we may experience unplanned costs and could fail to meet customer demand. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately adjust our manufacturing capacity in response to significant changes in customer demand, which could harm our business. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.20Table of ContentsWe derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees. For 2021, we recognized $506 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $452 million in 2020. Approximately half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. Although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers discontinuing outsourcing their engine supply needs, financial distress, particularly related to bankruptcy or a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. Many are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers, financial distress of one of our large truck OEM customers due to bankruptcy or a change-in-control, could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGYOur products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to reputational risk, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues. Any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 13, ""PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments, we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.The development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services. We are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, hydrogen production and fuel cells, for planned introduction into certain new and existing markets. Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to our planned products, which will face competition from an array of other technologies and manufacturers.Â The increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified or alternate fuel powertrains and some of our existing customers 21Table of Contentscould choose to develop their own, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims.We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.GENERALWe may not complete the separation of our filtration business within the time frame we anticipate or at all. The separation may present difficulties that could have an adverse effect on us and/or the independent business resulting from the separation and/or costs associated with the separation may be higher than anticipated. Additionally, if we complete the separation, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separation.In August 2021, we announced our exploration of strategic alternatives for our filtration business unit, including the potential separation of the business into a stand-alone company (the âseparationâ). Any separation would be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment and market conditions or regulatory or political conditions may affect our ability to complete the separation, within the anticipated time frame or at all. Whether or not the separation is completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with this transaction, including, without limitation:â¢the diversion of managementâs attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on our businesses as a result of the devotion of managementâs attention to strategic alternatives for the filtration business, including the separation;â¢maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees;â¢retaining existing business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships;â¢execution and related risks in connection with financing transactions undertaken in connection with the separation;â¢foreseen and unforeseen dis-synergy costs, costs of restructuring transactions (including taxes) and other significant costs and expenses; andâ¢any potential negative reactions from the financial markets resulting from the separation.Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if the separation is completed, the new independent company will incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as an independent company, that the separated business will no longer be able to share. Those costs may exceed our estimates or could diminish the benefits we expect to realize from the separation.22Table of ContentsOur plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks. Part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth, gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.We operate in challenging markets for talent and may fail to attract, develop and retain key personnel. We depend on the skills, institutional knowledge, working relationships, and continued services and contributions of key personnel, including our leadership team and others at all levels of the company, as a critical part of our human capital resources. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating and strategic goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas regulations designed to address climate change. The scientific consensus indicates that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earthâs atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The potential impacts of climate change on our customers, product offerings, operations, facilities and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain, as they will be particular to local and customer-specific circumstances. These potential impacts may include, among other items, physical long-term changes in freshwater availability and the frequency and severity of weather events as well as customer product changes either through preference or regulation. Concerns regarding climate change may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. We could face risks to our brand reputation, investor confidence and market share due to an inability to innovate and develop new products that decrease GHG emissions. Increased input costs, such as fuel, utility, transportation and compliance-related costs could increase our operating costs and negatively impact customer operations and demand for our products. As the impact of any future GHG legislative or regulatory requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing, scope and design of the mandates or standards, we are currently unable to predict its potential impact which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our information technology environment and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology environment and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these technologies and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new technologies, they may not perform as expected. We face the challenge of supporting our older technologies and implementing necessary upgrades. In 23Table of Contentsaddition, some of these technologies are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important technology, including during upgrades and/or new implementations of technologies, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The data handled by our technologies is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. While we continually work to safeguard our information technology environment and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to prevent information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware, ransomware attacks and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, along with power outages or hardware failures. These threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information, create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, disrupt our ability to conduct our business, result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic a large percentage of our salaried employees continue to work remotely full or part-time. This remote working environment may pose a heightened risk for security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology environment. In addition, our products, including our engines, contain interconnected and increasingly complex technologies that control various processes and these technologies are potentially subject to ""cyber attacks"" and disruption. The impact of a significant information technology event on either our information technology environment or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Greater political, economic and social uncertainty and the evolving globalization of businesses could significantly change the dynamics of our competition, customer base and product offerings and impact our growth globally. Our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:â¢public health crises, including the spread of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, and other catastrophic events;â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; andâ¢changes in general economic and political conditions, including changes in relationship with the U.S., in countries where we operate, particularly in China, Russia and emerging markets.As we continue to operate and grow our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty about the future relationships between the U.S. and China and the U.S. and Russia, including with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs. Any increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, especially trade with China or Russia, could adversely impact our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We face significant competition in the regions we serve.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, hydrogen, electrification and other technologies, and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging regions who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these 24Table of Contentsmarkets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.At December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 59,900 persons worldwide. Approximately 21,200 of our employees worldwide were represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2022 and 2026. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us, our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in current and future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity and length of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy 25Table of Contentscapacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case"
1,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2021-02-10,"ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONWe are conducting a formal internal review of our emission certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to our pick-up truck applications and are working with the EPA and CARB to address their questions about these applications. The results of this formal review and regulatory processes, or the discovery of any noncompliance issues, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.We previously announced that we are conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to all of our pick-up truck applications, following conversations with the EPA and CARB regarding certification of our engines for model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks. During conversations with the EPA and CARB about the effectiveness of our pick-up truck applications, the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices. As a result, our internal review focuses, in part, on the regulatorsâ concerns. We are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pick-up truck applications and to fully address the regulatorsâ requirements. Based on discussions with the regulators, we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since September 2019. During our discussions, the regulators have asked us to look at other model years and other engines. We will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance. Due to the continuing nature of the formal review, our ongoing cooperation with the regulators and the presence of many unknown facts and circumstances, we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters. It is possible that the consequences of any remediation plans resulting from our formal review and these regulatory processes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the periods in which these emissions certification issues are addressed. Our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and, along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent and fragmented emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. Regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny. The discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive position in the engine applications and industries we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.17Table of ContentsWe operate our business on a global basis and policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.We manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products. Changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, cause non-U.S. customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S. trade relationship with China, Brazil and France and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs (including, but not limited to, additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum), import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could adversely impact our production costs, customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The U.K.âs exit from the European Union (EU) could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.On January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited from the EU (BREXIT). Additionally, the results of the U.K.âs BREXIT caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the U.K.âs future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be higher tariffs or greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and the EU and increased regulatory complexities. The effects of BREXIT will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or on a permanent basis. These measures could potentially disrupt our supply chain, including delays of imports and exports, limited access to human capital within some of the target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate and adverse changes to tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, BREXIT could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to emissions and similar certifications granted to us by the EU, as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of BREXIT, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, 18Table of Contentstransportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term.In an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their countries or cities of diesel-powered products in the near or distant future. These countries include China, India and Germany. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of diesel-powered certain vehicles by 2035. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our diesel business over the long-term could experience material adverse impacts.BUSINESS CONDITIONS / DISRUPTIONSWe are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers, including suppliers that may be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and any delay in receiving critical supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We single source a significant number of parts and raw materials critical to our business operations. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers (including the COVID-19 pandemic, capacity constraints, port congestion, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit or impaired financial condition), suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters, acts of government or acts of war or terrorism. In particular, if the COVID-19 pandemic continues and results in extended periods of travel, commercial and other restrictions, we could continue to incur global supply disruptions. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A sustained market slowdown due to the impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, other public health crises, epidemics or pandemics or otherwise, could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally and these challenging market conditions could continue for an extended period of time. Most global economies slowed and there is still much uncertainty as to when these global markets will fully recover. If any or all of these major markets were to endure a sustained slowdown or recession due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, other public health crises, epidemics or pandemics or otherwise decline, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our manufacturing and supply chain abilities may be materially and adversely impacted by an extended shutdown or disruption of our operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The outbreak of COVID-19 spread throughout the world and became a global pandemic with the resultant economic impacts evolving into a worldwide recession. The pandemic triggered a significant downturn in our markets globally, which continued to unfavorably impact market conditions throughout 2020 and these challenging market conditions could continue for an extended period of time. In an effort to contain the spread of COVID-19, maintain the well-being of our employees and stakeholders, match the reduced demand from our customers and in accordance with governmental requirements, we closed or partially shut down certain office, manufacturing, distribution and technical center facilities around the world in March 2020. Although most of our manufacturing, distribution and technical center facilities re-opened early in the second quarter of 2020, some operated at reduced capacities, most of our global office buildings remained closed through the remainder of 2020. Despite many of our markets recovering in the second half of 2020, the ongoing spread of the virus prior to widespread vaccination presents several risks to our business, especially in the first half of 2021. While the impacts of the pandemic and the resulting global recession are expected to be temporary, the duration of the production and supply chain disruptions, and related financial impacts, cannot be estimated at this time. Should the reduced manufacturing and distribution capacities continue for an extended period of time or worsen, the impact on our production and supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand. Our markets are cyclical in nature and we face periods when demand fluctuates significantly higher or lower than our normal operating levels, including COVID-19 related shut-downs. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting 19Table of Contentsour capacity are important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows. We manage our capacity by adjusting our manufacturing workforce, capital expenditures and purchases from suppliers. In periods of weak demand we may face under-utilized capacity and un-recovered overhead costs, while in periods of strong demand we may experience unplanned costs and could fail to meet customer demand. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to adequately adjust our manufacturing capacity in response to significant changes in customer demand, which could harm our business. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic and related reductions in demand forced certain of our customerâs facilities around the world to close or partially shut down operations, inhibiting our ability to forecast demand and caused related closures and partial shut-downs of certain of our manufacturing facilities. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers discontinuing outsourcing their engine supply needs, financial distress, particularly related to the COVID-19 pandemic or bankruptcy, or a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. Many are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers, financial distress of one of our large truck OEM customers due to the COVID-19 pandemic or bankruptcy or a change-in-control, could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A slowdown in infrastructure development and/or depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business. Infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth, but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years (especially in China and Brazil), commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in off-highway markets was weak. Weakness in commodity prices, including any negative impacts on commodity prices such as oil, gas and coal, adversely impacted mining industry participantsâ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years. Continued deterioration in infrastructure and commodities markets, including the impacts from COVID-19, could adversely affect our customersâ demand for vehicles and equipment and, as a result, could adversely affect our business.We may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flow from our investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture. A significant component of our investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture related to the expected growth in automated transmission products in North America and China. While we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve our original expectations within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. As part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture, significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. If cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts, these assets could be subject to non-cash impairment charges, negatively impacting our earnings.We derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees. For 2020, we recognized $452 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $330 million in 2019. Approximately half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from four of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd., Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Dongfeng Cummins Emission Solutions Co. Ltd. Although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.20Table of ContentsPRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGYOur products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to reputational risk, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues. Any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 12, ""PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.The development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services. We are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, hydrogen production and fuel cells, for planned introduction into certain new and existing markets. Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to our planned products, which will face competition from an array of other technologies and manufacturers.Â The increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified or alternate fuel powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments, we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims.We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.21Table of ContentsGENERALThe COVID-19 pandemic created disruptions and turmoil in global credit and financial markets and ongoing impacts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The COVID-19 pandemic created disruptions and turmoil in the global credit and financial markets and made it more difficult and costly for us to access capital on favorable terms to meet our liquidity needs. The disruptions to the global credit and financial markets could also have material negative impacts on business operations and financial positions of our customers and suppliers, which may negatively impact our orders, sales and supply chain. If the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on global credit and financial markets continue, or worsen, it could negatively impact our business, along with the financial condition of our customers and suppliers, and it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters. At December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 57,825 persons worldwide. Approximately 20,279 of our employees worldwide were represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2021 and 2025. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by us, our customers or suppliers, including any work stoppages or slowdowns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We rely on our executive leadership team and other key personnel as a critical part of our human capital resources. We depend on the skills, institutional knowledge, working relationships, and continued services and contributions of key personnel, including our executive leadership team as a critical part of our human capital resources. In addition, our ability to achieve our operating and strategic goals depends on our ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified individuals. We compete with other companies both within and outside of our industry for talented personnel and we may lose key personnel or fail to attract, train and retain other talented personnel. Any such loss or failure could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In particular, our continued success will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. If key employees terminate their employment or become ill as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our business activities may be adversely affected and our management teamâs attention may be diverted. In addition, we may not be able to locate suitable replacements for any key employees who leave.We may be adversely impacted by the effects of climate change and may incur increased costs and experience other impacts due to new or more stringent greenhouse gas regulations designed to address climate change. The scientific consensus indicates that emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) continue to alter the composition of Earthâs atmosphere in ways that are affecting, and are expected to continue to affect, the global climate. The potential impacts of climate change on our customers, product offerings, operations, facilities and suppliers are accelerating and uncertain, as they will be particular to local and customer-specific circumstances. These potential impacts may include, among other items, physical long-term changes in freshwater availability and the frequency and severity of weather events as well as customer product changes either through preference or regulation. Concerns regarding climate change may lead to additional international, national, regional and local legislative and regulatory responses. Various stakeholders, including legislators and regulators, shareholders and non-governmental organizations, are continuing to look for ways to reduce GHG emissions. We could face risks to our brand reputation, investor confidence and market share due to an inability to innovate and develop new products that decrease GHG emissions. Increased input costs, such as fuel and electricity, and compliance-related costs could also impact customer operations and demand for our products. As the impact of any future GHG legislative or regulatory requirements on our global businesses and products is dependent on the timing, scope and design of the mandates or standards, we are currently unable to predict its potential impact which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The regulation of GHG emissions could also increase our operating costs through higher utility, transportation and materials costs.22Table of ContentsOur plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks.Part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth, gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition.Similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.Our information technology systems and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. We face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important information technology system, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to prevent information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware, computer viruses and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, along with power outages or hardware failures. These threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information, create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, disrupt our ability to conduct our business, result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting government actions to restrict movement, a large percentage of our salaried employees are working remotely. This remote working environment may pose a heightened risk for security breaches or other disruptions of our information technology systems. In addition, our products, including our engines, contain interconnected and increasingly complex systems that control various processes and these systems are potentially subject to ""cyber attacks"" and disruption. The impact of a significant information technology event on either of our information technology systems or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:â¢public health crises, including the spread of a contagious disease, such as COVID-19, and other catastrophic events;23Table of Contentsâ¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; andâ¢changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.We face significant competition in the regions we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of performance, price, total cost of ownership, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging regions who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks.We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The U.S. dollar strengthened in recent years resulting in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years. If the U.S. dollar continues strengthening against other currencies, we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements.While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.24Table of ContentsSignificant declines in future financial and stock market conditions, particularly those related to the global recession due to the COVID-19 pandemic, could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in current and future financial and stock market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity and length of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case"
5,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2020-02-11,"ITEM 1A.Â Â Â Â Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements. We are conducting a formal internal review of our emission certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to our pick-up truck applications and working with the EPA and CARB, as well as the Department of Justice (DOJ) and SEC, to address their questions about these applications. The results of this formal review and regulatory and government agency processes, or the discovery of any noncompliance issues, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.We previously announced that we are conducting a formal internal review of our emissions certification process and compliance with emission standards with respect to all of our pick-up truck applications, following conversations with the EPA and CARB regarding certification of our engines for model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks. During conversations with the EPA and CARB about the effectiveness of our pick-up truck applications, the regulators raised concerns that certain aspects of our emissions systems may reduce the effectiveness of our emissions control systems and thereby act as defeat devices. As a result, our internal review focuses, in part, on the regulatorsâ concerns. We are working closely with the regulators to enhance our emissions systems to improve the effectiveness of all of our pick-up truck applications and to fully address the regulatorsâ requirements. Based on discussions with the regulators, we have developed a new calibration for the engines in model year 2019 RAM 2500 and 3500 trucks that has been included in all engines shipped since September 2019. During our discussions, the regulators have asked us to look at other model years and other engines, though the primary focus of our review has been the model year 2019 RAM. We will continue to work together closely with the relevant regulators to develop and implement recommendations for improvement as part of our ongoing commitment to compliance. We are also fully cooperating with the DOJ's and the SEC's information requests and inquiries.Due to the continuing nature of the formal review, our ongoing cooperation with the regulators and other government agencies, and the presence of many unknown facts and circumstances, we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters. It is possible that the consequences of any remediation plans resulting from our formal review and these regulatory and agency processes could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in the periods in which these emissions certification issues are addressed. Our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and, along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. Regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny. The discovery of noncompliance issues could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.17Table of ContentsIn addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Many of our on- and off-highway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles. In the second half of 2019 we experienced slowing of demand growth in most of our North American on-highway and certain off-highway markets, while international sales declined in most markets, including China. If the North American or Chinese markets suffer a significant downturn or if a slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our other significant international markets were to occur, depending upon the length, duration and severity of the slowdown, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our manufacturing and supply chain abilities may be adversely impacted by an extended shutdown of our operations in China due to the recent coronavirus outbreak. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus began to impact the population of Wuhan, China, where several of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are located.  In late January 2020, in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, maintain the wellbeing of our employees and in accordance with governmental requirements, we closed several production and distribution facilities in the Hubei Provence of China.  We rely upon these facilities to support our business in China, as well as to export components for use in products in other parts of the world.  While the closures and limitations on movement in the region are expected to be temporary, the duration of the production and supply chain disruption, and related financial impact, cannot be estimated at this time.  Should the production and distribution closures continue for an extended period of time, the impact on our supply chain in China and globally could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to reputational risk, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to known or suspected performance or safety issues. Any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 12, ""PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.The development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services. We are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, hydrogen generation and fuel cells, for planned introduction into certain existing and new markets.Â  Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products.Â  The increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We operate our business on a global basis and policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.We manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products. Changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, cause non-U.S. customers to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S. trade relationship with China, Brazil and France and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs (including, but not limited to, additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum) import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could adversely impact our 18Table of Contentsproduction costs, customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. A slowdown in infrastructure development and/or depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business. Infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth, but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years (especially in China and Brazil), commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in off-highway markets was weak. Weakness in commodity prices, such as oil, gas and coal, adversely impacted mining industry participantsâ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years. Deterioration, or renewed weakness, in infrastructure and commodities markets could adversely affect our customersâ demand for vehicles and equipment and, as a result, could adversely affect our business.The U.K.âs exit from the European Union (EU) could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.On January 31, 2020, the U.K. exited from the EU (BREXIT). Additionally, the results of the U.K.âs BREXIT has caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the U.K.âs future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be higher tariffs or greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U. K. and the EU and increased regulatory complexities. The effects of BREXIT will depend on any agreements the U.K. makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or on a permanent basis. These measures could potentially disrupt our supply chain, including delays of imports and exports, limited access to human capital within some of the target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate and adverse changes to tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, BREXIT could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to emissions and similar certifications granted to us by the EU, as the U.K. determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of BREXIT, among others, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services, including reductions in demand for diesel engines, could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.During 2019, we single sourced approximately 19 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs, compared to approximately 20 percent in 2018. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers (including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition), suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs.Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo, Navistar, Chrysler, Daimler, Dongfeng and Tata, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in 19Table of Contentsthe level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks.Part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth, gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.Our information technology systems and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. We face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important information technology system, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. While we continually work to safeguard our systems and mitigate potential risks, there is no assurance that these actions will be sufficient to prevent information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware, computer viruses and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, along with power outages or hardware failures. These threats could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information, create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, disrupt our ability to conduct our business, result in the loss of intellectual property or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. In addition, our products, including our engines, contain interconnected and increasingly complex systems that control various processes and these systems are potentially subject to ""cyber attacks"" and disruption. The impact of a significant information technology event on either of our information technology systems or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand. We can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline, while we can also experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining 20Table of Contentsour results of operations and cash flows. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to decrease our manufacturing capacity during market troughs, which could result in under-utilized manufacturing assets and unnecessary overhead costs or that we will be able to increase our manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products during market peaks, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business. If we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may experience difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing our cost reduction actions and announced restructuring initiatives, including achieving any anticipated savings and other benefits of these initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2019 and the first quarter of 2020 we are undertaking cost reduction actions and announced restructuring initiatives to respond to the slowdown in our global markets.  As we implement these initiatives, we may not realize anticipated savings or other benefits from one or more of the initiatives in the amounts or within the time periods we expect. Other events or circumstances, such as implementation difficulties and delays or unexpected costs, may occur which could result in us not realizing our targeted cost reductions. We are also subject to the risks of negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. If we are unable to realize the expected savings or benefits from these initiatives, certain aspects of our business may be adversely affected. If we experience any of these circumstances or otherwise fail to realize the anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Financial distress or a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers in North America which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. If one of our large truck OEM customers experiences financial distress, bankruptcy or a change-in-control, such circumstance could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flow from our investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture. Our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flow from our 2017 investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully launch the automated transmission products in North America and China and achieve our projected market penetration in those regions. While we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the goals within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. If we are not able to successfully complete our automated transmission strategy, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flows resulting from this joint venture may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. As part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture, significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. If cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts, these assets could be subject to non-cash impairment charges, negatively impacting our earnings.We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; andâ¢changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.21Table of ContentsAs we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.We face significant competition in the markets we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks.We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The U.S. dollar strengthened in recent years resulting in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years. If the U.S. dollar continues strengthening against other currencies, we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements.While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that 22Table of Contentsmight result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.We derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees. For 2019, we recognized $330 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $394 million in 2018. Approximately half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from four of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd., Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Dongfeng Cummins Emission Solutions Co. Ltd. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims.We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by 23Table of Contentscosts, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles or other applications could have a material adverse impact on our business over the long term.In an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities or countries of diesel-powered products in the near or distant future. These countries include China, India and Germany. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of diesel-powered vehicles by 2040. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our business over the long-term could experience material adverse impacts.We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.At December 31, 2019, we employed approximately 61,615 persons worldwide. Approximately 19,048 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2020 and 2024. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow"
3,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2019-02-11,"ITEM 1A.Â Â Â Â Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Many of our on- and off-highway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles. Although in 2018 we experienced demand growth in most of our North American on-highway and certain off-highway markets and continued strong demand in Chinese markets, as well as growth in many of our other international markets, if the North American or Chinese markets suffer a significant downturn or if a slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our other significant international markets were to occur, depending upon the length, duration and severity of the slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows would likely have a materially adverse impact. Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs.Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo, Navistar, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler, Dongfeng and Tata, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In fact, several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services. We are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, for planned introduction into certain existing and new markets.Â  Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products.Â  The increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could have a materially adverse impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our products are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements that can significantly increase our costs and, along with increased scrutiny from regulatory agencies and unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world, could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. Regulatory agencies are making certification and compliance with emissions and noise standards more stringent and subjecting diesel engine products to an increasing level of scrutiny. The discovery of noncompliance issues could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Developing engines and components to meet more stringent and changing regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our 17Table of Contentscompetitive advantage in the engine markets we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in our worldwide markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in a loss of our competitive advantage and could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to reputational risk, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have material adverse effects on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 9, ""PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.We operate our business on a global basis and policy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position.We manufacture, sell and service products globally and rely upon a global supply chain to deliver the raw materials, components, systems and parts that we need to manufacture and service our products. Changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, cause non-U.S. nationals to shift preferences toward domestically manufactured or branded products and impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the U.S. trade relationship with China, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements or arrangements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs (including, but not limited to, additional tariffs on the import of steel or aluminum) import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could adversely impact our production costs, customer demand and our relationships with customers and suppliers. Any of these consequences could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The United Kingdomâs decision to end its membership in the European Union could materially and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union (EU) in a national referendum (BREXIT). Additionally, the results of the United Kingdomâs BREXIT has caused, and may continue to cause, volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdomâs future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be higher tariffs or greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and the EU and increased regulatory complexities. The effects of BREXIT will depend on any agreements the United Kingdom makes to retain access to EU markets either during a transitional period or on a permanent basis. These measures could potentially disrupt our supply chain, access to human capital and some of our target markets and jurisdictions in which we operate, and adversely change tax benefits or liabilities in these or other jurisdictions. In addition, BREXIT could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to emissions and similar certifications granted to us by the EU, as the United Kingdom determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. Any of these effects of BREXIT, among others, could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services, including reductions in demand for diesel engines, could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, including with respect to the demand for diesel engines, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.18Table of ContentsA slowdown in infrastructure development and/or depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business. Infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth, but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years (especially in China and Brazil), commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in off-highway markets was weak. Weakness in commodity prices, such as oil, gas and coal, adversely impacted mining industry participantsâ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years. Although many of our off-highway markets began to recover in 2017 and 2018, additional deterioration, or renewed weakness, in infrastructure and commodities markets could adversely affect our customersâ demand for vehicles and equipment and, as a result, could adversely affect our business.We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.During 2018, we single sourced approximately 20 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs, compared to approximately 20 percent in 2017. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers (including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition), suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our information technology systems and our products are exposed to potential security breaches or other disruptions which may adversely impact our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. We face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important information technology system, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware, computer viruses and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, along with power outages or hardware failures, could result in unauthorized public disclosures of information and create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, disrupt our ability to conduct our business or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. In addition, our products, including our engines, contain interconnected and increasingly complex systems that control various processes and these systems are potentially subject to ""cyber attacks"" and disruption. The impact of a significant information technology event on either of our information technology systems or our products could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Financial distress or a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers could have a materially adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers in North America which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. If one of our large truck OEM customers experiences financial distress, bankruptcy or a change-in-control, such circumstance could likely lead to significant reductions in our sales volumes, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees.For 2018, we recognized $394 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $357 million in 2017. Approximately half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from four of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd., Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd.and Dongfeng Cummins Emission Solutions Co. Ltd. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or 19Table of Contentstheir operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.Our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploration of strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks.Part of our strategic plan is to improve our revenue growth, gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.We may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings and cash flow from our investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture.Our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flow from our 2017 investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully launch the automated transmission products in North America and achieve our projected market penetration. While we believe we will ultimately achieve these objectives, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the goals within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. If we are not able to successfully complete our automated transmission strategy, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flows resulting from this joint venture may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. As part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture, significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. If cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts, these assets could be subject to impairment charges, negatively impacting our earnings.We face significant competition in the markets we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, emissions compliance, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.20Table of ContentsIncreasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks.We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The U.S. dollar strengthened in recent years resulting in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years. If the U.S. dollar continues strengthening against other currencies, we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements.While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;21Table of Contentsâ¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; andâ¢changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.The adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation) and all adjustments to the 2017 estimates were incorporated into our financial results in 2018. There continues to be a risk that states or foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to the Tax Legislation, which could have a material impact on our future results.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.We can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations and cash flows. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims.We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in 22Table of Contentsdefending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles or other applications could have a materially adverse impact on our business over the long term.In an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change, multiple countries and cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities or countries of diesel-powered products in the near or distant future. These countries include China, India and Germany. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of diesel-powered vehicles by 2040. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our business over the long-term could experience materially adverse impacts.We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.At December 31, 2018, we employed approximately 62,610 persons worldwide. Approximately 21,460 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2019 and 2022. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.23Table of ContentsOur financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position"
7,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2018-02-14,"ITEM 1A.Â Â Â Â Risk Factors
 Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Many of our on- and off-highway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles. Although in 2017 we experienced demand growth in most of our North American and Chinese on-highway markets and certain off-highway markets as well as growth in many of our international markets, if the North American or Chinese markets suffer a significant downturn or if a slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our other significant international markets were to occur, depending upon the length, duration and severity of the slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows would likely be materially adversely affected. Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs.Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo , Navistar, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler and Dongfeng, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In fact, several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The development of new technologies may materially reduce the demand for our current products and services. We are investing in new products and technologies, including electrified powertrains, for planned introduction into certain existing and new markets.Â  Given the early stages of development of some of these new products and technologies, there can be no guarantee of the future market acceptance and investment returns with respect to these planned products.Â  The increased adoption of electrified powertrains in some market segments could result in lower demand for current diesel or natural gas engines and components and, over time, reduce the demand for related parts and service revenues from diesel or natural gas powertrains. Furthermore, it is possible that we may not be successful in developing segment-leading electrified powertrains and some of our existing customers could choose to develop their own electrified or alternate fuel powertrains, or source from other manufacturers, and any of these factors could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The discovery of any significant additional problems with our engine platforms or aftertreatment systems in North America could further materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. During 2017, the CARB and U.S. EPA selected certain of our pre-2013 model year engine systems for additional emissions testing. Some of these engine systems failed CARB and EPA's tests as a result of degradation of an aftertreatment component. We have not been issued an official notice from the CARB or EPA regarding these particular engine systems. We are working with the agencies and will meet with them beginning in the first quarter of 2018, to develop a resolution of these matters. We are developing and testing a variety of solutions to address the technical issues, which could include a combination of calibration changes, service practices and hardware changes.In addition, we continue to evaluate other engine systems for model years 2010 through 2015 that could potentially be subject to similar aftertreatment component degradation issues.Â  At the close of 2017, we had not yet determined the impact to other model years or engine systems or the percentage of the engine system populations that could be affected. 17Table of ContentsSince there are many unresolved variables with respect to these degradation issues, we are not yet able to estimate the financial impact of these matters. It is possible that they could have a material impact on our results of operations in the periods in which these degradation issues are resolved and a solution is determined.Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 12, ""COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services, including reductions in demand for diesel engines, could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.A slowdown in infrastructure development and/or depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business. Infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth, but as the pace of investment in infrastructure slowed in recent years (especially in China and Brazil), commodity prices were significantly lower and demand for our products in off-highway markets was weak. Weakness in commodities, such as oil, gas and coal, adversely impacted mining industry participantsâ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products over the past several years. Although many of our off-highway markets began to recover in 2017, additional deterioration, or renewed weakness, in infrastructure and commodities markets could adversely affect our customersâ demand for vehicles and equipment and could adversely affect our business.Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to ensure our engines comply with these emission standards. Developing engines and components to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases, we are required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected thereby, in some cases, negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines. We derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees. For 2017, we recognized $357 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $301 million in 2016. More than half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in 18Table of ContentsChina - Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. The adoption of new tax legislation, changes in our provisional estimates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Legislation). The estimated effects based upon current interpretation of the Tax Legislation have been incorporated into our financial results. As additional data is prepared and analyzed and as additional clarification and implementation guidance is issued on the new tax law, it may be necessary to adjust the provisional amounts. Any adjustments could have a material impact on provisional amounts. In addition, there is a risk that states or foreign jurisdictions may amend their tax laws in response to the Tax Legislation, which could have a material impact on our future results.We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security. We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and related infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important information technology system, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and rely on the cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The data handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, could result in unauthorized disclosures of information and create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Financial distress or a change-in-control of one of our large truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers in North America which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. If one of our large truck OEM customers experiences financial distress, bankruptcy or a change-in-control, such circumstance could likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.19Table of ContentsOur plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploring strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks. Part of our strategic plan is to improve our gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers. During 2017, we single sourced approximately 20 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs, compared to approximately 56 percent in 2016. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations. We face significant competition in the markets we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas, electrification and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.20Table of ContentsPolicy changes affecting international trade could adversely impact the demand for our products and our competitive position. Changes in government policies on foreign trade and investment can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and efforts to withdraw from, or substantially modify such agreements, in addition to the implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, exchange controls or new barriers to entry, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Additionally, the results of the United Kingdomâs referendum on EU membership,Â advising for the exit from the EU, has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations and global economic uncertainty. Although it is unknown what the terms of the United Kingdomâs future relationship with the EU will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and EU and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely impact customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers and our results of operations.We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. Although the U.S. dollar weakened in 2017, the U.S. dollar strengthened in recent years through 2016 and resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues in those years. If the U.S. dollar returns to strengthening against other currencies, we will experience additional volatility in our financial statements.While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.We may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flow from our investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture. Our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flow from our recent investment in the Eaton Cummins Automated Transmission Technologies joint venture will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully launch the automated transmission products in North America and achieve our projected market penetration. While we believe 21Table of Contentswe will ultimately achieve these objectives, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the goals within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. If we are not able to successfully complete our automated transmission strategy, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, and cash flows resulting from this joint venture may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected. As part of the purchase accounting associated with the formation of the joint venture, significant goodwill and intangible asset balances were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet. If cash flows from the joint venture fall short of our anticipated amounts, these assets could be subject to impairment charges, negatively impacting our earnings.We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include: â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.; â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations; â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and â¢changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us. Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk. Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries, as well as new regulatory requirements regarding data privacy, such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand. We can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. If we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in 22Table of Contentsdefending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material. Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles, in an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions, could materially adversely affect our business over the long term. In an effort to limit greenhouse gas emissions, mayors of several large international cities announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities of diesel-powered vehicles by 2025. These cities include Athens, Madrid, Mexico City and Paris. Similarly, Germany adopted legislation to ban new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030, and China is considering a ban on the production and sale of diesel-powered vehicles to be adopted in the near future. In addition, California government officials have called for the state to phase out sales of diesel-powered vehicles by 2040. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our business over the long-term could be materially adversely affected. We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy. The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material. We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.At December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 58,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 20,830 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2018 and 2022. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have 23Table of Contentsunionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position"
10,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2017-02-13,"ITEM 1A.Â Â Â Â Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.A sustained slowdown or more significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Many of our on- and off-highway markets are cyclical in nature and experience volatility in demand throughout these cycles as experienced in 2016 with downward market pressure both domestically and internationally. While North American on-highway markets remained strong for several years, in 2016, these markets began to decline as they transitioned to a lower demand cycle as evidenced by the slowing demand for heavy-duty trucks as a result of lower capital spending by truck fleets in response to weak growth in the economy. Most international markets in 2016 continued to experience weak demand consistent with the last several years, especially in South America, the Middle East, U.K., Singapore and Mexico. If the North American markets suffer a further significant downturn or if the slower pace of economic growth and weaker demand in our significant international markets were to persist or worsen, depending upon the length, duration and severity of the slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows would likely be materially adversely affected. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may need to realign capacity with demand, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain businesses. Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may discontinue outsourcing their engine supply needs.Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB, Navistar, Fiat Chrysler, Daimler and Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd., are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own vehicles. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission compliance capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In fact, several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.Financial distress of one of our large truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large on-highway truck OEM customers in North America which have been an integral part of our positive business results for several years. If one of our large truck OEM customers experiences financial distress or bankruptcy, such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Lower-than-anticipated market acceptance of our new or existing products or services. Although we conduct market research before launching new or refreshed engines and introducing new services, many factors both within and outside our control affect the success of new or existing products and services in the marketplace. Offering engines and services that customers desire and value can mitigate the risks of increasing price competition and declining demand, but products and services that are perceived to be less than desirable (whether in terms of price, quality, overall value, fuel efficiency or other attributes) can exacerbate these risks. With increased consumer interconnectedness through the internet, social media and other media, mere allegations relating to poor quality, safety, fuel efficiency, corporate responsibility or other key attributes can negatively impact our reputation or market acceptance of our products or services, even if such allegations prove to be inaccurate or unfounded.17Table of ContentsThe discovery of any significant problems with our recently-introduced engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. The EPA and CARB have certified all of our 2017 on-highway engines, which utilize SCR technology to meet requisite emission and GHG levels. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of our engine platforms impacts a number of our operating segments and remains crucial to our success in North America. The discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk, and could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Further slowdown in infrastructure development and/or continuing depressed commodity prices could adversely affect our business. Infrastructure development and strong commodity prices have been significant drivers of our historical growth, but as the pace of investment in infrastructure has slowed (especially in China and Brazil), commodity prices have been significantly lower in recent years and demand for our products in off-highway markets has remained weak for several years. Weakness in commodities, such as oil, gas and coal, has adversely impacted mining industry participantsâ demand for vehicles and equipment that contain our engines and other products. Further deterioration, or continued weakness, in infrastructure and commodities markets will continue to adversely affect our customersâ demand for vehicles and equipment and will adversely affect our business.Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the EU, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to ensure our engines comply with these emission standards. Developing engines and components to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases, we are required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our competitive advantage in the engine markets we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected thereby, in some cases, negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. The U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent years and has resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our revenues. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies, we will continue to experience additional volatility in our financial statements.While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our future results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our 18Table of Contentsforeign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. See Management's Discussion and Analysis for additional information.We derive significant earnings from investees that we do not directly control, with more than 50 percent of these earnings from our China-based investees. For 2016, we recognized $301 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $315 million in 2015. More than half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China, Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd., Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. We may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits from the acquisition and integration of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors. Our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits from our recent distributor acquisitions will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully complete the integration of the acquired distributors with our other businesses. While we believe we will ultimately achieve these expected benefits, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the objectives within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. The expected benefits from integration also may not be fully realized or may be delayed due to certain prohibitions in applicable state franchise and distributor laws. If we are not able to successfully complete our integration strategy, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits resulting from our distributor acquisitions may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected.Delays encountered or increased costs incurred in completing the integration of these acquisitions could negatively impact our revenues, expenses, operating results, cash flow and financial condition, including the loss of current customers or suppliers, increased exposure to legal claims and other liabilities and the distraction or departure of key managers and employees.Our plan to reposition our portfolio of product offerings through exploring strategic acquisitions and divestitures may expose us to additional costs and risks. Part of our strategic plan is to improve our gross margins and earnings by exploring the repositioning of our portfolio of product line offerings through the pursuit of potential strategic acquisitions and/or divestitures to provide future strategic, financial and operational benefits and improve shareholder value. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these transactions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic transaction depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete specific transactions. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Strategic transactions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic acquisitions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. Also, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Similarly, any strategic divestiture of a product line or business may reduce our revenue and earnings, reduce the diversity of our business, result in substantial costs and expenses and cause disruption to our employees, customers, vendors and communities in which we operate.We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers. During 2016, we single sourced approximately 20 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs, compared to approximately 56 percent in 2015. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple 19Table of Contentsmanufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations. Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See Note 12, ""COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.We face significant competition in the markets we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets. Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into, and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and, as a result, we may be pressured to restrict the sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security. We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important information technology system, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. As customers adopt and 20Table of Contentsrely on the cloud-based digital technologies and services we offer, any disruption of the confidentiality, integrity or availability of those services could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The information handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Information technology security threats, such as security breaches, computer malware and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication, could result in unauthorized disclosures of information and create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions, or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Approximately 46 percent of our net sales for 2016 and 44 percent in 2015 were attributable to customers outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include: â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.; â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations; â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and â¢changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes to our assertions regarding permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision. Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk. Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption, such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. 21Table of ContentsWe face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand. We can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. If we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is exposed to potential product liability claims. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material. We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy. The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material. 22Table of ContentsWe may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.At December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 55,400 persons worldwide. Approximately 18,340 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2017 and 2021. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slowdowns experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slowdowns or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.Our financial statements are subject to the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States of America, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position. Future bans or limitations on the use of diesel-powered vehicles could materially adversely affect our business over the long term.Mayors of several large international cities have announced that they plan to implement a ban on the use in their cities of diesel-powered vehicles by 2025. Similarly, Germany adopted legislation to ban new internal combustion engine vehicles by 2030. To the extent that these types of bans are actually implemented in the future on a broad basis, or in one or more of our key markets, our business over the long-term could be materially adversely affected"
6,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2016-02-12,"ITEM 1A.Â Â Â Â Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Our financial performance in the last 3 years has been supported by improving demand in on-highway markets in North America, while demand in most international markets has been weak. Our revenues from international markets have been significantly impacted by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations related to the stronger U.S. dollar and slower growth in emerging markets, especially China, which has negatively impacted global demand for off-highway equipment. If the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown, depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows would almost certainly be materially adversely affected. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses. A downturn in the North American truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We recognize significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck OEMs in North America. The North American on-highway markets have been a large driver of our positive business results for the last few years. If the North American truck market suffers a significant downturn, or if one of our large truck OEM customers experiences financial distress or bankruptcy, such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB, Navistar, Fiat Chrysler Daimler and DCEC, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. In fact, several of these customers have expressed their intention to significantly increase their own engine production and to decrease engine purchases from us. In addition, increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.The discovery of any significant problems with our recently-introduced engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. The EPA and CARB have certified all of our 2012/2013 on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize SCR technology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platforms in 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America. While these 2010 and 2013 engine platforms have generally performed well in the field, the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms  could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk, and could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.17Table of ContentsFurther slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business. Infrastructure development has been a significant driver of growth over time, but as the pace of investment in infrastructure has slowed in recent years, especially in the emerging markets of China and Brazil, demand for our products in off-highway markets has weakened. If the slowdown in infrastructure development continues or increases in severity as a result of weaker economic growth or other circumstances, our business could be adversely affected.Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards. Developing engines and components to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases, we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change. Any delays in implementation or enforcement could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected thereby, in some cases, negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. The U.S. dollar has strengthened in recent years and has resulted in material unfavorable impacts on our financial statements. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen against other currencies, we will continue to experience additional unfavorable impacts to our financial statements.While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. We derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2015, we recognized $315 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $370 million in 2014. Approximately half of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from three of our 50 percent owned joint ventures in China, Beijing Foton Cummins Engine Co., Ltd. (BFCEC), Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (CCEC). As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 18Table of ContentsWe may fail to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits from the integration of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors. Our ability to realize all of the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits from our recent distributor acquisitions will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully complete the integration of the acquired distributors with our other businesses. While we believe we will ultimately achieve these expected benefits, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve all of the objectives within our anticipated time frame or in the anticipated amounts. The expected benefits from integration also may not be fully realized or may be delayed due to certain prohibitions in applicable state franchise and distributor laws. If we are not able to successfully complete our integration strategy, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits, resulting from our distributor acquisitions may not be realized fully or may take longer to realize than expected.Delays encountered or increased costs incurred in completing the integration of these acquisitions could negatively impact our revenues, expenses, operating results, cash flow and financial condition after completion of the acquisitions, including the loss of current customers or suppliers, increased exposure to legal claims and other liabilities and the distraction or departure of key managers and employees.Our plan to grow through strategic acquisitions may expose us to additional costs and risks. Part of our strategic plan is to increase our revenue and earnings by strategic acquisitions if we determine they are likely to provide future financial and operational benefits. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable candidates or consummate these acquisitions on favorable terms. The successful identification and completion of any strategic acquisition depends on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control, including the availability of suitable candidates and our ability to negotiate terms acceptable to all parties involved, conclude satisfactory agreements and obtain all necessary regulatory approvals. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully negotiate and complete a specific transaction. In addition, our ability to effectively integrate any potential acquisition into our existing business and culture may not be successful, which could jeopardize future financial and operational performance for the combined businesses. The exploration, negotiation and consummation of strategic transactions may involve significant expenditures by us, which may adversely affect our results of operations at the time such expenses are incurred, and may divert managementâs attention from our existing business. Acquisitions also may have adverse effects on our existing business relationships with suppliers and customers.If required, the financing for strategic transactions could result in an increase in our indebtedness, dilute the interests of our shareholders or both. Any acquisition may not be accretive to us for a significant period of time following the completion of such acquisition. In addition, if an acquisition results in any additional goodwill or increase in other intangible assets on our balance sheet and subsequently becomes impaired, we would be required to record a non-cash impairment charge, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We may experience difficulties and delays or unexpected costs in completing our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, including achieving any anticipated savings and other benefits of these initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we undertook restructuring and cost reduction initiatives to respond to the slowdown in our global markets.  As we implement these initiatives, we may not realize anticipated savings or other benefits from one or more of the initiatives in the amounts or within the time periods we expect. Other events and circumstances, such as implementation difficulties and delays or unexpected costs, may occur which could result in our not realizing our targeted cost reductions. We are also subject to the risks of negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. If we are unable to realize the expected savings or benefits from these initiatives, certain aspects of our business may be adversely affected. If we experience any of these circumstances or otherwise fail to realize the anticipated savings or benefits from our restructuring and cost reduction initiatives, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers. During 2015, we single sourced approximately 56 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs, compared to approximately 55 percent in 2014. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations. 19Table of ContentsOur products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments and contractual pricing adjustments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins. Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We face significant competition in the markets we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets. For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see âOperating Segmentsâ in âItem 1 Business.â Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and, as a result, we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security. We rely on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and data security infrastructure in connection with various aspects of our business activities. We also rely on our ability to expand and continually update these systems and infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. As we implement new systems, they may not perform as expected. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades. In addition, some of these systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control. If we experience a problem with an important information technology system, including during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation.The information handled by our information technology systems is vulnerable to security threats. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Information technology security threats such as security breaches, computer malware and other ""cyber attacks,"" which are increasing in both frequency and sophistication could result in unauthorized disclosures of information and create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation 20Table of Contentswith customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Approximately 44 percent of our net sales for 2015 and 48 percent in 2014 were attributable to customers outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include: â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.; â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations; â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and â¢changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes to our assertions regarding permanent reinvestment of our foreign earnings, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision. Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk. Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand. We can experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. If we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 21Table of ContentsOur business is exposed to risks of product liability claims. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. At any given time, we are subject to various and multiple product liability claims, any one of which, if decided adversely to us, may have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operation in the period in which our liability with respect to any such claim is recognized. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. Furthermore, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material. We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy. The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material. We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.At December 31, 2015, we employed approximately 55,200 persons worldwide. Approximately 17,740 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2016 and 2021. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 22Table of ContentsOur financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.

Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. The U.S. economy began to improve in 2014, although many international markets continued to struggle. If the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown; depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses. A slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business. Infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years, especially in the emerging markets of China and Brazil. General weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt could lead to a decline in infrastructure spending. Any sustained downturns in infrastructure development that result from these or other circumstances could adversely affect our business.Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards. Developing engines to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases, we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emissions. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change, or delays which could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some cases negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines. We derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control. Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2014, we recognized $370 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $361 million in 2013. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from our  unconsolidated North American distributors and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (CCEC) at December 31, 2014. Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors ranged from 49 percent to 50 percent at December 31, 2014. We have 50 percent equity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 17Table of ContentsOur truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs. Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB, Navistar, Chrysler and DCEC, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A downturn in the North American truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We make significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck OEMs in North America. If the North American truck market suffers a significant downturn, or if one of our large truck OEM customers experienced financial distress or bankruptcy, such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. The discovery of any significant problems with our recently-introduced engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. The EPA and CARB have certified all of our 2012/2013 on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize SCR technology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platforms in 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America. While these 2010 and 2013 engine platforms have performed well in the field, the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk, and could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers. During 2014, we single sourced approximately 55 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations. Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins. 18Table of ContentsOur products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Failure to successfully integrate the planned acquisitions of the equity we do not already own of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors could have an adverse impact on our realization of expected benefits to our financial condition and results of operations. The completion of our plan to acquire all of the equity we do not already own of our partially- owned United States and Canadian distributors (each, an ''Acquisition,'' and collectively, the ''Acquisitions''), is subject to various risks, including, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the incremental revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of the Acquisitions within the anticipated time frame, or at all; the costs that are expected to be incurred in connection with evaluating, negotiating, consummating and integrating the Acquisitions; the ability of management to focus adequate time and attention on evaluating, negotiating, consummating and integrating the Acquisitions; and diversion of management's attention from base strategies and objectives, both during and after the acquisition process. Further, as with all merger and acquisition activity, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate, consummate and integrate the Acquisitions in accordance with our plans. Those persons holding the third-party ownership of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors may not agree to our acquisition proposals, including the terms and conditions thereof, and may claim that our proposals to exercise certain contractual rights that we have with respect to acquiring such distributors may violate applicable state franchise and distributor laws, which may prohibit, delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of such Acquisitions on terms and conditions that are less favorable to us than we currently anticipate, or not at all. After completion of the Acquisitions, we may fail to realize the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits. The financial success of the Acquisitions will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully combine our business with the businesses of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors, transition operations and realize the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits from such Acquisitions. While we currently believe that these enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits estimates are achievable, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Our enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits estimates also depend on our ability to execute and integrate the Acquisitions in a manner that permits those benefits to be realized. If these estimates turn out to be incorrect or we are not able to execute our integration strategy successfully, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits, resulting from the Acquisitions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integration in order to realize the anticipated benefits and costs savings of the Acquisitions include, among other things: â¢maintaining and improving management and employee engagement, morale, motivation and productivity; â¢recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; â¢retaining and strengthening relationships with existing customers and attracting new customers; â¢conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among the companies; â¢consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures; â¢consolidating sales, customer service and marketing operations; â¢identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; â¢integrating the distribution, sales, customer service and administrative support activities among the companies; â¢integrating information technology systems, including those systems managing data security for sensitive employee, customer and vendor information, and diverse network applications across the companies; 19Table of Contentsâ¢managing the broadened competitive landscape, including responding to the actions taken by competitors in response to the Acquisitions; â¢coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; â¢managing the additional business risks of businesses that we have not previously directly managed; and â¢managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of the Acquisitions. Delays encountered in the process of integrating the Acquisitions could negatively impact our revenues, expenses, operating results, cash flow and financial condition after completion of the Acquisitions, including through the loss of current customers or suppliers. Although significant benefits, such as enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow and cost savings, are expected to result from the Acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will realize any of these anticipated benefits after completion of any or all of the Acquisitions. Additionally, significant costs are expected to be incurred in connection with the integration of the Acquisitions. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred, including costs associated with assuming our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors' exposure to outstanding and anticipated legal claims and other liabilities. Although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other synergies and efficiencies related to the integration of the Acquisitions, will offset incremental integration-related costs over time, no assurances can be given that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. In addition, the process of integrating the operations of our partially- owned United States and Canadian distributors may distract management and employees from delivering against base strategies and objectives, which could negatively impact other segments of our business following the completion of the Acquisitions. Furthermore, the Acquisitions and the related integration efforts, could result in the departure of key managers and employees, and we may fail to identify managerial resources to fill both executive-level and lower-level managerial positions and replace key employees, including those who oversee customer relationships, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, and, prior to the completion of the Acquisitions, the businesses of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors. The completion of the Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of certain required clearances or approvals from governmental entities that could prevent or delay their completion or impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us. Completion of each of the Acquisitions may be conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental clearances or approvals, including, but not limited to, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under U.S. competition and trade laws with respect to such Acquisitions as well as applicable state regulations and restrictions. There can be no assurance that these clearances and approvals will be obtained, and, additionally, government authorities from which these clearances and approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of any, or all, of the Acquisitions or require changes to their respective terms. If, in order to obtain any clearances or approvals required to complete any of the Acquisitions, we become subject to any material conditions after completion of any of such Acquisitions, our business and results of operations after completion of any of such Acquisitions may be adversely affected. We face significant competition in the markets we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets. For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see âOperating Segmentsâ in âItem 1 Business.â 20Table of ContentsIncreasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and, as a result, we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, information technology security threats and sophisticated ""cyber attacks."" We rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with various of our business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware and other âcyber attacksâ are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. These threats could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Approximately 48 percent of our net sales for 2014 and 52 percent in 2013 were attributable to customers outside the U.S. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include: â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.; â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations; â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and â¢changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes to our assertions regarding permanent re-investment of our foreign earnings, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision. 21Table of ContentsOur global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk. Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand. We can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. We may need to write off significant investments in our new North American light-duty diesel engine platform if customer commitments deteriorate. We began development of a new North American light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety of on- and off-highway applications. Since that time, and as of December 31, 2014, we have capitalized investments of approximately $251 million. Market uncertainty due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remained active. We reached an agreement to supply Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. with our light-duty diesel engine beginning in 2015, however, if customer expectations or volume projections deteriorate from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material. 22Table of ContentsWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations. Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy. The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material. We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.As of December 31, 2014, we employed approximately 54,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 17,680 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2015 and 2019. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 23Table of ContentsOur financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position. Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position"
4,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2014-02-18,"ITEM 1A.Â Â Â Â Risk Factors
Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties.  Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  Global economic uncertainty continued throughout 2013 as we experienced declining or relatively flat demand in many global markets.  If the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown; depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses. A slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business. Infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years, especially in the emerging markets of China and Brazil.  General weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuilt could lead to a decline in infrastructure spending. Any sustained downturns in infrastructure development that result from these or other circumstances could adversely affect our business.Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adversely affect our business. Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed by the EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world.  We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with these emission standards. Developing engines to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emission requirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets.  In some cases, we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emission.  While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve.  The successful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.  In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards in emerging markets are unpredictable and subject to change, or delays which could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some cases negating our competitive advantage.  This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines.  We derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control. Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2013, we recognized $361 million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $384 million in 2012. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees is from our nine unconsolidated North American distributors and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (DCEC) and Chongqing Cummins Engine Company, Ltd. (CCEC).  Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors ranged from 50 percent to 50 percent at December 31, 361.  We have  percent equity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control their management or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these entities.  A significant reduction in the level of contribution by these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 17Table of ContentsOur truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.  Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB, Navistar, Chrysler and DCEC, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own products.  Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus.  However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future.  Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries.  Any significant reduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. A downturn in the North American truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results of operations. We make significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck OEMs in North America.  If the North American truck market suffers a significant downturn, or if one of our large truck OEM customers experienced financial distress or bankruptcy, such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in our revenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. The discovery of any significant problems with our recently-introduced engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. The EPA and CARB have certified all of our 2012/2013 on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize SCR technology to meet requisite emission levels.  We introduced SCR technology into our engine platforms in 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America.  While these 2010 and 2013 engine platforms have performed well in the field, the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk, and could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers. During 2013, we single sourced approximately 60 to 70 percent of the total types of parts in our product designs.  Any delay in our suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions.  Delays may be caused by factors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers' allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism.  Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers and our results of operations. Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs. Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material and commodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions.  Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure.  While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price.  As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins. 18Table of ContentsOur products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.   Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.  Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation, loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs.  Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue.  Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Failure to successfully integrate the planned acquisitions of the equity we do not already own of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors could have an adverse impact on our realization of expected benefits to our financial condition and results of operations. The completion of our plan to acquire all of the equity we do not already own of our partially- owned United States and Canadian distributors (each, an ''Acquisition,'' and collectively, the ''Acquisitions''), is subject to various risks, including, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the incremental revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits that we expect to realize as a result of the completion of the Acquisitions within the anticipated time frame, or at all; the costs that are expected to be incurred in connection with evaluating, negotiating, consummating and integrating the Acquisitions; the ability of management to focus adequate time and attention on evaluating, negotiating, consummating and integrating the Acquisitions; and diversion of management's attention from base strategies and objectives, both during and after the acquisition process.  Further, as with all merger and acquisition activity, there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate, consummate and integrate the Acquisitions in accordance with our plans.  Those persons holding the third-party ownership of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors may not agree to our acquisition proposals, including the terms and conditions thereof, and may claim that our proposals to exercise certain contractual rights that we have with respect to acquiring such distributors may violate applicable state franchise and distributor laws, which may prohibit, delay or otherwise adversely affect the consummation of such Acquisitions on terms and conditions that are less favorable to us than we currently anticipate, or not at all. After completion of the Acquisitions, we may fail to realize the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits. The financial success of the Acquisitions will depend, in substantial part, on our ability to successfully combine our business with the businesses of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors, transition operations and realize the expected enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits from such Acquisitions. While we currently believe that these enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits estimates are achievable, it is possible that we will be unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all. Our enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits estimates also depend on our ability to execute and integrate the Acquisitions in a manner that permits those benefits to be realized. If these estimates turn out to be incorrect or we are not able to execute our integration strategy successfully, the anticipated enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow, cost savings and other benefits, resulting from the Acquisitions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected. Specifically, issues that must be addressed in integration in order to realize the anticipated benefits and costs savings of the Acquisitions include, among other things: â¢maintaining and improving management and employee engagement, morale, motivation and productivity; â¢recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; â¢retaining and strengthening relationships with existing customers and attracting new customers; â¢conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures among the companies; â¢consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures; â¢consolidating sales, customer service and marketing operations; â¢identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; â¢integrating the distribution, sales, customer service and administrative support activities among the companies; â¢integrating information technology systems, including those systems managing data security for sensitive employee, customer and vendor information, and diverse network applications across the companies; 19Table of Contentsâ¢managing the broadened competitive landscape, including responding to the actions taken by competitors in response to the Acquisitions; â¢coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; â¢managing the additional business risks of businesses that we have not previously directly managed; and â¢managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of the Acquisitions. Delays encountered in the process of integrating the Acquisitions could negatively impact our revenues, expenses, operating results, cash flow and financial condition after completion of the Acquisitions, including through the loss of current customers or suppliers. Although significant benefits, such as enhanced revenue, earnings, cash flow and cost savings, are expected to result from the Acquisitions, there can be no assurance that we will realize any of these anticipated benefits after completion of any or all of the Acquisitions. Additionally, significant costs are expected to be incurred in connection with the integration of the Acquisitions. We continue to assess the magnitude of these costs and additional unanticipated costs may be incurred, including costs associated with assuming our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors' exposure to outstanding and anticipated legal claims and other liabilities. Although we believe that the elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other synergies and efficiencies related to the integration of the Acquisitions, will offset incremental integration-related costs over time, no assurances can be given that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. In addition, the process of integrating the operations of our partially- owned United States and Canadian distributors may distract management and employees from delivering against base strategies and objectives, which could negatively impact other segments of our business following the completion of the Acquisitions. Furthermore, the Acquisitions and the related integration efforts, could result in the departure of key managers and employees, and we may fail to identify managerial resources to fill both executive-level and lower-level managerial positions and replace key employees, including those who oversee customer relationships, any of which could have a negative impact on our business, and, prior to the completion of the Acquisitions, the businesses of our partially-owned United States and Canadian distributors. The completion of the Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of certain required clearances or approvals from governmental entities that could prevent or delay their completion or impose conditions that could have an adverse effect on us. Completion of each of the Acquisitions may be conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental clearances or approvals, including, but not limited to, the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods under U.S. competition and trade laws with respect to such Acquisitions as well as applicable state regulations and restrictions. There can be no assurance that these clearances and approvals will be obtained, and, additionally, government authorities from which these clearances and approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of any, or all, of the Acquisitions or require changes to their respective terms. If, in order to obtain any clearances or approvals required to complete any of the Acquisitions, we become subject to any material conditions after completion of any of such Acquisitions, our business and results of operations after completion of any of such Acquisitions may be adversely affected. We face significant competition in the markets we serve. The markets in which we operate are highly competitive.  We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products.  We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas and other technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies.  Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support.  We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.  For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see âOperating Segmentsâ in âItem 1 Business.â  20Table of ContentsIncreasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth. As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products to other countries.  This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greater demand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing.  As these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasingly begin to compete with our existing customers in these markets.  Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and, as a result, we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition.  In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers. We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, information technology security threats and sophisticated ""cyber attacks."" We rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with various of our business activities.  Some of these networks and systems are managed by third party service providers and are not under our direct control.  Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters.  Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware and other âcyber attacksâ are increasing in both frequency and sophistication.  These threats could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders.  We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.  We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business. Approximately 52 percent of our net sales for 2013 and 53 percent in 2012 were attributable to customers outside the U.S.   Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries.  These risks include: â¢the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems; â¢trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; â¢the imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.; â¢the imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; â¢difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations; â¢required compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and â¢changes in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets. As we continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks.  There can be no assurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us. Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect our profitability.  We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions.  Our income tax provision and cash tax liability in the future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes to our assertions regarding permanent re-investment of our foreign earnings, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S.  We are also subject to ongoing tax audits.  These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental.  Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us.  We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.  The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision. 21Table of ContentsOur global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk. Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around the world.   Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws from other countries.  Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that differ from those of the U.S.  The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted. We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand. We can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can also experience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline.  Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations.  We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business.   However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins.  If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims. We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform to specification results or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death.  We may experience material product liability losses in the future.  While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims.  In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimate outcome.  An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us.  In addition, even if we are successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us. We may need to write off significant investments in our new North American light-duty diesel engine platform if customer commitments deteriorate. We began development of a new North American light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety of on- and off-highway applications.  Since that time, and as of December 31, 2013, we have capitalized investments of approximately $242 million.  Market uncertainty due to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remained active. In August 2013, we reached an agreement to supply Nissan Motor Co. Ltd. with our light-duty diesel engine beginning in 2015, however, if customer expectations or volume projections deteriorate from our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value. Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations. Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials.  While we believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.  We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property.  If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material. 22Table of ContentsWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate and other related risks. We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies.  We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues.  In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations.  While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include foreign currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance that foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We also face risks arising from the imposition of foreign exchange controls and currency devaluations.  Foreign exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls.  Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation. We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy. The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy.  High energy costs generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate.  Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fuel economy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease.  The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging market countries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators.  If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to or faster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans.  Our pension cost and the required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use to measure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value.  We could experience increased pension cost due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets. Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension cost in future years and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.  Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.  We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters. As of December 31, 2013, we employed approximately 47,900 persons worldwide.  Approximately 15,650 of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2014 and 2016.  While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages or other labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts with labor unions or our employees.  Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce.  In addition, many of our customers and suppliers have unionized work forces.  Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. 23Table of ContentsOur financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position. Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which are periodically revised and/or expanded.  Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board.  Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures.  The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports on Form 10-K and Form 10-Q.  An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed.  It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position"
14,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2013-02-20,"ITEM 1A.Â Â Â Â Risk Factors
     Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertaintiesthat could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effecton our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report,including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDINGFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.  A sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The global economy continued to slow throughout 2012 as we experienced declining demand in emerging markets, including Brazil andChina, and a decline in India as the result of foreign currency fluctuations. The developed economies, including the U.S. economy, experienced slowing demand as the year progressed and continued toexperience economic uncertainty driven by unresolved federal tax and budget issues, while Europe continued to struggle as the result of lingering high unemployment, concerns over European sovereigndebt issues and the tightening of government budgets. If the global economy or some of our significant markets encounter a sustained slowdown or our emerging markets, particularly China and Brazil,don't recover to stronger growth rates; depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a slowdown, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly bematerially adversely affected. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtfulaccounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses.  A slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years, especially in the emerging markets of Chinaand Brazil. In 2012, infrastructure spending in emerging markets steadily declined throughout the year. General weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuiltcould lead to a further decline in infrastructure spending. Any sustained downturns in infrastructure development that result from these or other circumstances could adversely affect our business.  Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards by multiple jurisdictions around the world could adverselyaffect our business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed bythe EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capitaland research expenditures to comply with these emission standards. Developing engines to meet numerous changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emissionrequirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases,we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emission. While we have met previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existingand future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. The successful developmentand introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such 20 Table of Contentsasdelays in product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Inaddition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards around the world is unpredictable and subjectto change, or delays which could result in the products we developed or modified to comply with these standards becoming unnecessary or becoming necessary later than expected and in some casesnegating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return on capital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adverselyaffect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines.  We derive significant income from investees that we do not directly control.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2012, werecognized $384Â million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $416Â million in 2011. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investees isfrom our 11 unconsolidated North American distributors and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company,Â Ltd. (DCEC) and Chongqing Cummins EngineCompany,Â Ltd. (CCEC). Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors generally range from 30Â percent to 50Â percent. We have 50Â percentequity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control theirmanagement or their operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities. A significant reduction in the level of contributionby these entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our truck manufacturers and original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB, Navistar International Corporation and Chrysler, are truck manufacturersor OEMsÂ that manufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engineproduction to us due to the quality of our engine products, our emission capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire foreliminating production risks and their desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engineproduction in the future. Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of anotherengine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significantreduction in the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  A downturn in the North American truck industry or other factors negatively affecting any of our truck OEM customers could materially adversely impact our results ofoperations.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We make significant sales of engines and components to a few large truck OEMsÂ in North America. If the North American truckmarket suffers a significant downturn, or if one of our large truck OEM customers experienced financial distress or bankruptcy, such circumstance would likely lead to significant reductions in ourrevenues and earnings, commercial disputes, receivable collection issues, and other negative consequences that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 21 Table of Contents The discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition andcash flow.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The EPA and CARB have certified all of our 2012/2013 on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize SCRtechnology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platforms in 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engineplatforms impacta number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America. While these 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field, the discovery of any significant problems inthese platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk, and could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition andcash flow.  We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject tocurrency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S.dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter intofinancial transactions that attempt to address these risks and many of our supply agreements with customers include currency exchange rate adjustment provisions, there can be no assurance thatcurrency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adversefluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Wealso face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars orto remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of fundsdenominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â During 2012, we single sourced approximately 60 to 70Â percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay inour suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused byfactors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers'allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products toour customers and our results of operations.  Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material andcommodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around theworld may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions and contractual pricing adjustment provisions with our customers that attempt toaddress some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations.In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide 22 Table of Contentsuswith some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As aresult, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.  Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation,loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through aformal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations, financial condition and cash flows.  We face significant competition in the markets we serve.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors thatproduce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline, natural gas andother technologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily competeon the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, quality and customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and longstanding relationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets.For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see ""Operating Segments"" in ""ItemÂ 1 Business.""  Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products toother countries. This has meant greater demand for our advanced engine technologies to help these customers meet the more stringent emissions requirements of developed markets, as well as greaterdemand for access to our distribution systems for purposes of equipment servicing. As these emerging market customers enter into and begin to compete in more developed markets, they may increasinglybegin to compete with our existing customers in these markets. Our further aid to emerging market customers could adversely affect our relationships with developed market customers and, as a result,we may be pressured to restrict sale or support of some of our products in the areas of increased competition. In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth indemand, we may see little or no benefit from this type of expansion by our emerging market customers.  We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Approximately 53Â percent of our net sales for 2012 and 59Â percent in 2011 were attributable to customers outside the U.S.Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risks include:Âthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;  Âtrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; 23 Table of ContentsÂthe imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;  Âthe imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; Âdifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;  Ârequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and  Âchanges in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Aswe continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be noassurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.  Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect ourprofitability.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability inthe future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,changes to our assertions regarding permanent re-investment of our foreign earnings, changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparationprocess. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing taxaudits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positionstaken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amountsultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a materialimpact on our tax provision.  We are exposed to risks arising from the price and availability of energy.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The level of demand for our products and services is influenced in multiple ways by the price and availability of energy. High energycosts generally drive greater demand for better fuel economy in almost all countries in which we operate. Some of our engine products have been developed with a primary purpose of offering fueleconomy improvements, and if energy costs decrease or increase less than expected, demand for these products may likewise decrease. The relative unavailability of electricity in some emerging marketcountries also influences demand for our electricity generating products, such as our diesel generators. If these countries add energy capacity by expanding their power grids at a rate equal to orfaster than the growth in demand for energy, the demand for our generating products could also decrease or increase less than would otherwise be the case.  Our global operations are subject to laws and regulations that impose significant compliance costs and create reputational and legal risk.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of commercial and trade regulations around theworld. Recent years have seen an increase in the development and enforcement of laws regarding trade compliance and anti-corruption such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act andsimilar laws from other countries. Our numerous foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are governed by laws, rules and business practices that 24 Table of Contentsdifferfrom those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or business practices or our Code of Business Conduct. Violations of these laws may result in severecriminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. We cannot predict the nature,scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.  We face the challenge of accurately aligning our capacity with our demand.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We can experience capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products in times of growing demand while we can alsoexperience idle capacity as economies slow or demand for certain products decline. Accurately forecasting our expected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity have been, and will continue tobe, important factors in determining our results of operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which couldprevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business. However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and wemay experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform tospecification results or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coveragewith respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverageagainst product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time,regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, even if we are successful in defendingagainst a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.  We may need to write off significant investments in our new North American light-duty diesel engine platform if customer commitments further deteriorate.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We began development of a new North American light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety ofon- and off-highway applications. Since that time, and as of DecemberÂ 31, 2012, we have capitalized investments of approximately $233Â million. Market uncertaintydue to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remain active. If customer expectations or volume projections further deterioratefrom our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value.  Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which weoperate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believethat we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims withrespect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either 25 Table of Contentspresentlaws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substancesoccurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amountof such liability could be material.  Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations,financial condition and cash flow.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension expense andthe required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use tomeasure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experienceincreased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relatingto the expected return on plan assets. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Significantdeclines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension expense in futureyears and adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligatedto make pension payments in the U.S. and perhaps other countries and these contributions could be material.  We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As of DecemberÂ 31, 2012, we employed approximately 46,000 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,750 of our employees worldwide arerepresented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2013 and 2015. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages orother labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types ofconflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customersand suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow.  Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(GAAP), which are periodically revisedand/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting StandardsBoard. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognition and lease accounting as well as toissue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual and quarterly reports onFormÂ 10-K and FormÂ 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposure process and, therefore,their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment thatwe apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position. 26 Table of Contents"

     Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertaintiesthat could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually, or in combination, have a material adverse effecton our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report,including statements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDINGFORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.  Another sustained slowdown or significant downturn in our markets could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows again.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Although emerging markets, notably China, India and Brazil, experienced strong growth and certain domestic markets showed more robustrecoveries in 2011, the global economy remains fragile. Growth rates in certain emerging markets, including China and India, began to slow in the second half of 2011 as governments looked to controlinflation through tight monetary policies, while in the developed economies, particularly in Europe, the recovery remains sluggish due to the unwinding of fiscal stimuli, lingering high unemployment,concerns over European sovereign debt issues and the tightening of government budgets. As a result, further disruptions in Europe or in other economies could affect our revenues or liquidity.Continued inflationary pressures in emerging market countries could cause their governments to further tighten credit and raise interest rates, resulting in slowing economic growth. If the globaleconomy, or some of our significant markets, were to undergo a sustained slowdown or another significant downturn, depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a slowdown or downturn, ourresults of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affected again. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to considerfurther restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days sales outstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of ourbusinesses.  A slowdown in infrastructure development could adversely affect our business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Infrastructure development has been a significant driver of our business in recent years. Some governments and financial institutionshave tightened credit availability and made the terms of available credit more onerous, which may lead to a slowdown in economic growth and infrastructure spending. Concern over inflationary or othereconomic pressures may cause governments or financial institutions to take similar measures in the future. General weakness in economic growth or the perception that infrastructure has been overbuiltalso may lead to a decrease in infrastructure spending. Any significant declines in infrastructure development that result from these circumstances could adversely affect our business.  Unpredictability in the adoption, implementation and enforcement of increasingly stringent emission standards could adversely affect our business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed bythe EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies (such as the CARB) and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capitaland research expenditures to comply with these emission standards. Developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emissionrequirements, makes developingengines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in 19 Table of Contentscertainmarkets. In some cases, we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emission. For example, we were required to develop newengines to comply with stringent emission standards in the U.S. by JanuaryÂ 1, 2010, including the reduction of NOx emission to near zero levels, among other requirements. While we were able tomeet this and previous deadlines, our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. Thesuccessful development and introduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, costover-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties. In addition to these risks, the nature and timing of government implementation and enforcement of increasinglystringent emission standards around the world is unpredictable and subject to change, delays and reversals that can result in new or modified products that we have developed to comply with thestandards becoming unnecessary, or becoming necessary later than expected, and in some cases negating our competitive advantage. This in turn can delay, diminish or eliminate the expected return oncapital and research expenditures that we have invested in such products and may adversely affect our perceived competitive advantage in being an early, advanced developer of compliant engines.  We rely on income from investees that we do not directly control.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2011, werecognized $ 416Â million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $ 351Â million in 2010. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investeescomes from our 12 unconsolidated North American distributors and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company,Â Ltd. (""DCEC"") and Chongqing Cummins EngineCompany,Â Ltd. (""CCEC""). Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors generally range from 30Â percent to 50Â percent. We have 50Â percentequity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control theirmanagement or operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution bythese entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Several of our engine customers, including PACCAR, Volvo AB and Chrysler, are truck manufacturers or OEMsÂ that manufactureengines for some of their own products. Despite their own engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to thequality of our engine products, our emission capabilities, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks andtheir desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the future. Increasedlevels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another engine manufacturer, the inabilityof third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engineproduction outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. 20 Table of Contents The discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition andcash flows.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) have certified all of our 2011on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platformsin 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America.While these 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field, the discovery of any significant problems in these platforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs,reputational risk and brand risk.  We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject tocurrency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, sinceour financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our resultsof operations. While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affectour results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currencyexchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Wealso face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars orto remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of fundsdenominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  Another downturn in the North American and European automotive industries could adversely impact our business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â During the recession, lower production levels for some of our key suppliers, increases in certain raw material, commodity and energycosts and the global credit market crisis resulted in severe financial distress among many companies within the automotive supply base. A return to financial distress within the automotive industryand our shared supply base and/or the subsequent bankruptcy of one or more automakers may lead to further supplier bankruptcies, commercial disputes, supply chain interruptions, supplier requests forcompany sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain.  We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â During 2011, we single sourced approximately 60 to 70Â percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay inour suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused byfactors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers'allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies, natural disasters or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products toour customers. 21 Table of Contents Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of material andcommodity market price increases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around theworld may offset our efforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions that attempt to address some of these risks (notably with respect to copper, platinumand palladium), there can be no assurance that commodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. In addition, while the use ofcommodity price hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that mightresult from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result, higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in decliningmargins.  Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation,loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through aformal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue. Any significant product recalls could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations, financial condition and cash flows.  We face significant competition in the markets we serve.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors thatproduce and sell similar products.

Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, qualityand customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standingrelationships with participants in these markets. There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets. For a morecomplete discussion of the competitive environment in which each of our segments operates, see ""Operating Segments"" in ""ItemÂ 1 Business.""  Increasing global competition among our customers may affect our existing customer relationships and restrict our ability to benefit from some of our customers' growth.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As our customers in emerging markets continue to grow in size and scope, they are increasingly seeking to export their products toother countries.

In addition, to the extent the competition does not correspond to overall growth in demand, we may see little or no benefit fromthis type of expansion by our emerging market customers. 22 Table of Contents We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Approximately 59Â percent of our net sales for 2011 were attributable to customers outside the U.S., compared to64Â percent in 2010. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risksinclude:Âthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;  Âtrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; Âthe imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;  Âthe imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions; Âdifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;  Ârequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and  Âchanges in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets.

Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Several of our foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are located outside the U.S. with laws, rules and businesspractices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or customs or our Code of Business Conduct and actions by these entities may cause us legalor reputational risk if they violate applicable laws, rules or business practices.

Since that time, and as of DecemberÂ 31, 2011, we have capitalized investments of approximately $221Â million. Market uncertaintydue to the global recession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remain active. If customer expectations or volume projections further deterioratefrom our current expected levels and we do not identify new customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value.  Our operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which weoperate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believethat we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims withrespect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either 24 Table of Contentspresentlaws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substancesoccurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amountof such liability could be material.  Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations,financial condition and cash flows.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension expense andthe required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use tomeasure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value. We could experienceincreased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate and changes in our assumptions relatingto the expected return on plan assets. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Significantdeclines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension expense in futureyears and adverse changes to our financial condition. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S.and perhaps other countries, and these contributions could be material.  We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As of DecemberÂ 31, 2011, we employed approximately 43,900 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,700 of our employees worldwide arerepresented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2012 and 2015. While we have no reason to believe that we will be materially impacted by work stoppages orother labor matters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types ofconflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customersand suppliers have unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have amaterial adverse effect on our operations.  Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America(GAAP), which are periodically revised and/or expanded. Accordingly, from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards issued by recognized authoritative bodies, includingthe Financial Accounting Standards Board. Recently, accounting standard setters issued new guidance which further interprets or seeks to revise accounting pronouncements related to revenue recognitionand lease accounting as well as to issue new standards expanding disclosures. The impact of accounting pronouncements that have been issued but not yet implemented is disclosed in our annual andquarterly reports on FormÂ 10-K and FormÂ 10-Q. An assessment of proposed standards is not provided, as such proposals are subject to change through the exposureprocess and, therefore, their effects on our financial statements cannot be meaningfully assessed. It is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the currentaccounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on the reported results of operations and financial position. 25   Table of Contents"

     Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertaintiesthat could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report and could individually or combined have a material adverse effect on ourresults of operations, financial position and cash flows. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report, includingstatements related to markets for our products and trends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate section above, ""CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKINGINFORMATION,"" should be considered in addition to the following statements.  The discovery of any significant problems with our new engine platforms in North America could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition andcash flows.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and California Air Resources Board (CARB) have certified all of our 2011on-highway and off-highway engines, which utilize selective catalytic reduction (SCR) technology to meet requisite emission levels. We introduced SCR technology into our engine platformsin 2010. The effective performance of SCR technology and the overall performance of these engine platforms impact a number of our operating segments and remain crucial to our success in North America.While the model year 2010 engine platforms have performed well in the field and the 2011 model year engines have undergone extensive testing, the discovery of any significant problems in theseplatforms could result in recall campaigns, increased warranty costs, reputational risk and brand risk.  Another downturn in our markets could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows again.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Although the emerging markets, including China, India and Brazil, recovered in 2010, the global economy remains fragile, with NorthAmerica and other developed countries continuing to experience sluggish results and certain countries in Europe experiencing a debt crisis. If the global economy were to take another significantdownturn, depending upon the length, duration and severity of such a downturn, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flow would almost certainly be materially adversely affectedagain. Specifically, our revenues would likely decrease, we may be forced to consider further restructuring actions, we may need to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts, our days salesoutstanding may increase and we could experience impairments to assets of certain of our businesses.  Another downturn in the North American and European automotive industries could adversely impact our business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â A number of companies in the global automotive industry have experienced significant financial difficulties in recent years. In NorthAmerica, General Motors Corporation (""GM""), Ford Motor Company and Chrysler Group,Â LLC (""Chrysler"") experienced declining markets; furthermore, GM and Chrysler previously filed for, and thenexited, bankruptcy under ChapterÂ 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code and accepted substantial monetary infusions from the U.S. government. Automakers across Europe and Japan also experienceddifficulties from a weakened economy and tightening credit 17 Table of Contentsmarkets.Because many of our suppliers also supply automotive industry participants, the difficult automotive industry conditions also adversely affected our supply base. During the recession, lowerproduction levels for some of our key suppliers, increases in certain raw material, commodity and energy costs and the global credit market crisis resulted in severe financial distress among manycompanies within the automotive supply base. A return to financial distress within the automotive industry and our shared supply base and/or the subsequent bankruptcy of one or more additionalautomakers may lead to further supplier bankruptcies, commercial disputes, supply chain interruptions, supplier requests for company sponsored capital support or a collapse of the supply chain.  We rely on income from investees that we do not directly control.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our net income includes significant equity, royalty and interest income from investees that we do not directly control. For 2010, werecognized $351Â million of equity, royalty and interest income from investees, compared to $214Â million in 2009. The majority of our equity, royalty and interest income from investeescomes from our 12 unconsolidated North American distributors, and from two of our joint ventures in China, Dongfeng Cummins Engine Company,Â Ltd. (""DCEC"") and Chongqing Cummins EngineCompany,Â Ltd. (""CCEC""). Our equity ownership interests in our unconsolidated North American distributors generally range from 30Â percent to 50Â percent. We have 50Â percentequity ownership interests in DCEC and CCEC. As a result, although a significant percentage of our net income is derived from these unconsolidated entities, we do not unilaterally control theirmanagement or operations, which puts a substantial portion of our net income at risk from the actions or inactions of these other entities. A significant reduction in the level of contribution bythese entities to our net income would likely have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Government regulation could adversely affect our business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our engines are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory requirements governing emission and noise, including standards imposed bythe EPA, the European Union, state regulatory agencies, such as the CARB and other regulatory agencies around the world. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant capital andresearch expenditures to comply with these regulatory standards. Developing engines to meet changing government regulatory requirements, with different implementation timelines and emissionrequirements, makes developing engines efficiently for multiple markets complicated and could result in substantial additional costs that may be difficult to recover in certain markets. In some cases,we may be required to develop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to air emission. For example, we were required to develop new engines to comply with stringentemission standards in the U.S. by JanuaryÂ 1, 2010, including the reduction of NOx emission to near zero levels, among other requirements. While we were able to meet this and previous deadlines,our ability to comply with other existing and future regulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in the engine markets we serve. Further, the successful development andintroduction of new and enhanced products in order to comply with new regulatory requirements are subject to other risks, such as delays in product development, cost over-runs andunanticipated technical and manufacturing difficulties.  Our truck manufacturers and OEM customers may not continue to outsource their engine supply needs.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Several of our engine customers, including PACCARÂ Inc., Volvo AB and Chrysler, are truck manufacturers or OEMsÂ thatmanufacture engines for some of their own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have historically chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due tothe quality of our engine products, our emission capability, our systems integration, their customers' preferences, their desire for cost reductions, their desire for eliminating production risks andtheir desire to maintain company focus. However, there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to outsource, or outsource as much of, their engine production in the 18 Table of Contentsfuture.Increased levels of OEM vertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts in our customers' business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another enginemanufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reductionin the level of engine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our products are exposed to variability in material and commodity costs.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our businesses establish prices with our customers in accordance with contractual time frames; however, the timing of market priceincreases may prevent us from passing these additional costs on to our customers through timely pricing actions. Additionally, higher material and commodity costs around the world may offset ourefforts to reduce our cost structure. While we customarily enter into financial transactions to address some of these risks (i.e.Â copper, platinum and palladium), there can be no assurance thatcommodity price fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, while the use of commodity price hedging instruments may provide uswith protection from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in price. As a result,higher material and commodity costs, as well as hedging these commodity costs during periods of decreasing prices, could result in declining margins.  We are subject to currency exchange rate and other related risks.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We conduct operations in many areas of the world involving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subject tocurrency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since our financial statements are denominated in U.S.dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and will continue to have, an impact on our results of operations. While we customarily enter intofinancial transactions to address these risks, there can be no assurance that currency exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cashflows. In addition, while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentiallyforego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Wealso face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars orto remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of fundsdenominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.  We are vulnerable to supply shortages from single-sourced suppliers.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â During 2010, we single sourced approximately 60 to 70Â percent of the total types of parts in our product designs. Any delay inour suppliers' deliveries may adversely affect our operations at multiple manufacturing locations, forcing us to seek alternative supply sources to avoid serious disruptions. Delays may be caused byfactors affecting our suppliers, including capacity constraints, labor disputes, economic downturns, availability of credit, the impaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliers'allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any extended delay in receiving critical supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to our customers. 19 Table of Contents Our products are subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our products may be subject to recall for performance or safety-related issues. Product recalls subject us to harm to our reputation,loss of current and future customers, reduced revenue and product recall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, either voluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through aformal campaign to solicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue.  We face significant competition in the markets we serve.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors thatproduce and sell similar products. We primarily compete in the market with diesel engines and related diesel products; however, new technologies continue to be developed for gasoline and othertechnologies and we will continue to face new competition from these expanding technologies. Our products primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy, speed of delivery, qualityand customer support. We also face competitors in some emerging markets who have established local practices and long standing relationships with participants in these markets. There can be noassurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with the products of other companies and in other markets. For a more complete discussion of the competitive environment in which eachof our segments operates, see ""Operating Segments"" in ""ItemÂ 1 Business.""  We are exposed to political, economic and other risks that arise from operating a multinational business.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Approximately 64Â percent of our net sales for 2010 were attributable to customers outside the U.S., compared to52Â percent in 2009. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic and other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. These risksinclude: Âthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;  Âtrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;   Âthe imposition of taxes on foreign income and tax rates in certain foreign countries that exceed those in the U.S.;  Âthe imposition of tariffs, exchange controls or other restrictions;   Âdifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations;  Ârequired compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations; and   Âchanges in general economic and political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Aswe continue to operate our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other related risks. There can be noassurance that the consequences of these and other factors relating to our multinational operations will not have a material adverse effect upon us.  Significant declines in future financial and stock market conditions could diminish our pension plan asset performance and adversely impact our results of operations,financial condition and cash flows.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We sponsor both funded and unfunded domestic and foreign defined benefit pension and other retirement plans. Our pension expense andthe required contributions to our pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions we use tomeasure our defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a 20 Table of Contentspresentvalue. We could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate andchanges in our assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Significantdeclines in future financial and stock market conditions could cause material losses in our pension plan assets, which could result in increased pension expense in futureyears and adverse changes to our financial condition. Depending upon the severity of market declines and government regulatory changes, we may be legally obligated to make pension payments in the U.S.and perhaps other countries, and these contributions could be material.  We face reputational and legal risk from operation outside the U.S. and affiliations with joint venture partners  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Several of our foreign subsidiaries, affiliates and joint venture partners are located outside the U.S. with laws, rules and businesspractices that differ from those of the U.S. The activities of these entities may not comply with U.S. laws or customs or our Code of Business Conduct and actions by these entities may cause us legalor reputational risk if they violate applicable laws, rules or business practices.  We face the challenge of increasing our capacity and ramping up our production at the appropriate pace as we exit the downturn.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Prior to the recession, we experienced capacity constraints and longer lead times for certain products. Accurately forecasting ourexpected volumes and appropriately adjusting our capacity as we exit the downturn have been, and will continue to be, important factors in determining our results of operations. We cannot guaranteethat we will be able to increase manufacturing capacity to a level that meets demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and could harm our business.However, if we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity, we may have significantly underutilized assets and we may experience reduced margins. If we do not accurately align our manufacturingcapabilities with demand it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Our business is exposed to risks of product liability claims.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that our products' failure to perform tospecification results, or is alleged to result in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coveragewith respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequate coverageagainst product liability claims. In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant periods of time,regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a significant product liability claim could have a material adverse effect upon us. In addition, even if we are successful in defendingagainst a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products and us.  We may need to write off significant investments in our new light-duty diesel engine platforms if customer commitments further deteriorate.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We began development of a new light-duty diesel engine platform in July 2006 to be used in a variety of on- andoff-highway applications. Since that time, and as of DecemberÂ 31, 2010, we have capitalized investments of approximately $218Â million. Market uncertainty due to the globalrecession resulted in some customers delaying or cancelling their vehicle programs, while others remain active. If customer expectations or volume projections further deteriorate from our currentlevels and we do not 21 Table of Contentsidentifynew customers, we may need to recognize an impairment charge and write the assets down to net realizable value.  Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Our plants and operations are subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in which weoperate, including laws and regulations governing air emission, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believethat we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmental laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we will not be adversely impacted by costs, liabilities or claims withrespect to existing or subsequently acquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring thecleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or another location where we have disposed ofhazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination and the amount of such liability could be material.  Unanticipated changes in our effective tax rate, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect ourprofitability.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous international jurisdictions. Our income tax provision and cash tax liability inthe future could be adversely affected by changes in the distribution of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities,changes in tax laws and the discovery of new information in the course of our tax return preparation process. The carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., isdependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may requirean extended period of time to resolve and can be highly judgmental. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us.We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of these or subsequent tax auditscould be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision.  We may be adversely impacted by work stoppages and other labor matters.  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â As of DecemberÂ 31, 2010, we employed approximately 39,200 persons worldwide. Approximately 15,500 of our employees worldwide arerepresented by various unions under collective bargaining agreements that expire between 2011 and 2015. While we have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppages and other labormatters, there can be no assurance that future issues with our labor unions will be resolved favorably or that we will not encounter future strikes, work stoppages, or other types of conflicts withlabor unions or our employees. Any of these consequences may have an adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of our customers and suppliershave unionized work forces. Work stoppages or slow-downs experienced by our customers or suppliers could result in slow-downs or closures that would have a material adverseeffect on our operations. 22 Table of Contents  Our financial statements are subject to changes in accounting standards that could adversely impact our profitability or financial position.

13,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2007-02-27,"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  RiskFactors Relating to Our BusinessSet forth below andelsewhere in this Annual Report on FormÂ 10-K are some of theprincipal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business resultsto differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in thisReport. In addition, future results could be materially affected by generalindustry and market conditions, changes in laws or accounting rules, generalU.S. and non-U.S. economic and political conditions, including a globaleconomic slow-down, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates,terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instabilityor major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expectedeconomic and business conditions. These risk factors should be considered inaddition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements inthis Report, including statements related to markets for our products andtrends in our business that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Ourseparate section in Item 7 below, ÂDisclosure Regarding Forward-LookingStatements,Â should be considered in addition to the following statements.Our business is affected by the cyclical nature of themarkets we serve.Our financial performancedepends, in large part, on varying conditions in the markets and geographiesthat we serve. Demand in these markets and geographies fluctuates in responseto overall economic conditions and is particularly sensitive to changes ininterest rate levels. Our sales are also impacted by OEM inventory levels andproduction schedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in the markets we servegenerally result in reductions in sales and pricing of our products, whichcould reduce future earnings and cash flow.Our products are subject to substantial governmentregulation.Our engines are subject to extensive statutory andregulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standardsimposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies, such as the CARB, and otherregulatory agencies around the world. In some cases, we may be required to developnew products to comply with new regulations, particularly those relating to airemissions. For example, we were required to develop new engines to comply withstringent emissions standards by JanuaryÂ 1, 2007. While we were able tomeet this deadline, our ability to comply with other existing and futureregulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in theengine markets we serve. Currently, we believe we are on schedule to meet alldeadlines for known future regulatory standards.We have made, and will berequired to continue to make, significant capital and research expenditures tocomply with these regulatory standards. Further, the successful development andintroduction of new and enhanced products are subject to risks, such as delaysin product development, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical andmanufacturing difficulties. Any failure to comply with regulatory standardsaffecting our products could subject us to fines or penalties, and couldrequire us to cease production of any non-compliant engine or to recall anyengines produced and sold in violation of the applicable 20 standards.See ÂBusinessÂEnvironmental ComplianceÂProduct Environmental ComplianceÂ for acomplete discussion of the environmental laws and regulations that affect ourproducts.Our products are subject to recall for performancerelated issues.We are at risk for productrecall costs. Product recall costs are incurred when we decide, eithervoluntarily or involuntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign tosolicit the return of specific products due to a known or suspected performanceissue. Costs typically include the cost of the product, part or component beingreplaced, customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace the defectivepart or component. When a recall decision is made, we estimate the cost of therecall and record a charge to earnings in that period in accordance with FASBStatement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.Â 5,Â  ÂAccountingfor Contingencies.ÂÂ  In making this estimate, judgment is required as tothe quantity or volume to be recalled, the total cost of the recall campaign,the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and, insome cases, the extent to which the supplier of the part or component willshare in the recall cost. As a result, these estimates are subject to change.We cannot assure that our truck manufacturers and OEMcustomers will continue to outsource their engine supply needs.Several of our enginecustomers, including Paccar, Navistar, Volvo and DaimlerChrysler, are truckmanufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines for some of their own products.Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customers have chosen tooutsource certain types of engine production to us due to the quality of ourengine products, our emissions capability, systems integration, their customerÂspreference and in order to reduce costs, eliminate production risks andmaintain company focus. However, we cannot assure that these customers willcontinue to outsource engine production in the future. Increased levels of OEMvertical integration could result from a number of factors, such as shifts inour customersÂ business strategies, acquisition by a customer of another enginemanufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliers to meet productspecifications and the emergence of low-cost production opportunities inforeign countries. Any significant reduction in the level of engine productionoutsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customers could significantlyimpact our revenues and, accordingly, have a material adverse affect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.Our largest customer accounts for a significant shareof our business.Sales to DaimlerChrysleraccounted for approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2006,primarily relating to sales of our ISB engine for use in the Dodge Ram truckand sales of our heavy-and medium-duty truck engines to its Freightlinerdivision. While a significant amount of our sales to DaimlerChrysler are underlong-term supply agreements, these agreements provide for the supply ofDaimlerChryslerÂs engine requirements for particular models and not a specificnumber of engines. Accordingly, the loss of DaimlerChrysler as a customer or asignificant decline in the production levels for the vehicles in whichDaimlerChrysler uses our products would have an adverse effect on our business,results of operations and financial condition.Our manufacturing operations are dependent uponthird-party suppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages.We obtain materials andmanufactured components from third-party suppliers. A significant number of oursuppliers representing 75 to 85 percent of our total raw material and componentpurchasers in 2006 are the sole source for a particular supply item, althoughthe majority of these materials and components can be obtained from othersuppliers. Any delay in our suppliersÂ abilities to provide us with necessarymaterials and components may affect our capabilities at a number of ourmanufacturing locations, or may require us to seek alternative supply sources.Delays in obtaining supplies may result from a number of 21 factorsaffecting our suppliers including capacity constraints, labor disputes, theimpaired financial condition of a particular supplier, suppliersÂ allocationsto other purchasers, weather emergencies or acts of war or terrorism. Any delayin receiving supplies could impair our ability to deliver products to ourcustomers and, accordingly, could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, results of operations and financial condition.We may be adversely impacted by work stoppagesÂ andother labor matters.As of DecemberÂ 31,2006, we employed approximately 34,600 persons worldwide. Approximately 13,500of our employees worldwide are represented by various unions under collectivebargaining agreements with various unions that expire between 2007 and 2011. Whilewe have no reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppagesÂ andother labor matters, we cannot assure that future issues with our labor unionswill be resolved favorably or that we will notencounterÂ futureÂ strikes, further unionization efforts or other typesof conflicts with labor unions or our employees. Any of these factors may havean adverse effect on us or may limit our flexibility in dealing with ourworkforce. In addition, many of our customers have unionized work forces. WorkstoppagesÂ or slow-downs experienced by our customers could result inslow-downs or closures at vehicle assembly plants where our engines areinstalled. If one or more of our customers experience a material work stoppage,it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operationsand financial condition.Our products involve risks of exposure to productliability claims.We face an inherentbusiness risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that ourproductsÂ failure to perform to specifications results, or is alleged to result,in property damage, bodily injury and/or death. We may experience materialproduct liability losses in the future. While we maintain insurance coveragewith respect to certain product liability claims, we may not be able to obtainsuch insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, and any suchinsurance may not provide adequate coverage against product liability claims.In addition, product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divertthe attention of management and other personnel for significant periods oftime, regardless of the ultimate outcome. An unsuccessful defense of a productliability claim could have a material adverse affect on our business, resultsof operations and financial condition and cash flows. In addition, even if weare successful in defending against a claim relating to our products, claims ofthis nature could cause our customers to lose confidence in our products andus.Our operations are subject to extensive environmentallaws and regulations.Our plants and operationsare subject to increasingly stringent environmental laws and regulations in allof the countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations governingemissions to air, discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage,transportation, treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believethat we are in compliance in all material respects with these environmentallaws and regulations, we cannot assure that we will not be adversely impactedby costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequentlyacquired operations, under either present laws and regulations or those thatmay be adopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiringthe cleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substancesoccurs at or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill oranother location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be heldliable for the contamination, and the amount of such liability could bematerial.22 We are exposed to political, economic and other risksthat arise from operating a multinational business.Approximately 50percent of our net sales for 2006 were attributable to customers outside theUnited States. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economicand other risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries. Theserisks include:Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  the difficulty of enforcingagreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems;Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  trade protection measuresand import or export licensing requirements;Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  tax rates in certainforeign countries that exceed those in the UnitedÂ States and theimposition of withholding requirements on foreign earnings;Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  the imposition of tariffs,exchange controls or other restrictions;Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  difficulty in staffing andmanaging widespread operations and the application of foreign laborregulations;Â·Â Â Â Â Â Â  required compliance with avariety of foreign laws and regulations; andÂ·Â Â Â Â Â Â  changes in general economicand political conditions in countries where we operate, particularly inemerging markets.As we continue to expandour business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability toanticipate and effectively manage these and other risks. We cannot assure thatthese and other factors will not have a material adverse affect on ourinternational operations or on our business as a whole.We are subject to currency exchange rate and otherrelated risks.We conduct operations in many areas of the worldinvolving transactions denominated in a variety of currencies. We are subjectto currency exchange rate risk to the extent that our costs are denominated incurrencies other than those in which we earn revenues. In addition, since ourfinancial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currencyexchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies have had, and willcontinue to have, an impact on our earnings. While we customarily enter intofinancial transactions to address these risks, we cannot assure that currencyexchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our results of operationsand financial condition. In addition, while the use of currency hedginginstruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations incurrency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially foregothe benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchangerates.We also face risks arisingfrom the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchangecontrols may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollarsor to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries orbusinesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currencydevaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currencyof the country instituting the devaluation. Actions of this nature, if theyoccur or continue for significant periods of time, could have an adverse effecton our results of operations and financial condition in any given period.We face significant competition in the markets weserve.The markets in which weoperate are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of othermanufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. Ourproducts primarily compete on the basis of price, performance, fuel economy,speed of delivery, quality and customer support. There can be no assurance thatour products will be able to compete successfully with the products of theseother companies. Any failure by us to compete effectively in the markets weserve could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.

15,CMI,CUMMINS INC,2006-02-28,"Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  RiskFactors Relating to Our BusinessSet forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report onFormÂ 10-K are some of the principal risks and uncertainties thatcould cause our actual business results to differ materially from anyforward-looking statements contained in this Report. In addition, futureresults could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions,changes in laws or accounting rules, general U.S. and non-U.S. economic andpolitical conditions, including a global economic slow-down, fluctuation ofinterest rates or currency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest orinternational conflicts, political instability or major health concerns,natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic and businessconditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to ourcautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Report,including statements related to markets for our products and trends in ourbusiness that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Our separate sectionin Item 7 below, ÂDisclosure Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,Â should beconsidered in addition to the following statements.Our business is affected by the cyclical nature of themarkets we serve.Our financial performance depends, in large part, onvarying conditions in the markets and geographies that we serve. Demand inthese markets and geographies fluctuates in response to overall economicconditions and is particularly sensitive to changes in interest rate levels andfuel costs. Our sales are also impacted by OEM inventory levels and productionschedules and stoppages. Economic downturns in the markets we serve generallyresult in reductions in sales and pricing of our products, which could reducefuture earnings and cash flow.Our products are subject to substantial governmentregulation.Our engines are subject to extensive statutory andregulatory requirements governing emissions and noise, including standardsimposed by the EPA, state regulatory agencies, such as the CARB, and otherregulatory agencies around the world. In some cases, we may be required todevelop new products to comply with new regulations, particularly thoserelating to air emissions. For example, under the terms of a consent decreethat we and a number of other engine manufacturers entered into with the DOJ,the CARB and the EPA, we were required to develop new engines to comply withstringent emissions standards by OctoberÂ 1, 2002. While we were able tomeet this deadline, our ability to comply with other existing and futureregulatory standards will be essential for us to maintain our position in theengine markets we serve. Currently, we believe we are on schedule to meet alldeadlines for known future regulatory standards.We have made, and will be required to continue tomake, significant capital and research expenditures to comply with theseregulatory standards. Further, the successful development and introduction ofnew and enhanced products are subject to risks, such as delays in productdevelopment, cost over-runs and unanticipated technical and manufacturingdifficulties. Any failure to comply with regulatory standards affecting ourproducts could subject us to fines or penalties, and could require us to ceaseproduction of any non-compliant engine or to recall any engines produced andsold in violation of the applicable standards. See ÂBusinessÂEnvironmentalComplianceÂProduct Environmental ComplianceÂ for a complete discussion of theenvironmental laws and regulations that affect our products.19 Our products are subject to recall for performancerelated issues.We are at risk for product recall costs. Productrecall costs are costs incurred when we decide, either voluntarily orinvoluntarily, to recall a product through a formal campaign to solicit thereturn of specific products due to a known or suspected performance issue.Costs typically include the cost of the product, part or component beingreplaced, customer cost of the recall and labor to remove and replace thedefective part or component. When a recall decision is made, we estimate thecost of the recall and record a charge to earnings in that period in accordancewith FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.Â 5,Â  ÂAccountingfor Contingencies.ÂÂ  In making this estimate, judgment is required as tothe quantity or volume to be recalled, the total cost of the recall campaign,the ultimate negotiated sharing of the cost between us and the customer and, insome cases, the extent to which the supplier of the part or component willshare in the recall cost. As a result, these estimates are subject to change.We cannot assure that our truck manufacturers and OEMcustomers will continue to outsource their engine supply needs.Some of our engine customers, including Volvo andDaimlerChrysler, are truck manufacturers or OEMs that manufacture engines fortheir own products. Despite their engine manufacturing abilities, these customershave chosen to outsource certain types of engine production to us due to thequality of our engine products and in order to reduce costs, eliminateproduction risks and maintain company focus. However, we cannot assure thatthese customers will continue to outsource engine production in the future.Increased levels of production insourcing could result from a number offactors, such as shifts in our customersÂ business strategies, acquisition by acustomer of another engine manufacturer, the inability of third-party suppliersto meet product specifications and the emergence of low-cost productionopportunities in foreign countries. Any significant reduction in the level ofengine production outsourcing from our truck manufacturer or OEM customerscould significantly impact our revenues and, accordingly, have a materialadverse affect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our largest customer accounts for a significant shareof our business.Sales to DaimlerChrysler accounted for approximately12 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2005, primarily relating to salesof our ISB engine for use in the Dodge Ram truck and sales of our heavy-andmedium-duty engines to its Freightliner division. While a significant amount ofour sales to DaimlerChrysler are under long-term supply agreements, theseagreements provide for the supply of DaimlerChryslerÂs engine requirements forparticular models and not a specific number of engines. Accordingly, the lossof DaimlerChrysler as a customer or a significant decline in the productionlevels for the vehicles in which DaimlerChrysler uses our products would havean adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.Our manufacturing operations are dependent upon third-partysuppliers, making us vulnerable to supply shortages.We obtain materials and manufactured components fromthird-party suppliers. A significant number of our suppliers representing 75 to85 percent of our total raw material and component purchasers in 2005 are thesole source for a particular supply item, although the majority of thesematerials and components can be obtained from other suppliers. Any delay in oursuppliersÂ abilities to provide us with necessary materials and components mayaffect our capabilities at a number of our manufacturing locations, or mayrequire us to seek alternative supply sources. Delays in obtaining supplies mayresult from a number of factors affecting our suppliers including capacityconstraints, labor disputes, the impaired financial condition of a particularsupplier, suppliersÂ allocations to other purchasers, weather emergencies oracts of war or terrorism. Any delay in receiving supplies could impair ourability to deliver products to our customers and, accordingly, could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.20 We may be adversely impacted by work stoppagesÂ andother labor matters.As of DecemberÂ 31, 2005, we employedapproximately 33,500 persons worldwide. Approximately 12,500 of our employeesworldwide are represented by various unions under collective bargainingagreements with various unions that expire between 2006 and 2010. While we haveno reason to believe that we will be impacted by work stoppagesÂ and otherlabor matters, we cannot assure that future issues with our labor unions willbe resolved favorably or that we will not encounterÂ futureÂ strikes,further unionization efforts or other types of conflicts with labor unions orour employees. Any of these factors may have an adverse effect on us or maylimit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. In addition, many of ourcustomers have unionized work forces. Work stoppagesÂ or slow-downsexperienced by our customers could result in slow-downs or closures at vehicleassembly plants where our engines are installed. If one or more of ourcustomers experience a material work stoppage, it could have a material adverseeffect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our products involve risks of exposure to productliability claims.We face an inherent business risk of exposure toproduct liability claims in the event that our productsÂ failure to perform tospecifications results, or is alleged to result, in property damage, bodily injuryand/or death. We may experience material product liability losses in thefuture. While we maintain insurance coverage with respect to certain productliability claims, we may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptableterms in the future, if at all, and any such insurance may not provide adequatecoverage against product liability claims. In addition, product liabilityclaims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of managementand other personnel for significant periods of time, regardless of the ultimateoutcome. An unsuccessful defense of a product liability claim could have amaterial adverse affect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition and cash flows. In addition, even if we are successful in defendingagainst a claim relating to our products, claims of this nature could cause ourcustomers to lose confidence in our products and our Company.Our operations are subject to extensive environmentallaws and regulations.Our plants and operations are subject to increasinglystringent environmental laws and regulations in all of the countries in whichwe operate, including laws and regulations governing emissions to air,discharges to water and the generation, handling, storage, transportation,treatment and disposal of waste materials. While we believe that we are incompliance in all material respects with these environmental laws andregulations, we cannot assure that we will not be adversely impacted by costs,liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquiredoperations, under either present laws and regulations or those that may beadopted or imposed in the future. We are also subject to laws requiring thecleanup of contaminated property. If a release of hazardous substances occursat or from any of our current or former properties or at a landfill or anotherlocation where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liablefor the contamination, and the amount of such liability could be material.We are exposed to political, economic and other risksthat arise from operating a multinational business.Approximately 51percent of our net sales for 2005 were derived from sources outside the UnitedStates. Accordingly, our business is subject to the political, economic andother risks that are inherent in operating in numerous countries.

In addition, while the use of currency hedginginstruments may provide us with protection from adverse fluctuations incurrency exchange rates, by utilizing these instruments we potentially foregothe benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in currency exchangerates.We also face risks arising from the imposition ofexchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit ourability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividendsand other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in orconducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in adiminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the countryinstituting the devaluation. Actions of this nature, if they occur or continuefor significant periods of time, could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations and financial condition in any given period.We face significant competition in the markets weserve.The markets in which weoperate are highly competitive.
