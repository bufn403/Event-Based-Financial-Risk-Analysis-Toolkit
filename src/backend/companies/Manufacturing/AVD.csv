18,AVD,AMERICAN VANGUARD CORP,2024-03-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSSupply Chain/Regulatory/Geopolitical/Tax RisksDisruption in the global supply chain is creating delays, unavailability and adverse conditions for our industry. Despite improvement in container availability and freight costs, the global supply chain continues to present risk. At present, military activity in the Red Sea is disrupting shipping routes within that region. While not directly affecting the Company, there is no guarantee that this or other supply chain conditions will materially improve any time soon or that the Company will avoid material disruption. Such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods. The regulatory climate remains challenging to the Company’s interests both domestically and internationally. Various agencies within the U.S. (both federal and state) and foreign governments continue to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses (or the expansion of such uses) of many chemistries, including several of the Company’s products and, in some cases, have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses. The challenge of the regulatory climate is more pronounced in certain geographical regions (outside the U.S.) where the Company faces resistance to the continued use of certain of its products. For example, the European Union (“EU”) employs a hazard-based analysis when considering whether product registrations can be maintained; under this approach, EU regulatory authorities typically do not weigh benefit against risk in their assessments and routinely cancel products for which a safer alternative is available, notwithstanding the benefit of the cancelled product. There is no guarantee that this regulatory climate will change in the near term or that the Company will be able to maintain or expand the use of many of its products in the face of such regulatory challenges.Several of the Company’s organophosphates are subject to a petition to revoke tolerances under the FFDCA which, if granted, could result in the limitation and/or cancellation of one or more registrations for such products. Presently, several of the Company’s organophosphate products are under registration review before the USEPA and, at the same time, subject to a petition to revoke tolerances under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (""FFDCA""). The Company continues to provide data and other analysis to USEPA in support of its registrations and in response to that agency’s requests for clarification. Pursuant to a petition filed by NGOs NRDC and PANNA in 2007, USEPA revoked tolerances for chlorpyrifos (an OP not sold by the Company) finding that food residues from that product could not be deemed with reasonable certainty to cause no harm. Consequently, the agency cancelled the registrations for chlorpyrifos. The cancellation was appealed and subsequently overturned by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeal in 2023, which noted that the agency had exceeded its authority in canceling even uses that had been shown to be within applicable safety tolerances. That said, there is no guarantee that USEPA will not make a similar finding with respect to one or more of the Company’s OPs, and that some or all uses of the Company’s OP products could be limited or cancelled. Accordingly, the Company intends to take all action necessary to defend its registrations. Such limitations and/or cancellations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.USEPA has issued a proposed final decision (“PFD”) to cancel PCNB. In mid-2022, the USEPA issued a “proposed final decision” (a variety of agency action theretofore unknown to registrants) to cancel the fungicide PCNB, which is registered by the Company for use on golf courses and potatoes, among other things. The basis for its PFD was the agency’s initial contention that the product is persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (“PBT”). In light of further analysis and Company input, the agency has suggested that the compound may merely have characteristics of a PBT. At any rate, then, the Company must meet a truncated schedule for defending this product, all of which is posted on a public docket. The Company has submitted proposed mitigation measures, and discussion with the program office continues. There is no guarantee that the Company will succeed in persuading USEPA not to cancel the PCNB registration. AMVAC is the sole registrant of PCNB which it manufactures at its own facility. Loss of this product could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance in future reporting periods.9 The Company is dependent upon sole source or a limited number of suppliers for certain of its raw materials and active ingredients. There are a limited number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the Company in a number of its products. Certain of these raw materials are available solely from single or very few sources either domestically or overseas. In connection with supply chain disruptions in 2022 phosphorus and related compounds were increasingly difficult to source for our entire industry; ensuring a continuous supply required extraordinary efforts both with respect to sourcing and production planning. Similarly, in the first half of 2023, DCPA, the active ingredient in one of the Company’s high-margin herbicides, was unavailable from its overseas supplier. There is no guarantee that any of our suppliers will be willing or able to supply products to the Company reliably, continuously and at the levels anticipated by the Company or required by the market. If these sources prove to be unreliable and the Company is not able to supplant or otherwise second source these products, it is possible that the Company will not achieve its projected sales which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.Public statements made by USEPA regarding their preliminary findings in connection with the registration review of the Company’s products could adversely affect product sales and/or commercial viability. Registrations for the Company’s products are subject to registration review by the USEPA from time to time. In the course of the review, the Company submits, and the USEPA reviews, data studies. At any stage in the course of the review, USEPA may reach preliminary findings that could impair the commercial viability of a product. For example, in connection with USEPA’s review of the DCPA registration, based upon a comparative thyroid assay study (which is comparatively rare and quite complex), based upon limited data points, the USEPA found an adverse effect upon neonate rodents. Consequently, in June 2023, the agency published preliminary findings, noting its concern that based upon current, permitted use patterns, the product could have an adverse effect upon human health and, in particular, pregnant women. At the same time, the agency invited the Company to examine mitigation measures to allay their concerns, which the Company has done. There is no guarantee that mitigation measures or additional data proffered by the Company will be sufficient to overcome USEPA’s conclusions. Further, it is possible that the agency could take more drastic measures to either reduce the use or cancel the registration of the product. Regulatory activities of this nature, whether in connection with DCPA or other products of significance, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.The Company benefits from customer early pay in meeting its working capital needs. As is the case with other companies in this industry, the Company receives cash from certain major customers at year-end in exchange for granting discounts on the Company’s products during the first half of the following year. The Company typically uses this cash to pay down secured debt and for other working capital needs. This flow of cash obviates the need for additional borrowing, which, in turn, preserves borrowing capacity used in part for paying customer programs at the end of the calendar year and, consequently, reduces interest expense. There is no guarantee that the Company’s customers will continue to support the early pay program at current levels. Further a material change in this program could have an adverse effect on the Company’s liquidity and its ability to meet working capital demands. Product liability judgments on glyphosate and cases involving other pesticides by domestic courts present a litigation risk to companies in this industry. Multiple judgments have been rendered by domestic courts in product liability cases against Bayer/Monsanto in connection with injuries allegedly arising from exposure to the herbicide product, glyphosate. The basis was purported carcinogenicity based largely upon the findings of a certain international organization, despite significant scientific evidence to the contrary. While the Company does not sell glyphosate, the theory of these results could put one or more of the Company’s products at risk. There is no guarantee that one or more product liability actions would not be brought against the Company on a similar basis, and it is possible that adverse rulings in any such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.The trend of passing pesticide “ban-bills” in various states could put one or more of the Company’s products at risk. In certain states, including Maryland and New York, state and/or local legislatures have passed legislation banning the use of specific pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos, or pesticide in general, in spite of valid registrations at USEPA and/or the equivalent state agency. While the Company does not sell chlorpyrifos products, there is no guarantee that one or more of its registered products will not be targeted in state or local legislation of this nature. Further, such legislation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.10 Use of the Company’s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups. Use of agrochemical products, including the Company’s products, is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal, state and foreign statutes, including FIFRA, the Food Quality Protection Act, Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and the Clean Water Act, to name a few. These challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the USEPA and/or other federal, state or foreign agencies, the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions, the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the Company’s interests, and/or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by regulatory agencies in the course of registration, re-registration or label expansion. The most prominent of these actions include a line of cases under which environmental groups have sought to suspend, cancel or otherwise restrict the use of pesticides that have been approved by USEPA on the ground that that agency failed to confer with the National Marine Fishery Service and/or the Fish and Wildlife Service under the ESA with respect to biological opinions relating to the use of such products. While industry has been active in defending registrations and proposing administrative and legislative approaches to address serious resource issues at the affected agencies, these cases continue to be brought. It is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed, resulting in a material adverse effect on the Company's financial performance in future reporting periods.The distribution and sale of the Company’s products are subject to governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation. The Company’s products are subject to laws administered by federal, state and foreign governments, including regulations requiring registration, approval and labeling of its products. The labeling requirements restrict the use of, and type of, application for our products. More stringent restrictions could make our products less available, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability and cash flows. Substantially all the Company’s products are subject to the USEPA (and/or similar agencies in the various territories or jurisdictions in which we do business) registration and re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA or similar laws. Such registration requirements are based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions. All states, where any of the Company’s products are used, also require registration before products can be marketed or used in that state. Governmental regulatory authorities have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be fulfilled on the Company’s products. The Company, on its behalf and also in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products. There can be no assurance, however, that the USEPA or similar agencies will not request that certain tests or studies be repeated, or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future. The Company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance.The manufacturing of the Company’s products is subject to governmental regulations. The Company currently owns and operates six manufacturing facilities which are located in Commerce, California; Axis, Alabama; Hannibal, Missouri; Marsing, Idaho; Clackamas, Oregon; and Etchojoa, Mexico (the “Facilities”). The Facilities operate under the laws and regulations imposed by relevant country, state and local authorities. The manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the Company’s products occurs at the Facilities. An inability to renew or maintain a license or permit, or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits, could impede the Company’s manufacture of one or more of its products and/or increase the cost of production; this, in turn, would materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to provide customers with its products in a timely and affordable manner.A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We operate in many different countries and in many states within the United States, and we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A material change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods. 11 Climate Change may adversely affect the Company’s business. Over the course of the past several years, global climate conditions have become increasingly inconsistent, volatile and unpredictable. Many of the regions in which the Company does business have experienced excessive moisture, cold, drought and/or heat of an unprecedented nature at various times of the year. In some cases, these conditions have either reduced or obviated the need for the Company’s products, whether pre-plant, at-plant, post-emergent or at harvest. Further, climate change could disrupt our operations by causing loss of human life, impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing, causing physical damage and partial or complete closure of our manufacturing sites or distribution centers, temporary or long-term disruption in the manufacturing and supply of products and services and disruption in our ability to deliver products and services to customers. In addition, these events and disruptions could increase insurance and other operating costs, including impacting our decisions regarding construction of new facilities to select areas less prone to climate change risks and natural disasters, which could result in indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain or other price modifications to our products and services. The Company’s business may be adversely affected by weather effects and commodity prices. Demand for many of the Company’s products tends to vary with weather conditions and weather-related pressure from pests. Adverse weather conditions, then, may reduce the Company’s revenues and profitability. In light of the possibility of adverse seasonal effects, there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain sales performance at historical levels in any particular region. Similarly, demand for the Company’s products used in row crops tends to vary with the commodity prices of those crops, for instance, corn, soybeans and cotton. These prices may be driven in part by weather, pest pressure, the domestic farm economy and international markets (e.g., yield and pricing from similar crops grown in Brazil). There is no guarantee that the farm economy and row crop commodity prices will maintain sufficient strength and stability to support the Company’s products at or above historical levels. The Company may be subject to environmental liabilities. The Company is fully committed toward minimizing the risk of discharge of materials into the environment and to complying with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment, its neighbors and its workforce. Nevertheless, federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for any violation of the various laws and governmental regulations. In addition, while the Company continually adapts its manufacturing processes to the latest environmental control standards of regulatory authorities, it cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials. In short, the Company may be held liable for significant damages or fines relating to any environmental contamination, injury, or compliance violation which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.Acquisition/Investment RisksNewly acquired businesses or product lines may not generate forecasted results. While the Company conducts due diligence using a combination of internal and third-party resources and applies what it believes to be appropriate criteria for each transaction before making acquisitions, there is no guarantee that a business or product line acquired by the Company will generate results that meet or exceed results that were forecasted by the Company when evaluating the acquisition. There are many factors that could affect the performance of a newly acquired business or product line. While the Company uses assumptions that are based upon due diligence and other market information in valuing a business or product line prior to concluding an acquisition, actual results generated post-closing could vary widely from the Company’s forecast and, as such, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.The Company’s investment in foreign businesses may pose additional risks. With the expansion of its footprint internationally, the Company now carries on business at a material level in some jurisdictions that have a history of political, economic or currency-related instability and customers with a potentially higher risk profile regarding accounts receivable collectability, as compared to the Company’s legacy business. While such instability may not be present at the current time, there is no guarantee that conditions will not change in one or more jurisdictions quickly and without notice, nor is there any guarantee that the Company would be able to recoup its investment in such territories in light of such changes and potential losses due to political factors, economic factors, devaluation of local currencies, or the collectability risk from customers. Adverse changes of this nature could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.12 The Company’s investment in technology may not generate forecasted returns. The Company has had a history of investing in technological innovation, including with respect to precision application technologies (such as SIMPAS and Ultimus), natural oil technology and biologicals, as part of its growth strategy. These investments are based upon the premise that new technology will allow for safer handling or lower overall toxicity profile of the Company’s product portfolio, appeal to regulatory agencies and the market we serve, gain commercial acceptance, and command a return that is sufficiently in excess of the investment. However, there is no guarantee that a new technology will be successfully commercialized, generate a material return or maintain market appeal. Further, many types of development costs must be expensed in the period in which they are incurred. This, in turn, tends to put downward pressure on period profitability. There can be no assurance that these expenses will be recovered through successful long-term commercialization of a new technology.The Company’s growth has been fueled in part by acquisitions. Over the past few decades, the Company’s growth has been driven by acquisitions and licensing of both established and developmental products from third parties. There is no guarantee that acquisition targets or licensing opportunities meeting the Company’s investment criteria will remain available or will be affordable. If such opportunities do not present themselves, then the Company may be unable to duplicate historical growth rates in future years.The Company faces competition from generic competitors that source product from countries having lower cost structures. The Company continues to face competition from competitors around the globe that may enter the market through either offers to pay data compensation, or similar means in foreign jurisdictions, and then subsequently source material from countries having lower cost structures (typically India and China). These competitors typically tend to operate at thinner gross margins and, with low costs of goods, tend to drive pricing and profitability of subject product lines downward. There is no guarantee that the Company will maintain market share and pricing when facing such generic competitors, or that such competitors will not offer generic versions of the Company’s products in the future.The Company’s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the Company’s larger competitors. A significant portion of the Company’s products are sold to national distributors in the U.S., which also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the Company. Typically, revenues from the sales of these competitor product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors’ income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the Company’s product lines. With the recent consolidation among domestic distribution companies, these considerations have become more pronounced. In light of these facts, there is no assurance that such customers will continue to market our products aggressively or successfully, or that the Company will be able to influence such customers to continue to purchase our products instead of those of our competitors.Industry consolidation may threaten the Company’s position in various markets. The global agricultural chemical industry continues to undergo significant consolidation. Many of the Company’s competitors have grown or are expected to grow through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, these competitors will tend to be in position to realize greater economies of scale, offer more diverse portfolios and thereby exert greater influence throughout the distribution channels. Consequently, the Company may find it more difficult to compete in various markets. While such merger activity may generate acquisition opportunities for the Company, there is no guarantee that the Company will benefit from such opportunities. Further, there is a risk that the Company’s future performance may be hindered by the growth of its competitors through consolidation.The Company is dependent on a limited number of customers, which makes it vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers. Our top three customers accounted for 37% of the Company’s sales in 2023, and 39% of the Company’s sales in both 2022 and 2021. The Company’s future prospects may depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers. The Company cannot guarantee that these key customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels. The loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.13 General RisksThe carrying value of certain assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets may be subject to impairment depending upon market trends and other factors. The Company regularly reviews the carrying value of certain assets, including long-lived assets, inventory, fixed assets and intangibles. Depending upon the class of assets in question, the Company takes into account various factors including, among others, sales, trends, market conditions, cash flows, profit margins and the like. Based upon this analysis, where circumstances warrant, the Company may leave such carrying values unchanged or adjust them as appropriate. There is no guarantee that these carrying values can be maintained indefinitely, and it is possible that one or more such assets could be subject to impairment which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.The Company’s computing systems are subject to cyber security risks. In the course of its operations the Company relies on its computing systems, including access to the internet, the use of third-party applications and the storage and transmission of data through such systems. While the Company has implemented security measures to protect these systems, there is no guarantee that a third-party will not penetrate these defenses through hacking, phishing or otherwise and either compromise, corrupt or shut down these systems. Further, in the event of such incursion it is possible that confidential business information and private personal data could be taken and operations, including procurement, customer service, finance, and manufacturing, could be compromised. Such an event could adversely affect both the Company’s ability to operate, its reputation with key stakeholders and its overall financial performance.Reduced financial performance may limit the Company’s ability to borrow under its credit facility. The Company has historically grown net sales and net income through the expansion of current product lines, the acquisition of product lines from third parties and the acquisition of both domestic and international distributors with strong niche market positions. In order to finance such acquisitions, the Company has drawn upon its senior credit facility. However, the Company’s borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility depends, in part, upon its satisfaction of a negative covenant that sets a maximum ratio of borrowed debt to earnings (as measured over the trailing 12-month period). There is no guarantee that the Company will continue to generate earnings necessary to ensure that it has sufficient borrowing capacity to support future acquisitions or that, when necessary, the lender group will amend the senior credit facility to provide for such borrowing capacity. Further, despite the Company’s long-standing relationship with its lenders, in light of the uncertainties in global financial markets, there is no guarantee that the Company’s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the Company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the Company’s working capital needs.To the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities, the Company may experience lower profitability. While the Company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of its manufacturing facilities, our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors, including fluctuating market conditions, product life cycles, weather conditions in our key markets, availability of raw materials, manufacturing equipment performance, retention of the workforce and regulatory constraints, among other things. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maximize the utilization of its manufacturing facilities. Underutilization of such manufacturing resources could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.The Company’s continued success depends, in part, upon a limited number of key employees. Within certain functions, the Company relies heavily on a small number of key employees to manage ongoing operations and to perform strategic planning. In some cases, there are no internal candidates who are qualified to succeed these key personnel in the short term. In the event that the Company were to lose one or more key employees, there is no guarantee that the Company could replace them with people having comparable skills. Further, the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the operation of our business.Domestic and regional inflation trends, increased interest rates and other factors could lead to the erosion of economies and adversely impact the Company. Both the US and many other countries are experiencing inflation, which, in turn, is leading to increased costs in multiple industry segments, including agriculture and related industries. The persistence of inflation has led central bankers to increase interest rates within their regions. There is no guarantee that these measures will arrest the inflationary trend. Further, these factors, taken together with reduced productivity and constraints on the labor supply, could lead to recessionary periods in the regions in which the Company does business. While the Company takes measures within its control to manage the effects of inflation, higher interest rates and other factors, ultimately, they are outside of the Company’s control. Further, the persistence and/or severity of one or more of them could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.14 "
15,AVD,AMERICAN VANGUARD CORP,2023-03-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSSupply Chain/Regulatory/Geopolitical/Tax RisksDisruption in the global supply chain is creating delays, unavailability and adverse conditions for our industry, including significant price increases especially with regard to ocean bound shipments. Since the inception of the coronavirus pandemic, the global supply chain has been under increased stress stemming from container shortages, a lack of domestic truck drivers and a shift in consumer buying habits. While shipping channels normalized in 2022, freight costs rose to peak levels. Further, the lockdown practices arising from China’s zero-COVID policy, followed by a lifting of those practices and widespread infection have resulted in factory capacity constraints and temporary closures in that country. This disruption interrupted the supply of a certain key intermediate ingredient for the Company’s leading corn soil insecticide during the fourth quarter of 2022, which contributed to lower-than-expected net sales and profit margin of the Company on a consolidated basis during that reporting period. While that supplier has resumed full operations, there is no guarantee that continued supply of raw materials and intermediates will not be impacted by further developments relating to the pandemic in that region. Such disruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operations, financial condition or cash flows. The regulatory climate remains challenging to the Company’s interests both domestically and internationally. Various agencies within the U.S. (both federal and state) and foreign governments continue to exercise increased scrutiny in permitting continued uses (or the expansion of such uses) of many chemistries, including several of the Company’s products and, in some cases, have initiated or entertained challenges to these uses. The challenge of the regulatory climate is more pronounced in certain geographical regions (outside the U.S.) where the Company faces resistance to the continued use of certain of its products. For example, the European Union (“EU”) employs a hazard-based analysis when considering whether product registrations can be maintained; under this approach, EU regulatory authorities typically do not weigh benefit against risk in their assessments and routinely cancel products for which a safer alternative is available, notwithstanding the benefit of the cancelled product. There is no guarantee that this regulatory climate will change in the near term or that the Company will be able to maintain or expand the uses of many of its products in the face of such regulatory challenges.10 Several of the Company’s organophosphates are subject to a petition to revoke tolerances under the FFDCA which, if granted, could result in the limitation and/or cancellation of one or more registrations for such products. Presently, several of the Company’s organophosphate products are under registration review before the USEPA and, at the same time, subject to a petition to revoke tolerances under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (""FFDCA""). The Company continues to provide data and other analysis to USEPA in support of its registrations and in response to that agency’s requests for clarification. However, in the recent past, USEPA revoked tolerances for chlorpyrifos (an OP not sold by the Company) finding that food residues from that product could not be deemed with reasonable certainty to cause no harm Consequently, the agency cancelled the registrations for chlorpyrifos. There is no guarantee that USEPA will not make a similar finding with respect to one or more of the Company’s OPs, and that some or all uses of the Company’s OP products could be limited or cancelled. Accordingly, the Company intends to take all action necessary to defend its registrations. Such limitations and/or cancellations could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.USEPA has issued a proposed final decision (""PFD"") to cancel PCNB. In mid-2022, the USEPA issued a “proposed final decision” (a variety of agency action heretofore unknown to registrants) to cancel the fungicide PCNB, which is registered by the company for use on golf courses and potatoes, among other things. The basis for its PFD was the agency’s initial contention that the product is persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic (“PBT”). The Company disagrees with the agency’s contention and believes that its scientific support for those findings is flawed. In reaching a conclusion that a registered product is a PBT, the agency tends to focus far less on product benefit and far more on product risk. Further, by issuing a PFD, USEPA is, in effect, skipping two steps in the registration review process (namely, the preliminary interim decision and interim decision) during which the Company would otherwise have more time to answer the agency’s concerns and otherwise provide data necessary to support continued registration. In effect, then, the Company must meet a truncated schedule for defending this product, all of which is posted on a public docket, and is doing so under a more stringent standard of review (namely, that of a deemed PBT). Since making its initial determination, the agency has suggested that PCNB may merely have some characteristics of a PBT. There is no guarantee that the Company will succeed in persuading USEPA not to cancel the PCNB registration. AMVAC is the sole registrant of PCNB which it manufactures at its own facility. Loss of this product could have a material adverse negative effect on our operating results. USEPA has issued a notice of intention to suspend DCPA, the technical ingredient of an important herbicide registered by the company for use on high-value vegetable crops. In April 2022, USEPA issued a notice of intention to suspend (""NOITS"") the registration for DCPA based upon the company’s alleged failure to take appropriate steps in responding to an extensive data call in for nearly 90 data studies. The NOITS came as a surprise to AMVAC, as it had been working in good faith to provide dozens of studies over several years, some of which were so complex that it required a review process extending to five years just to define the study protocols. The NOITS is currently pending before an administrative law judge (""ALJ""), who conducted a hearing on the matter in January 2023 and is likely to issue an order within 90-120 days. There is no guarantee that the ALJ will rule in AMVAC’s favor and deny the requested suspension. If AMVAC does not succeed at the NOITS hearing, there is no guarantee that USEPA will not seek to suspend the registration of most any product for which a data call-in is pending, including one or more of AMVAC’s other products. Further, a suspension of DCPA and/or other products could have a material, adverse effect upon the Company’s business operations and financial performance. Product liability judgments on glyphosate and cases involving other pesticides by domestic courts present a litigation risk to companies in this industry. Multiple judgments have been rendered by domestic courts in product liability cases against Bayer/Monsanto in connection with injuries allegedly arising from exposure to the herbicide product, glyphosate. The basis was purported carcinogenicity based largely upon the findings of a certain international organization, despite significant scientific evidence to the contrary. While the Company does not sell glyphosate, the theory of these results could put one or more of the Company’s products at risk. There is no guarantee that one or more product liability actions would not be brought against the Company on a similar basis, and it is possible that adverse rulings in any such actions could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.The trend of passing pesticide “ban-bills” in various states could put one or more of the Company’s products at risk—In certain states, including Maryland and New York, state and/or local legislatures have passed legislation banning the use of specific pesticides, such as chlorpyrifos, or pesticide in general, in spite of valid registrations at USEPA and/or the equivalent state agency. While the Company does not sell chlorpyrifos products, there is no guarantee that one or more of its registered products would not be targeted in state or local legislation of this nature. Further, such legislation could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial performance in future reporting periods.11 Use of the Company’s products is subject to continuing challenges from activist groups. Use of agrochemical products, including the Company’s products, is regularly challenged by activist groups in many jurisdictions under a multitude of federal, state and foreign statutes, including FIFRA, the Food Quality Protection Act, Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and the Clean Water Act, to name a few. These challenges typically take the form of lawsuits or administrative proceedings against the USEPA and/or other federal, state or foreign agencies, the filing of amicus briefs in pending actions, the introduction of legislation that is inimical to the Company’s interests, and/or adverse comments made in response to public comment invited by regulatory agencies in the course of registration, re-registration or label expansion. The most prominent of these actions include a line of cases under which environmental groups have sought to suspend, cancel or otherwise restrict the use of pesticides that have been approved by USEPA on the ground that that agency failed to confer with the National Marine Fishery Service and/or the Fish and Wildlife Service under the ESA with respect to biological opinions relating to the use of such products. While industry has been active in defending registrations and proposing administrative and legislative approaches to address serious resource issues at the affected agencies, these cases continue to be brought. It is possible that one or more of these challenges could succeed, resulting in a material adverse effect upon one or more of the Company’s products and consolidated financial statements.The distribution and sale of the Company’s products are subject to governmental approvals and thereafter ongoing governmental regulation. The Company’s products are subject to laws administered by federal, state and foreign governments, including regulations requiring registration, approval and labeling of its products. The labeling requirements restrict the use of, and type of, application for our products. More stringent restrictions could make our products less available, which would adversely affect our revenues and profitability and cash flows. Substantially all the Company’s products are subject to the USEPA (and/or similar agencies in the various territories or jurisdictions in which we do business) registration and re-registration requirements and are registered in accordance with FIFRA or similar laws. Such registration requirements are based, among other things, on data demonstrating that the product will not cause unreasonable adverse effects on human health or the environment when used according to approved label directions. All states, where any of the Company’s products are used, also require registration before products, such as the Company sells, can be marketed or used in that state. Governmental regulatory authorities have required, and may require in the future, that certain scientific data requirements be fulfilled on the Company’s products. The Company, on its behalf and also in joint efforts with other registrants, has furnished, and is currently furnishing certain required data relative to its products. There can be no assurance, however, that the USEPA or similar agencies will not request that certain tests or studies be repeated, or that more stringent legislation or requirements will not be imposed in the future. The Company can provide no assurance that any testing approvals or registrations will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, or that its resources will be adequate to meet the costs of regulatory compliance.The manufacturing of the Company’s products is subject to governmental regulations. The Company currently owns and operates six manufacturing facilities which are located in Los Angeles, California; Axis, Alabama; Hannibal, Missouri; Marsing, Idaho; Clackamas, Oregon; and Etchojoa, Mexico (the “Facilities”). The Facilities operate under the laws and regulations imposed by relevant country, state and local authorities. The manufacturing of key ingredients for certain of the Company’s products occurs at the Facilities. An inability to renew or maintain a license or permit, or a significant increase in the fees for such licenses or permits, could impede the Company’s manufacture of one or more of its products and/or increase the cost of production; this, in turn, would materially and adversely affect the Company’s ability to provide customers with its products in a timely and affordable manner.A change in tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. We operate in many different countries and in many states within the United States, and we are subject to changes in applicable tax laws, treaties or regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. A material change in these tax laws, treaties or regulations, or their interpretation or application, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (the ""IRA"") was signed into law. The IRA contains several revisions to the Internal Revenue Code, including a 15% corporate minimum income tax for corporations with average annual adjusted financial statement income over a three-tax-year period in excess of $1 billion and is effective for the tax years beginning after December 31, 2022, a 1% excise tax on stock repurchases made by publicly traded U.S. corporations after December 31, 2022, and business tax credits and incentives for the development of clean energy projects and the production of clean energy. At this time, we do not expect the IRA will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. However, any future stock repurchase of our common stock will be subject to the new excise tax law.12 Pandemic/Climate/Geopolitical RisksThe COVID-19 pandemic is creating risk, uncertainties and adverse conditions in many industries both here and abroad. The Company is closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of its business, including how the pandemic is impacting its customers, business partners, and employees. While the Company did not incur significant disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 the Company is unable to predict the impact that the pandemic will have on its future financial condition, results of operations and cash flows due to numerous uncertainties. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’s operations and those of its customers will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, among others. There is no guarantee that the Company will be able to operate without material disruption for the duration of the pandemic or that its financial conditions and results of operations and cash flows will not be materially adversely affected by the pandemic in future periods.Climate Change may adversely affect the Company’s business. Over the course of the past several years, global climate conditions have become increasingly inconsistent, volatile and unpredictable. Many of the regions in which the Company does business have experienced excessive moisture, cold, drought and/or heat of an unprecedented nature at various times of the year. In some cases, these conditions have either reduced or obviated the need for the Company’s products, whether pre-plant, at-plant, post-emergent or at harvest. Further, the random nature of climactic change has made it increasingly difficult to forecast market demand and, consequently, financial performance, from year-to-year. There is no guarantee that climate change will abate in the near future, and it is possible that such change will continue to hinder the Company’s ability to forecast its sales performance with accuracy and otherwise adversely affect the Company’s financial performance. The Company’s business may be adversely affected by weather effects and commodity prices. Demand for many of the Company’s products tends to vary with weather conditions and weather-related pressure from pests. Adverse weather conditions, then, may reduce the Company’s revenues and profitability. In light of the possibility of adverse seasonal effects, there can be no assurance that the Company will maintain sales performance at historical levels in any particular region. Similarly, demand for the Company’s products used in row crops tends to vary with the commodity prices of those crops, for instance, corn, soybeans and cotton. These prices may be driven in part by weather, pest pressure, the domestic farm economy and international markets (e.g., yield and pricing from similar crops grown in Brazil). There is no guarantee that the farm economy and row crop commodity prices will maintain sufficient strength and stability to support the Company’s products at or above historical levels. The Russian invasion of Ukraine may expand into a broader international conflict that could adversely affect multiple channels of commerce and markets. While business operations relating to Ukraine constitute an immaterial part of the Company’s overall business, there is no guarantee that the current conflict will not draw military intervention from other countries or retaliation from Russia, which, in turn, could lead to a much larger conflict. If such escalation should occur, supply chain, trade routes and markets currently served by the Company could be adversely affected, which, in turn, could materially, adversely affect the Company’s business operations and financial performance. The Company may be subject to environmental liabilities. The Company is fully committed toward minimizing the risk of discharge of materials into the environment and to complying with governmental regulations relating to protection of the environment, its neighbors and its workforce. Nevertheless, federal and state authorities may seek fines and penalties for any violation of the various laws and governmental regulations. In addition, while the Company continually adapts its manufacturing processes to the latest environmental control standards of regulatory authorities, it cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous or regulated materials. In short, the Company may be held liable for significant damages or fines relating to any environmental contamination, injury, or compliance violation which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition, statements of operations and cash flows.13 Acquisition/Investment RisksNewly acquired businesses or product lines may not generate forecasted results. While the Company conducts due diligence using a combination of internal and third-party resources and applies what it believes to be appropriate criteria for each transaction before making acquisitions, there is no guarantee that a business or product line acquired by the Company will generate results that meet or exceed results that were forecasted by the Company when evaluating the acquisition. There are many factors that could affect the performance of a newly acquired business or product line. While the Company uses assumptions that are based upon due diligence and other market information in valuing a business or product line prior to concluding an acquisition, actual results generated post-closing could vary widely from the Company’s forecast and, as such, could have a material effect upon the Company’s overall financial performance.The Company’s investment in foreign businesses may pose additional risks. With the expansion of its footprint internationally, the Company now carries on business at a material level in some jurisdictions that have a history of political, economic or currency-related instability and customers with a potentially higher risk profile regarding accounts receivable collectability, as compared to the Company’s legacy business. While such instability may not be present at the current time, there is no guarantee that conditions will not change in one or more jurisdictions quickly and without notice, nor is there any guarantee that the Company would be able to recoup its investment in such territories in light of such changes and potential losses due to political factors, economic factors, devaluation of local currencies, or the collectability risk from customers. Adverse changes of this nature could have a material effect upon the Company’s overall financial performance.The Company’s investment in technology may not generate forecasted returns. The Company has had a history of investing in technological innovation, including with respect to precision application technologies (such as SIMPAS and Ultimus), natural oil technology and biologicals, as one of its core strategies. These investments are based upon the premise that new technology will allow for safer handling or lower overall toxicity profile of the Company’s product portfolio, appeal to regulatory agencies and the market we serve, gain commercial acceptance, and command a return that is sufficiently in excess of the investment. However, there is no guarantee that a new technology will be successfully commercialized, generate a material return or maintain market appeal. Further, many types of development costs must be expensed in the period in which they are incurred. This, in turn, tends to put downward pressure on period profitability. There can be no assurance that these expenses will be recovered through successful long-term commercialization of a new technology.The Company’s growth has been fueled in part by acquisitions. Over the past few decades, the Company’s growth has been driven by acquisitions and licensing of both established and developmental products from third parties. There is no guarantee that acquisition targets or licensing opportunities meeting the Company’s investment criteria will remain available or will be affordable. If such opportunities do not present themselves, then the Company may be unable to duplicate historical growth rates in future years.The Company is dependent upon sole source suppliers for certain of its raw materials and active ingredients. There are a limited number of suppliers of certain important raw materials used by the Company in a number of its products. Certain of these raw materials are available solely from single sources either domestically or overseas. In connection with supply chain disruptions in 2021, phosphorus and related compounds were increasingly difficult to source for our entire industry; ensuring a continuous supply required extraordinary efforts both with respect to sourcing and production planning. In the last quarter of 2022, there was a temporary supply chain shortage of one key raw material of the Company’s largest corn soil insecticide, Aztec. That said, there is no guarantee that any of our suppliers will be willing or able to supply these products to the Company reliably, continuously and at the levels anticipated by the Company or required by the market. If these sources prove to be unreliable and the Company is not able to supplant or otherwise second source these products, it is possible that the Company will not achieve its projected sales which, in turn, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company faces competition from generic competitors that source product from countries having lower cost structures. The Company continues to face competition from competitors around the globe that may enter the market through either offers to pay data compensation, or similar means in foreign jurisdictions, and then subsequently source material from countries having lower cost structures (typically India and China). These competitors typically tend to operate at thinner gross margins and, with low costs of goods, tend to drive pricing and profitability of subject product lines downward. There is no guarantee that the Company will maintain market share and pricing when facing such generic competitors, or that such competitors will not offer generic versions of the Company’s products in the future.14 The Company’s key customers typically carry competing product lines and may be influenced by the Company’s larger competitors. A significant portion of the Company’s products are sold to national distributors in the U.S., which also carry product lines of competitors that are much larger than the Company. Typically, revenues from the sales of these competitor product lines and related program incentives constitute a greater part of our distributors’ income than do revenues from sales and program incentives arising from the Company’s product lines. With the recent consolidation among domestic distribution companies, these considerations have become more pronounced. In light of these facts, there is no assurance that such customers will continue to market our products aggressively or successfully, or that the Company will be able to influence such customers to continue to purchase our products instead of those of our competitors.Industry consolidation may threaten the Company’s position in various markets. The global agricultural chemical industry continues to undergo significant consolidation. Many of the Company’s competitors have grown or are expected to grow through mergers and acquisitions. As a result, these competitors will tend to be in position to realize greater economies of scale, offer more diverse portfolios and thereby exert greater influence throughout the distribution channels. Consequently, the Company may find it more difficult to compete in various markets. While such merger activity may generate acquisition opportunities for the Company, there is no guarantee that the Company will benefit from such opportunities. Further, there is a risk that the Company’s future performance may be hindered by the growth of its competitors through consolidation.The Company is dependent on a limited number of customers, which makes it vulnerable to the continued relationship with and financial health of those customers. Our top three customers accounted for 39% of the Company’s sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company’s future prospects may depend on the continued business of such customers and on our continued status as a qualified supplier to such customers. The Company cannot guarantee that these key customers will continue to buy products from us at current levels. The loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.General RisksThe carrying value of certain assets on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets may be subject to impairment depending upon market trends and other factors—The Company regularly reviews the carrying value of certain assets, including long-lived assets, inventory, fixed assets and intangibles. Depending upon the class of assets in question, the Company takes into account various factors including, among others, sales, trends, market conditions, cash flows, profit margins and the like. Based upon this analysis, where circumstances warrant, the Company may leave such carrying values unchanged or adjust them as appropriate. There is no guarantee that these carrying values can be maintained indefinitely, and it is possible that one or more such assets could be subject to impairment which, in turn, could have an adverse impact upon the Company’s consolidated financial statements.The Company’s computing systems are subject to cyber security risks. In the course of its operations the Company relies on its computing systems, including access to the internet, the use of third-party applications and the storage and transmission of data through such systems. While the Company has implemented security measures to protect these systems, there is no guarantee that a third-party will not penetrate these defenses through hacking, phishing or otherwise and either compromise, corrupt or shut down these systems. Further, in the event of such incursion it is possible that confidential business information and private personal data could be taken. Such an event could adversely affect both the Company’s ability to operate, its reputation with key stakeholders and its overall financial performance.15 Reduced financial performance may limit the Company’s ability to borrow under its credit facility. The Company has historically grown net sales and net income through the expansion of current product lines, the acquisition of product lines from third parties and the acquisition of both domestic and international distributors with strong niche market positions. In order to finance such acquisitions, the Company has drawn upon its senior credit facility. However, the Company’s borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility depends, in part, upon its satisfaction of a negative covenant that sets a maximum ratio of borrowed debt to earnings (as measured over the trailing 12-month period). There is no guarantee that the Company will continue to generate earnings necessary to ensure that it has sufficient borrowing capacity to support future acquisitions or that, when necessary, the lender group will amend the senior credit facility to provide for such borrowing capacity. Further, despite the Company’s long-standing relationship with its lenders, in light of the uncertainties in global financial markets, there is no guarantee that the Company’s lenders will be either willing or able to continue lending to the Company at such rates and in such amounts as may be necessary to meet the Company’s working capital needs.The Company is subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdiction. The Company is a U.S. based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. In 2017, the U.S. enacted significant tax reform, and in the long-term certain provisions of the new law may adversely affect us. In addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the EU, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. If U.S. or other foreign tax authorities change applicable tax laws, our overall taxes could increase, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows may be adversely impacted. To the extent that capacity utilization is not fully realized at its manufacturing facilities, the Company may experience lower profitability. While the Company endeavors continuously to maximize utilization of its manufacturing facilities, our success in these endeavors is dependent upon many factors, including fluctuating market conditions, product life cycles, weather conditions in our key markets, availability of raw materials, manufacturing equipment performance, retention of the workforce and regulatory constraints, among other things. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to maximize the utilization of its manufacturing facilities. Underutilization of such manufacturing resources could have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial performance. The Company’s continued success depends, in part, upon a limited number of key employees. Within certain functions, the Company relies heavily on a small number of key employees to manage ongoing operations and to perform strategic planning. In some cases, there are no internal candidates who are qualified to succeed these key personnel in the short term. In the event that the Company were to lose one or more key employees, there is no guarantee that Company could replace them with people having comparable skills. Further, the loss of key personnel could adversely affect the operation of our business.Domestic and regional inflation trends, increased interest rates and other factors could lead to the erosion of economies and adversely impact the Company. Both the US and many other countries are experiencing inflation, which, in turn, is leading to increased costs in multiple industry segments, including agriculture and related industries. The persistence of inflation has led central bankers to increase interest rates within their regions. There is no guarantee that these measures will arrest the inflationary trend. Further, these factors, taken together with reduced productivity and constraints on the labor supply could lead to recessionary periods in the regions in which the Company does business. While the Company takes measures within its control to manage the effects of inflation, higher interest rates and other factors, ultimately, they are outside of the Company’s control. Further, the persistence and/or severity of one or more of them could adversely affect the financial performance and/or operations of the Company.16 "
