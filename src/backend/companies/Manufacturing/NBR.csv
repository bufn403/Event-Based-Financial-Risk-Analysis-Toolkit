13,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2024-02-12,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS​In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.​Risk Factors
 Summary​The following is a summary of the principal risks included in this annual report that we believe could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.​Business and Operational Risks​●Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.●Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.●We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.●We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.●The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.●Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated on short notice and/or without an early termination payment.●The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.●The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.●We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.●Our contracts with state-owned energy companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.●Control of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may affect the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.●Our operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.●Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.●Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.●Decisions by internet service, cloud hosting service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors.●Failure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.12Table of Contents●Our aspirations, goals and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to risks.●We are subject to a number of uncertainties during the timeframe when Nabors Energy Transition Corporation II (NETC II) pursues a business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.​Financial Risks​●We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.●Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.●Volatility in prices of goods and services and interest rates could expose us to risks in managing our operating and capital costs.●Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.●A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.​Technology Risks​●New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.●Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenues and any competitive advantage we hold.●Technology disputes could negatively affect our operations or increase our costs.●Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Legal and Regulatory Risks​●Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, international laws and regulations, and compliance obligations and risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Violations of these laws could have a negative effect on our business.●Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations regarding environmental matters or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.●The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could have a negative effect on our business.●We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security.●Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.●Our business may be affected by changes in applicable sanctions or export controls laws and regulations, including those targeting Russia.●We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.●The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.​Share Capital and Corporate Structure Risks​●Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.●Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.●Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, provisions in our organizational documents and in our outstanding debt and Saudi 13Table of Contentsjoint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.●As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​General Risks​●Investor sentiment and public perception related to the fossil fuels industry and to ESG initiatives could affect the demand for our services, increase our costs of capital, our reporting requirements and our operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.●Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse effects could be material and difficult to predict.●Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.●The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.​For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, see below.​Business and Operational Risks​Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.​Our operations, demand for our services, and the rates we are able to charge for such services depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile for several years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Declines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand, in addition to significant shocks to regional and global economies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and regional and global conflicts, especially in significant oil-producing regions around the world. Worldwide military, political, public health, and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and OPEC+, uncertainty in capital and commodities markets, and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to access capital, and the extent to which they are willing or able to deploy capital, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere) related to the development/production and use of oil and natural gas, levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general and global economic conditions, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, decisions by oil and gas producers to continue producing oil and gas despite excess supply, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, as well as governmental programs that incentivize the use of alternative energy, public perception of fossil fuel use and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, and thereby affect the price of oil and natural gas.​Lower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely affect our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.​Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.​Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or suppliers will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse effect on the liquidity and operations of our 14Table of Contentscustomers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material effect on our utilization, dayrates, results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers being unable to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity in deployable assets or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the worldwide economy, under capacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate in the future due to one or more factors.​We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.​The oilfield services industry is very competitive with a significant amount of excess capacity. The competitive nature of the business is exacerbated in low oil price environments such as the one we have generally experienced over the last decade. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, an important factor in determining job awards is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or dayrates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.​In addition to our performance, our ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers’ future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing dayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.​Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling industry, including environmental pollution, blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage, reputational harm and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including pollution of coastal waters, damage to wildlife and natural habitats, capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding, and unsound ocean bottom conditions. ​Accidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not sufficiently insured or indemnified, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover certain risks, including war and political risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the effect of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity.  In addition, our safety record is a competitive advantage for us and if one or more incidents were to occur it could significantly affect this advantage.15Table of ContentsOur drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.​Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract. In certain circumstances, including but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate, or any, compensation. Many of these contracts could be terminated or suspended on short notice further exacerbating the effects on our results.  The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, including government-controlled entities, seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. Downturns in the oil price environment may result in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be affected by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​In 2023, 2022 and 2021, we received approximately 37%, 36% and 44%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 26%, 26% and 31% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. Replacing significant customers is difficult, and it is unlikely we would be able to replace such a loss in revenue from a single or a few larger customers, especially Saudi Aramco.  The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to meet our obligations. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments to us or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market and may cause our counterparties to seek modifications to our contracts with them. Furthermore, potential consolidation among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may reduce the number of available customers.​The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.​We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including operations in the Middle East, South America, the Far East, North Africa, central and southern Asia and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, nationalization, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation, particularly in respect of contracts with state-owned oil companies. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain.​16Table of ContentsThe initiation of conflicts in certain regions or by certain agitators, including, but not limited to, the invasion of Ukraine by Russia or the conflicts in the Middle East and around the Red Sea, can have an adverse effect on us should they become more intense and/or widespread.  In addition, conflicts have led to and could lead to the imposition of sanctions that could limit our ability to operate in certain regions.  See, for example, “—Our business may be affected by changes in applicable sanctions or export controls laws and regulations, including those targeting Russia.”​The future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.​Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, labor shortages or other labor-related difficulties, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenues to us, as well as an increase in operating costs.​Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively affected by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, issues with the global supply chain whether caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine/Russia conflict or other reasons could make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet our requirements in a timely manner, if at all, which could ultimately result in an adverse effect on our operations.​Our contracts with state-owned energy companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.​We currently own and operate rigs and rig-related equipment under contracts with state-owned energy companies (“NOCs”). In the future, we may expand our international solutions operations and enter into additional, significant contracts with NOCs. The terms of these contracts may contain non-negotiable provisions and may expose us to greater commercial, political, operational and other risks than we assume in other contracts. These contracts may expose us to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, or under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment. We can provide no assurance that increased risk exposure will not have an adverse effect on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted, or the amount of technology deployed, to NOCs with commensurate additional contractual risks. Risks that accompany contracts with NOCs could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ​Control of oil and natural gas reserves by NOCs may affect the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.​Much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by NOCs, which may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely affect our operations in those countries. In addition, while we do not control the actions of our joint venture partners, their actions could have an effect on our investment in the joint ventures and more generally our overall reputation.  In addition, our ability to work with NOCs is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.​17Table of ContentsOur operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.​Our operating expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of our drilling and related equipment, many of which are not affected by changes in dayrates and some of which are not affected by utilization. During periods of reduced revenues and/or activity, certain of our fixed costs (such as depreciation) may not decline and often we may incur additional costs. During times of reduced utilization, reductions in costs may not be immediate as we may not be able to fully reduce the cost of our support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenues due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in drilling services and solutions expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.​We conduct some operations through joint ventures, from which we derived 24% of our operating revenue during 2023. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, the joint venture operating in a manner that is contrary to our preference or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any non-performance, default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. Certain of these actions could have adverse consequences for us, legal or regulators issues in the region and/or reputational harm, including our attractiveness as a partner in other regions.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.​Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.​We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. The anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees, or the disposition of certain assets or operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Decisions by internet service, cloud host service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors. ​We utilize the internet to provide services and to promote our business and services to current and potential customers and to provide information and updates to our investors. Internet service providers, cloud hosting services, social media companies and website providers that currently allow us to utilize their platforms to communicate with customers and the public may decide that our business or the industry in which we operate negatively affects their business or may make business decisions or changes to their policies that negatively affect us. Such actions could include placing restrictions on our use of their platforms or banning us from utilizing their services altogether. Our inability to use these platforms may have a negative effect on the way we are perceived in the industry or in the media and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Failure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price. ​Our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition, which will require adapting our business to potentially changing government requirements and customer and investor preferences, as well as engaging with our customers to develop solutions to decarbonize oil and gas operations. If the energy transition occurs faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted.18Table of Contents​Our aspirations, goals and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to risks.​We have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, or other objectives related to sustainability matters. Statements related to these goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Some factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the extent to which our customers’ decisions directly impact, relate to, or influence the use of our equipment that creates the emissions we report, (ii) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (iii) evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures, and (iv) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on sustainability matters, including climate-related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls for reporting sustainability matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting such metrics and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. Our business may also face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.​We will be subject to a number of uncertainties during the timeframe when Nabors Energy Transition Corporation II (“NETC II”) pursues a business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.​If NETC II is unable to consummate a suitable business transaction during the prescribed time period set forth in the terms of the initial public offering, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our shareholders. In addition, in the event that NETC II is able to find a suitable business combination, or if the business combination is unsuccessful, there is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated value from such transaction.​Financial Risks​We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.​In 2021, we recognized impairment charges of $60.5 million related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then-carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.​The 2022 Credit Agreement (as defined) is secured with a first lien security interest on all land drilling rigs and related equipment, spare parts and inventory in the contiguous United States. As of December 31, 2023, we had no borrowings under this facility. Under the facility, we are required to maintain an “interest coverage ratio” of no less than 2.50:1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2023, with such ratio periodically increasing in increments of 0.125:1.00 to a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. We are also required to maintain a “minimum guarantor value” of no less than 90% at all times. The interest coverage 19Table of Contentsratio is defined to mean the ratio of (i) EBITDA for the latest four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered to (ii) the interest expense for the latest four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered. The minimum guarantor value is defined to mean the percentage of book value of, minus depreciation and amortization on, property, plant and equipment owned by Nabors and its subsidiaries, that is directly or indirectly owned by the guarantors of the 2022 Credit Agreement (other than Nabors) and their wholly owned subsidiaries. The interest coverage ratio and the minimum guarantor value requirement are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ​As of December 31, 2023, our consolidated total outstanding indebtedness was $3.1 billion. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries’ operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under the 2022 Credit Agreement and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. Our amount of indebtedness may make it more difficult to borrow funds in the future.  In addition, if we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, any of which could negatively affect our stock price or financial condition.​Volatility in prices of goods and services and interest rates could expose us to risks in managing our operating and capital costs.In 2023, inflationary pressures, supply chain constraints and generally improved economic conditions increased our costs for commodities, labor, energy and other components necessary to operate our business. Throughout 2022 and 2023, in an effort to combat inflation, central banks throughout the world have raised, and may further raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation.  We expect these inflationary pressures to continue to impact our margins and more generally, our business in 2024. As a result, the interest rates on our borrowings we are charged may be significantly higher than our interest rates in prior years, which increases our cost to operate our business.  In addition, the 2022 Credit Agreement bears interest at a floating rate and, to the extent we have borrowing outstanding under the facility, the borrowing will bear interest at increased rates compared to our historical rates.  Furthermore, the increased interest rates could affect our clients’ businesses and borrowing costs, which in turn could impact their ability to make payments to us, with the global nature of our operations heightening our exposure to such risks.  For example, we currently have operations in Argentina.  Argentina’s economy is currently considered highly inflationary under U.S. GAAP, which is defined as cumulative inflation rates exceeding 100% in the most recent three-year period.  Our dayrate in Argentina is denominated in U.S. Dollars, but we are paid in Argentine Pesos. Argentina has a history of implementing currency controls, which may limit our ability to access U.S. Dollars in Argentina and repatriate cash from our operations there.Our attempts to offset these increasing costs, such as increases in our dayrates and operational improvements, may not be successful. To the extent that our offsetting measures are not sufficient to offset these higher costs, our results of operations may be adversely affected.​Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.​From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited or adversely affected by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, interest rates and the health or market perceptions of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and/or the oil and gas industry, among others, are outside of our control. There have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as pressuring lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, which, if successful, could limit our ability to access capital markets. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​20Table of ContentsA downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.​Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies. Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow. Any adverse developments in our business and operations could lead to a ratings downgrade to our senior unsecured debt that currently has a non-investment grade rating. Factors that may affect our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and other factors, are also considered by the rating agencies. Any fluctuation in our credit rating, could affect our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources in the future, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Technology Risks​New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.​The market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs and related equipment. Accordingly, we may have to allocate a higher proportion of our capital expenditures to improve the technological aspects of our existing rigs and other equipment, purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs and other equipment to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and develop new and improved technology and data analytics. ​Although a component of our strategy is to develop and use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements on existing technology by competitors could make our equipment less competitive. There can be no assurance that we will:​●have sufficient capital resources to improve existing rigs or build new, technologically advanced drilling rigs;​●avoid cost overruns inherent in large fabrication projects resulting from numerous factors such as shortages or unscheduled delays in delivery of equipment or materials, inadequate levels of skilled labor, unanticipated increases in costs of equipment, materials and labor, design and engineering problems, and financial or other difficulties;​●successfully deploy idle, stacked, new or upgraded drilling rigs;​●effectively manage the size or growth of our organization and drilling fleet;​●develop competitive technologies or choose the right technologies to develop;​●maintain crews necessary to operate existing or additional drilling rigs; or​●successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of improving existing drilling rigs or building new drilling rigs with updated technology.​In the event that we are successful in developing new technologies for use in our business, there is no guarantee of future demand for those technologies. Customers may be financially incapable or otherwise reluctant or unwilling to adopt our new technologies or may choose competing technologies. We may also have difficulty negotiating satisfactory terms for our technology services or may be unable to secure prices sufficient to obtain expected returns on our investment in the research and development of new technologies.​21Table of ContentsFurthermore, we expect our competitors to continue to improve their own technology systems.  Such improvements could potentially allow our competitors to improve their drilling efficiency and service quality.  Our ability to continue to innovate our own technology infrastructure and appropriately anticipate and address our customers’ needs will affect our ability to compete.​Development of new technology is critical to maintaining our competitiveness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop technology that our customers demand. If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances and trends (including trends in favor of emissions-reducing technologies) or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner suitable to their needs, demand for our services could decline and we could lose market share. Furthermore, if our equipment or proprietary technologies become obsolete, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, or one or more technologies that we may implement in the future may not work as we expect and our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected as a result. If competing technologies are viewed as superior to ours it could affect our competitiveness.  Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could reduce our competitiveness and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenues and any competitive advantage we hold.​There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Technology disputes could negatively affect our operations or increase our costs.​Our services and products use proprietary technology and equipment, which can involve potential infringement of a third party’s rights, or a third party’s infringement of our rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs and related services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors. However, in the event that we or one of our customers or supplying vendors becomes involved in a dispute over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment or technology owned or used by us, services performed by us or products provided by us, we may lose access to important equipment or technology or our ability to provide services or products, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or technology or be forced to invest or develop replacement technologies to enhance our equipment, technology, services or products. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or technology or provision of services or products. In addition, we may lose a competitive advantage in the event we are unsuccessful in enforcing our rights against third parties. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Technology disputes involving us or our customers or supplying vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.​Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Since our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies that increase the effectiveness (economic or otherwise), use or availability of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​22Table of ContentsLegal and Regulatory Risks ​Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to international laws and regulations, and compliance obligations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws.​Our international business (including our participation in joint ventures, requirements for local content, and our global supply chain) is subject to numerous political and economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally.  Our international business is generally subject to both U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to export/import controls, sanctions, technology transfers, government contracts and procurement, data privacy and protection, investment, exchange rates and controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the Bermuda Bribery Act (2016) and other anti-corruption laws, anti-boycott provisions, securities laws, labor and employment, works councils and other labor groups, anti-human trafficking, taxes, environment, immunity, security restrictions and intellectual property. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs designed to promote and achieve compliance, we cannot ensure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from risks associated with unlawful acts carried out by our employees or agents. ​Failure by us, our employees, affiliates, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges. Any such penalty could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.​Our international operations also subject us to other risks, including potential asset seizure, terrorist acts, piracy, kidnapping, nationalization of assets, currency restrictions, import or export quotas, tariffs and other forms of public and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control. Economic sanctions or an oil embargo, for example, could have significant impact on activity in the oil and natural gas industry and, correspondingly, us should we operate in an area subject to any sanctions or embargo, or in the surrounding region to the extent any sanctions or embargo disrupts its operations.​Changes to, or noncompliance with laws and regulations regarding environmental matters or exposure to environmental liabilities, could adversely affect our results of operations. ​Drilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health, such as those regulating the spill, release, transport, storage, use, treatment, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and solid wastes and materials. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not able to allocate all risks of environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. ​In addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks. ​Changes in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively affect the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and 23Table of Contentsdemand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations.​The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a negative effect on our business.​There has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (“GHG”), including carbon dioxide and methane, emissions and climate change issues. Future regulation could require industries to meet stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. In addition, the current administration has taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.​The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has published findings that GHG emissions present an endangerment to public health and the environment. The EPA has also issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. In November 2021, the EPA proposed new rules aimed at sharply reducing methane and other emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and gas industry. The Bureau of Land Management also issued a rule in November 2016 requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands.​The United States is a member of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (“COP 21”) in Paris, that set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Paris Agreement requires set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Stronger GHG emission targets were set at the Conference of Parties in Glasgow (“COP 26”) in November 2021 and were reaffirmed at the Conference of Parties in Dubai (“COP 28”) in December 2023.​It is not possible to predict the timing and effect of climate change or whether additional GHG regulations will be adopted. However, more aggressive efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely, and any such future regulations could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or affect the demand for our customers’ products and, accordingly, our services. ​In addition, there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Further, members of the investment community have increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, and an increasing number of our customers consider sustainability factors in awarding work. These developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards lower carbon energy sources such as wind, solar and other renewables. If these efforts are successful, our ability and the ability of our customers to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively affected.​Further, the federal government and certain state governments have enacted, and are expected to continue to enact, laws and regulations that mandate or provide economic incentives for the development of technologies and sources of energy other than oil and gas, such as wind and solar. Such legislation incentivizes the development, use and investment in these technologies and alternative energy sources and could accelerate the shift away from traditional oil and gas. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) of 2022 contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies. Also, in 2022, California mandated that all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the state be electric vehicles or other emissions-free models by 2035. If these future laws and regulations result in customers reducing their production of oil and gas, they could ultimately have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.​Beyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect our facilities and operations and those of our customers. ​24Table of ContentsWe are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security.​Governments around the world have implemented, and continue to implement, laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security, including with respect to the protection and processing of personal data. These laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and we are obligated to comply in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and potential criminal sanctions. Including, for example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”).  Entities in violation of the EU GDPR can face litigation regarding the processing of personal data brought by data subjects or consumer protection organizations, which can lead to corrective actions including fines and prohibitions on data processing.  Similar statutes have been passed in a variety of states in the United States.​Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.​We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See “Item 3—Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings.​Our business may be affected by changes in applicable sanctions or export controls laws and regulations, including those targeting Russia.​Our international operations expose us to compliance obligations and risks under applicable economic sanctions, export controls and trade embargoes, such as those imposed, administered and enforced by the United States and the United Kingdom and other relevant sanctions authorities (collectively, “Sanctions”). In response to ongoing military hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other jurisdictions imposed new and additional economic sanctions, export controls and other trade restrictions (collectively, “Sanctions Measures”) targeting Russia, Belarus and certain regions of Ukraine, including Sanctions Measures that impose: (i) restrictions on engaging in specified activities or transactions, or any and all activities and transactions, with, involving or for the benefit of certain designated Russian and Belarusian entities or individuals (collectively, “Sanctions Targets”); (ii) a specific prohibition on new investment in the Russian energy sector, broadly defined to include the procurement, exploration, extraction, drilling, mining, harvesting, production, refinement, liquefaction, gasification, regasification, conversion, enrichment, fabrication or transport of petroleum, natural gas, liquified natural gas, natural gas liquids, or petroleum products or other products capable of producing energy; and (iii) a broad prohibition on new investment in Russia.​Pursuant to applicable Sanctions, we may be obliged to limit our business activities, may incur costs in order to implement and maintain compliance programs, and may be subject to investigations, enforcement actions or penalties relating to actual or alleged instances of noncompliance with the Sanctions Measures. It may also be necessary for us to take certain actions, including suspending or winding down our operations in Russia, in order to maintain compliance with, or satisfy obligations under, applicable Sanctions.​We are committed to compliance with all applicable Sanctions and have implemented and maintain dedicated policies and procedures that we believe to be customary and appropriate to promote and maintain our compliance with applicable Sanctions. However, we can provide no assurances that these policies and procedures will always be effective in identifying Sanctions Targets and their property interests or in preventing violations of applicable Sanctions by us or employees, agents or other persons acting on our behalf.​The full scale of the impact of the Sanctions Measures and Russia’s responses to the Sanctions Measures (such as counter-sanctions and the potential nationalization of assets in Russia) is currently unclear but such developments could adversely affect our operations and the oil and gas sector generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, U.S. and other governments have increased their oversight and enforcement activities with respect to Sanctions laws and regulations and it is expected that the relevant agencies will continue to increase these investigative and enforcement activities. A violation of Sanctions could result in severe criminal or civil penalties and reputational harm, which could separately adversely affect our business and results of operations.25Table of Contents​We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.​We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations and the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States and in jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized, and any such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations in the periods in which such laws and regulations become effective as well as in future periods.  Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense is incurred. If these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax effects of our significant corporate restructuring transactions.​On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15% corporate minimum tax rate applied to certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022.  We do not expect the IRA to have a material impact to the Company.​The Organization Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) introduced Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS”) Pillar 2 rules that impose a global minimum tax rate of 15%. Numerous countries, including European Union member states, have enacted or are expected to enact legislation to be effective as early as January 1, 2024, with general implementation of a global minimum tax by January 1, 2025. There are no impacts to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. ​On December 18, 2023, Bermuda enacted a 15% corporate income tax regime (the “Bermuda CIT”) that applies to Bermuda businesses that are part of multinational enterprise groups with annual revenue of €750 million or more and is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2025. As a result of the Bermuda CIT, the Company’s exemption from Bermuda corporate income taxes will cease in 2025. With the enactment of the Bermuda CIT in 2023, the Company underwent an analysis to determine the tax impacts to its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2023. Bermuda CIT allows for a beginning net operating loss balance related to the five years preceding the effective date of Bermuda CIT.  We have recorded a deferred tax asset of $171.9 million for the Bermuda net operating losses generated from 2020 through 2023 with an offsetting valuation allowance of $171.9 million. ​The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.​As of December 31, 2023, the Company reported consolidated federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $588.9 million and certain other favorable federal income tax attributes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards and certain other attributes may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). An ownership change generally occurs if there is a more than 50 percentage point increase in the aggregate equity ownership of the Company by one or more “5 percent shareholders” (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change, measured against their lowest percentage ownership at any time during such period.​There is no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of future actions that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes. Potential future transactions involving the sale, issuance, redemption or other disposition of common or preferred shares or other equity-based securities, the exercise of conversion or exchange options under the terms of any convertible or exchangeable debt, the repurchase of any such debt with Company shares, in each case, by a person owning, or treated as owning, 5% or more of the Company’s shares, or a combination of such transactions, may cause or increase the possibility that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382. Under Section 382, an ownership change would subject the Company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs (and certain other tax attributes) that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. If a Section 382 limitation applies, the limitation could cause the Company’s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be 26Table of Contentspaid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause a portion of the Company’s tax attributes to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. ​Share Capital and Corporate Structure Risks​Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.​As of February 6, 2024, we had 32,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 10,633,331 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, including 1,161,283 million held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 406,235 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans, 3,937,641 shares are reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants and 1,441,075 shares were reserved for issuance under the 1.75% senior exchangeable notes due 2029. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options or warrants (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of our 1.75% Exchangeable Notes due 2029, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.​Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.​The trading price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:​●variations in quarterly operating results;​●deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance; ​●variability in our revenues;​●our announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; ​●general conditions in and market perceptions of the oil and gas industry; ​●uncertainty about current global economic conditions; ​●investor sentiment about our company and industry;​●fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and ​●other general economic conditions. ​The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts, and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.​During 2023, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $190.90 per common share to a low of $75.64 per common share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our common shares in the future.​27Table of ContentsProvisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.​Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:​●Authorizing our board of directors (the “Board”) to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;​●Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;​●Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;​●Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and​●Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.​Certain actions taken by us could make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. For instance, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board and in 2017, as recommended by our shareholders, we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates. Conversely, the provisions designed to prevent hostile takeovers, or protect holders of our debt instruments and our joint venture partner, may deter transactions in which shareholders would receive a change of control premium. For example, certain change of control transactions could accelerate the principal amounts outstanding, and require premiums payments, under our debt instruments, or trigger a call option to purchase our interest in SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco.​As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries, and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. Our debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by the laws of the applicable subsidiaries’ jurisdictions of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources.​General  Risks​Investor sentiment and public perception related to the fossil fuels industry and to ESG initiatives could affect the demand for our services, increase our costs of capital, our reporting requirement, and our operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.​Regulators, investor advocacy groups, investment funds, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters and have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. Investor sentiment and the public perception of fossil fuels have led to calls to limit investment and lending to businesses in our industry. As a service provider to energy companies in the fossil fuel 28Table of Contentsindustry, if any of these efforts continue or increase, our ability to raise capital could be negatively affected, which could lead to a reduction in our stock price.​Similarly, there are calls by certain investors for companies to increase their ESG initiatives, and for more robust reporting on such initiatives. The European Union has implemented ESG reporting requirements on EU market participants, and similar regulations are pending in various states in the United States. Standards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve, and our business may be impacted by new laws and regulations or investor criteria in the U.S., the European Union, and around the world, related to ESG. Members of the investment community and lenders have also begun establishing standards required of companies in which they invest or to which they provide credit. Certain of our institutional investors use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company’s ESG practices in an increasingly broad set of matters including but not limited to, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human capital, labor, product certification and risk oversight. Such scoring and examination may expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. In addition to potential impacts on our operations, the cost of complying with such scrutiny by institutional investors, as well as any new laws and regulations, including building appropriate compliance and reporting functions within our company, could be significant and may increase our costs of operations and thereby negatively affect our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of our investors or our lenders, our cost of capital may increase and our stock price may be negatively affected.​We intend to set certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity, and other matters. Our intention to set certain ESG-related initiatives and goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. These initiatives, goals, or commitments could result in unexpected expenses, changes in our relationships with strategic partners, distributors and third-party service providers, loss of revenue or business disruption. We could fail to achieve, or may be perceived to fail to achieve, ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments and we may be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.​Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including COVID-19 and its’ various variants, and future adverse effects could be material and difficult to predict.​The global spread of the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 and its variants, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, impacted our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers. The outbreak triggered a sharp sell-off in energy commodities markets during the first quarter of 2020, as economic activity tumbled as a result of government impositions of mandatory closures, quarantines and other restrictions on, or advisories with respect to, travel, business operations and public gatherings or interactions. Other effects of the pandemic included significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets; adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of drilling activities; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions to customer budgets; supply chain disruptions; inflation and other decreases in purchasing power, limitations on access to raw materials; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers. The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected will depend on various factors beyond our control.​Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.​Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services, whether such systems are our own or those of our vendors, service providers or customers. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, and complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. The techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyberattacks and compromise information technology infrastructure, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for some time.  In addition, there has been an increase in state-sponsored cyberattacks, which are often conducted by capable, well-funded groups. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplifies these concerns.  29Table of Contents​Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:​●theft or misappropriation of funds;​●loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary, confidential or personally identifiable information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);​●disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;​●damage to our reputation with our customers and the market;​●the perception of our products or services as having security vulnerabilities;​●exposure to litigation and legal and regulatory costs;​●loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and​●increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.​Any perceived or actual electronic or physical security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information, including penetration of our systems security, whether by us or by a third party, could disrupt our business, damage our reputation and our relationships with our customers or employees, expose us to risks of litigation, significant fines and penalties and liability, result in the deterioration of our customers’ and employees’ confidence in us, and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time. ​We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any breach in the security of our information systems or those of our service providers could lead to an interruption in the operation of our systems or loss, disclosure or misappropriation of our business information or other unintended consequences. Such cyber incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.​The successful execution of our business strategies depends, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel. Competition for such professionals is intense, and as the business environment improves, competition for personnel generally intensifies. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical professionals and talented personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​"
8,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2023-02-09,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.​Risk Factors
 Summary​The following is a summary of the principal risks included in this annual report that we believe could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.​Business and Operational Risks​●Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.●Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.11Table of Contents●We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.●We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.●The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.●Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated on short notice and/or without an early termination payment.●The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.●The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.●We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.●Our contracts with state-owned energy companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.●Control of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may affect the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.●Our operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.●Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.●Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.●Decisions by internet service, cloud hosting service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors.●Failure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.●Our aspirations, goals and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to risks.●We are subject to a number of uncertainties during the timeframe when Nabors Energy Transition Corporation (NETC) pursues a business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.​Financial Risks​●We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.●Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.●Volatility in prices of goods and services and interest rates could expose us to risks in managing our operating and capital costs.●Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.●A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.​Technology Risks​●New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.●Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenues and any competitive advantage we hold.●Technology disputes could negatively affect our operations or increase our costs.12Table of Contents●Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Legal and Regulatory Risks​●Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, international laws and regulations, and compliance obligations and risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Violations of these laws could have a negative effect on our business.●Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations regarding environmental matters or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.●The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could have a negative effect on our business.●We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security.●Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.●Our business may be affected by changes in applicable sanctions or export controls laws and regulations, including those targeting Russia.●We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.●The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.​Share Capital and Corporate Structure Risks​●Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.●Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.●Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, provisions in our organizational documents and in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.●As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​General Risks​●Investor sentiment and public perception related to the fossil fuels industry and to ESG initiatives could affect the demand for our services, increase our costs of capital, our reporting requirements and our operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.●Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse effects could be material and difficult to predict.●Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.●The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.​For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, see below.​Business and Operational Risks​Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.​Our operations, demand for our services, and the rates we are able to charge for such services depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-13Table of Contentsterm trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile for several years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Declines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand, in addition to significant shocks to regional and global economies such as the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia invasion of Ukraine. Worldwide military, political, public health, and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and OPEC+, uncertainty in capital and commodities markets, and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to access capital, and the extent to which they are willing or able to deploy capital, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere) related to the development/production and use of oil and natural gas, levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general and global economic conditions, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, decisions by oil and gas producers to continue producing oil and gas despite excess supply, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, as well as governmental programs that incentivize the use of alternative energy, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, and thereby affect the price of oil and natural gas.​Lower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely affect our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.​Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.​Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or suppliers will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse effect on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material effect on our utilization, dayrates, results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers being unable to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity in deployable assets or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the worldwide economy, under capacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate in the future due to one or more factors.​We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.​The oilfield services industry is very competitive with a significant amount of excess capacity. The competitive nature of the business is exacerbated in low oil price environments such as the one we have generally experienced over the last decade. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, an important factor in determining job awards is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or dayrates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.​In addition to our performance, our ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers’ future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed 14Table of Contentsmarket conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing dayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.​Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling industry, including environmental pollution, blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage, reputational harm and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including pollution of coastal waters, damage to wildlife and natural habitats, capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding, and unsound ocean bottom conditions. ​Accidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not sufficiently insured or indemnified, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover certain risks. Our insurance also may not cover losses associated with pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the effect of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity.  In addition, our safety record is a competitive advantage for us and if one or more incidents were to occur it could significantly affect this advantage.​Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.​Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract. In certain circumstances, including but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate, or any, compensation. Many of these contracts could be terminated or suspended on short notice further exacerbating the effects on our results.  The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers, including government-controlled entities, seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. Downturns in the oil price environment may result in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be affected by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with 15Table of Contentsor without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we received approximately 36%, 44% and 49%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 26%, 31% and 29% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. Replacing significant customers is difficult.  The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to meet our obligations. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments to us or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market and may cause our counterparties to seek modifications to our contracts with them. Furthermore, potential consolidation among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may reduce the number of available customers.​The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.​We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including operations in the Middle East, South America, the Far East, North Africa, central and southern Asia and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, nationalization, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation, particularly in respect of contracts with state-owned oil companies. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. ​The initiation of conflicts in certain regions or by certain agitators, such as the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, may also lead to the imposition of regulatory sanctions that could limit our ability to operate in a specific region or country.  See, for example, “—Our business may be affected by changes in applicable sanctions or export controls laws and regulations, including those targeting Russia.”​The future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.​Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, labor shortages or other labor-related difficulties, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenues to us, as well as an increase in operating costs.​Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively affected by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, issues with the global supply 16Table of Contentschain whether caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ukraine/Russia conflict or other reasons could make it more difficult for our suppliers to meet our requirements in a timely manner, if at all, which could ultimately result in an adverse effect on our operations.​Our contracts with state-owned energy companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.​We currently own and operate rigs and rig-related equipment under contracts with state-owned energy companies (“NOCs”). In the future, we may expand our international solutions operations and enter into additional, significant contracts with NOCs. The terms of these contracts may contain non-negotiable provisions and may expose us to greater commercial, political, operational and other risks than we assume in other contracts. These contracts may expose us to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, or under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment. We can provide no assurance that increased risk exposure will not have an adverse effect on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted, or the amount of technology deployed, to NOCs with commensurate additional contractual risks. Risks that accompany contracts with NOCs could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ​Control of oil and natural gas reserves by NOCs may affect the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.​Much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by NOCs, which may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely affect our operations in those countries. In addition, while we do not control the actions of our joint venture partners, their actions could have an effect on our investment in the joint ventures and more generally our overall reputation.  In addition, our ability to work with NOCs is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.​Our operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.​Our operating expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of our drilling and related equipment, many of which are not affected by changes in dayrates and some of which are not affected by utilization. During periods of reduced revenues and/or activity, certain of our fixed costs (such as depreciation) may not decline and often we may incur additional costs. During times of reduced utilization, reductions in costs may not be immediate as we may not be able to fully reduce the cost of our support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenues due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in drilling services and solutions expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.​We conduct some operations through joint ventures. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, the joint venture operating in a manner that is contrary to our preference or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any non-performance, default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. Certain of these actions could have adverse consequences for us, legal or regulators issues in the region and/or reputational harm, including our attractiveness as a partner in other regions.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.​17Table of ContentsFailure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.​We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commenced operations in December 2017. The long-term success of the Saudi joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner’s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling rigs and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner.​We also completed the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017. We have been unable to obtain regulatory approvals to recognize our acquisition of the Tesco subsidiary in Russia.  ​The anticipated benefits of the Saudi joint venture, the Tesco acquisition, and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees, or the disposition of certain assets or operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Decisions by internet service, cloud host service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors. ​We utilize the internet to provide services and to promote our business and services to current and potential customers and to provide information and updates to our investors. Internet service providers, cloud hosting services, social media companies and website providers that currently allow us to utilize their platforms to communicate with customers and the public may decide that our business or the industry in which we operate negatively affects their business or may make business decisions or changes to their policies that negatively affect us. Such actions could include placing restrictions on our use of their platforms or banning us from utilizing their services altogether. Our inability to use these platforms may have a negative effect on the way we are perceived in the industry or in the media and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Failure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price. ​Our long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition, which will require adapting our business to potentially changing government requirements and customer and investor preferences, as well as engaging with our customers to develop solutions to decarbonize oil and gas operations. If the energy transition occurs faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted.​Our aspirations, goals and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to risks.​We have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, or other objectives related to sustainability matters. Statements related to these goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved. Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control. Some factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the extent to which our customers' decisions directly impact, relate to, or influence the use of our equipment that creates the emissions we report, (ii) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (ii) evolving regulatory requirements affecting sustainability standards or disclosures, and (iv) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on sustainability matters, including climate-related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls for reporting sustainability matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting such metrics, including sustainability-related disclosures that may be required of public 18Table of Contentscompanies by the SEC, and such standards may change over time, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future. Our business may also face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them. If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected. Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.​We will be subject to a number of uncertainties during the timeframe when Nabors Energy Transition Corporation (NETC) pursues a business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.​If NETC is unable to consummate a suitable business transaction during the prescribed time period set forth in the terms of the initial public offering, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our shareholders. In addition, in the event that NETC is able to find a suitable business combination, or if the business combination is unsuccessful, there is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated value from such transaction.​Financial Risks​We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.​In 2021 and 2020, we recognized impairment charges of  $60.5 million and $390.0 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then-carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.​The 2022 Credit Agreement (as defined) is secured with a first lien security interest on all land drilling rigs and related equipment, spare parts and inventory in the contiguous U.S.  Under the facility, we are required to maintain an “interest coverage ratio” of no less than 1.75:1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022, with such ratio periodically increasing in increments of 0.125:1.00 to a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. We are also required to maintain a “minimum guarantor value” of no less than 90% at all times. The interest coverage ratio is defined to mean the ratio of (i) EBITDA for the latest four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered to (ii) the interest expense for the latest four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered. The minimum guarantor value is defined to mean the percentage of book value of, minus depreciation and amortization on, property, plant and equipment owned by Nabors and its subsidiaries, that is directly or indirectly owned by the guarantors of the 2022 Credit Agreement (other than Nabors) and their wholly owned subsidiaries. The interest coverage ratio and the minimum guarantor value requirement are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ​As of December 31, 2022, our consolidated total outstanding indebtedness was $2.5 billion. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries’ operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under the 2022 Credit Agreement and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. Our amount of indebtedness may make it more difficult to borrow funds in the future.  In addition, if we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, any of which could negatively affect our stock price or financial condition.19Table of Contents​Volatility in prices of goods and services and interest rates could expose us to risks in managing our operating and capital costs.In 2022, inflationary pressures resulting from COVID-19 relief and aid programs, supply chain constraints and generally improved economic conditions increased our costs for commodities, labor, energy and other components necessary to operate our business. We expect these inflationary pressures to continue to impact our margins and more generally, our business in 2023. After almost 10 years of low interest rate environments, inflationary pressures and efforts in the U.S. and around the world to combat inflation have resulted in increased interest rates by central banks globally. As a result, to the extent we incur additional indebtedness the interest rates we are charged may be significantly higher than our interest rates in prior years, which increases our cost to operate our business.  In addition, the 2022 Credit Agreement bears interest at a floating rate and, to the extent we have borrowing outstanding under the facility, the borrowing will bear interest at increased rates compared to our historical rates.  Further, the increased interest rates could affect our clients’ businesses and borrowing costs, which in turn could impact their ability to make payments to us.Our attempts to offset these increasing costs, such as increases in our dayrates and operational improvements, may not be successful. To the extent that our offsetting measures are not sufficient to offset these higher costs, our results of operations may be adversely affected.​Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.​From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited or adversely affected by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, interest rates and the health or market perceptions of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and/or the oil and gas industry, among others, are outside of our control. There have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as pressuring lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, which, if successful, could limit our ability to access capital markets. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.​Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies. Credit rating agencies continually revise their ratings for companies they follow. Any adverse developments in our business and operations could lead to a ratings downgrade to our senior unsecured debt that currently has a non-investment grade rating. Factors that may affect our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and other factors, are also considered by the rating agencies. Any fluctuation in our credit rating, could affect our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources in the future, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Technology Risks​New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.​The market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs and related equipment. 20Table of ContentsAccordingly, we may have to allocate a higher proportion of our capital expenditures to improve the technological aspects of our existing rigs and other equipment, purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs and other equipment to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and develop new and improved technology and data analytics. ​Although a component of our strategy is to develop and use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements on existing technology by competitors could make our equipment less competitive. There can be no assurance that we will:​●have sufficient capital resources to improve existing rigs or build new, technologically advanced drilling rigs;​●avoid cost overruns inherent in large fabrication projects resulting from numerous factors such as shortages or unscheduled delays in delivery of equipment or materials, inadequate levels of skilled labor, unanticipated increases in costs of equipment, materials and labor, design and engineering problems, and financial or other difficulties;​●successfully deploy idle, stacked, new or upgraded drilling rigs;​●effectively manage the size or growth of our organization and drilling fleet;​●develop competitive technologies or choose the right technologies to develop;​●maintain crews necessary to operate existing or additional drilling rigs; or​●successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of improving existing drilling rigs or building new drilling rigs.​In the event that we are successful in developing new technologies for use in our business, there is no guarantee of future demand for those technologies. Customers may be financial incapable or otherwise reluctant or unwilling to adopt our new technologies or may choose competing technologies. We may also have difficulty negotiating satisfactory terms for our technology services or may be unable to secure prices sufficient to obtain expected returns on our investment in the research and development of new technologies.​Development of new technology is critical to maintaining our competitiveness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop technology that our customers demand. If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances and trends (including trends in favor of emissions-reducing technologies) or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner suitable to their needs, demand for our services could decline and we could lose market share. Furthermore, if our equipment or proprietary technologies become obsolete, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, or one or more technologies that we may implement in the future may not work as we expect and our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected as a result. If competing technologies are viewed as superior to ours it could affect our competitiveness.  Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could reduce our competitiveness and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenues and any competitive advantage we hold.​There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.21Table of Contents​Technology disputes could negatively affect our operations or increase our costs.​Our services and products use proprietary technology and equipment, which can involve potential infringement of a third party’s rights, or a third party’s infringement of our rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs and related services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors. However, in the event that we or one of our customers or supplying vendors becomes involved in a dispute over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment or technology owned or used by us, services performed by us or products provided by us, we may lose access to important equipment or technology or our ability to provide services or products, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or technology or be forced to invest or develop replacement technologies to enhance our equipment, technology, services or products. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or technology or provision of services or products. In addition, we may lose a competitive advantage in the event we are unsuccessful in enforcing our rights against third parties. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Technology disputes involving us or our customers or supplying vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.​Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Since our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies that increase the effectiveness (economic or otherwise), use or availability of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Legal and Regulatory Risks ​Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, international laws and regulations, and compliance obligations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws.​Our international business (including our participation in joint ventures, requirements for local content, and our global supply chain) is subject to numerous political and economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally.  Our international business is generally subject to both U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to export/import controls, sanctions, technology transfers, government contracts and procurement, data privacy and protection, investment, exchange rates and controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the Bermuda Bribery Act (2016) and other anti-corruption laws, anti-boycott provisions, securities laws, labor and employment, works councils and other labor groups, anti-human trafficking, taxes, environment, immunity, security restrictions and intellectual property. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs designed to promote and achieve compliance, we cannot ensure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from risks associated with unlawful acts carried out by our employees or agents. ​Failure by us, our employees, affiliates, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges. Any such penalty could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.​Our international operations also subject us to other risks, including potential asset seizure, terrorist acts, piracy, kidnapping, nationalization of assets, currency restrictions, import or export quotas, tariffs and other forms of public and government regulation, all of which are beyond our control. Economic sanctions or an oil embargo, for example, could have significant impact on activity in the oil and natural gas industry and, correspondingly, us should we operate in an 22Table of Contentsarea subject to any sanctions or embargo, or in the surrounding region to the extent any sanctions or embargo disrupts its operations.Changes to, or noncompliance with laws and regulations regarding environmental matters or exposure to environmental liabilities, could adversely affect our results of operations. ​Drilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health, such as those regulating the spill, release, transport, storage, use, treatment, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and solid wastes and materials. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not able to allocate all risks of environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. ​In addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks. ​Changes in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively affect the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations.​The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a negative effect on our business.​There has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (“GHG”), including carbon dioxide and methane, emissions and climate change issues. Future regulation could require industries to meet stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. In addition, the current administration has taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.​The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has published findings that GHG emissions present an endangerment to public health and the environment. The EPA has also issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. In November 2021, the EPA proposed new rules aimed at sharply reducing methane and other emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and gas industry. The Bureau of Land Management also issued a rule in November 2016 requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands.​The United States is a member of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (“COP 21”) in Paris, that set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Paris Agreement requires set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Stronger GHG emission targets were set at the Conference of Parties in Glasgow (“COP 26”) in November 2021.​It is not possible to predict the timing and effect of climate change or whether additional GHG regulations will be adopted. However, more aggressive efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely, and any such future regulations could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or affect the demand for our customers’ products and, accordingly, our services. ​23Table of ContentsIn addition, there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Further, members of the investment community have increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, and an increasing number of our customers consider sustainability factors in awarding work. These developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards lower carbon energy sources such as wind, solar and other renewables. If these efforts are successful, our ability and the ability of our customers to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively affected.​Further, the federal government and certain state governments have enacted, and are expected to continue to enact, laws and regulations that mandate or provide economic incentives for the development of technologies and sources of energy other than oil and gas, such as wind and solar. Such legislation incentivizes the development, use and investment in these technologies and alternative energy sources and could accelerate the shift away from traditional oil and gas. For example, the Inflation Reduction Act (""IRA"") of 2022 contains tax inducements and other provisions that incentivize investment, development, and deployment of alternative energy sources and technologies. Also, in 2022, California mandated that all new passenger cars and light trucks sold in the state be electric vehicles or other emissions-free models by 2035. If these future laws and regulations result in customers reducing their production of oil and gas, they could ultimately have an adverse effect on our business and prospects.​Beyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect our facilities and operations and those of our customers. ​We are subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security.​Governments around the world have implemented, and continue to implement, laws and regulations regarding data privacy and security, including with respect to the protection and processing of personal data. These laws and regulations vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and we are obligated to comply in all jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability, including fines, penalties, and potential criminal sanctions.​Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.​We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See “Item 3—Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings.​Our business may be affected by changes in applicable sanctions or export controls laws and regulations, including those targeting Russia.Our international operations expose us to compliance obligations and risks under applicable economic sanctions, export controls and trade embargoes, such as those imposed, administered and enforced by the United States and the United Kingdom and other relevant sanctions authorities (collectively, “Sanctions”). In response to ongoing military hostilities between Russia and Ukraine, the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and other jurisdictions imposed new and additional economic sanctions, export controls and other trade restrictions (“collectively, “Sanctions Measures”) targeting Russia, Belarus and certain regions of Ukraine, including Sanctions Measures that impose: (i) restrictions on engaging in specified activities or transactions, or any and all activities and transactions, with, involving or for the benefit of certain designated Russian and Belarusian entities or individuals (collectively, “Sanctions Targets”); (ii) a specific prohibition on new investment in the Russian energy sector, broadly defined to include the procurement, exploration, extraction, drilling, mining, harvesting, production, refinement, liquefaction, gasification, regasification, conversion, enrichment, fabrication or transport of petroleum, natural gas, liquified natural gas, natural gas liquids, or petroleum products or other products capable of producing energy; and (iii) a broad prohibition on new investment in Russia.24Table of ContentsPursuant to applicable Sanctions, we may be obliged to limit our business activities, may incur costs in order to implement and maintain compliance programs, and may be subject to investigations, enforcement actions or penalties relating to actual or alleged instances of noncompliance with the Sanctions Measures. It may also be necessary for us to take certain actions, including suspending or winding down our operations in Russia, in order to maintain compliance with, or satisfy obligations under, applicable Sanctions.We are committed to compliance with all applicable Sanctions and have implemented and maintain dedicated policies and procedures that we believe to be customary and appropriate to promote and maintain our compliance with applicable Sanctions. However, we can provide no assurances that these policies and procedures will always be effective in identifying Sanctions Targets and their property interests or in preventing violations of applicable Sanctions by us or employees, agents or other persons acting on our behalf.The full scale of the impact of the Sanctions Measures and Russia’s responses to the Sanctions Measures (such as counter-sanctions and the potential nationalization of assets in Russia) is currently unclear but such developments could adversely affect our operations and the oil and gas sector generally, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flow. In addition, U.S. and other governments have increased their oversight and enforcement activities with respect to Sanctions laws and regulations and it is expected that the relevant agencies will continue to increase these investigative and enforcement activities. A violation of Sanctions could result in severe criminal or civil penalties and reputational harm, which could separately adversely affect our business and results of operations.We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.​We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations and the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States and in jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized, and any such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations in the periods in which such laws and regulations become effective as well as in future periods. In October 2021, the Group of 20 endorsed a new global minimum tax rate for large multinational companies, which also has the support of a large number of countries and territories responsible for the overwhelming majority of global economic output. To take effect, the minimum tax would need to be implemented by each jurisdiction. It is not yet clear how such a minimum tax would impact our business.​The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”) adopted sweeping changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and numerous other changes, the law imposes more stringent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and net operating losses and imposes a type of minimum tax designed to reduce the benefits derived from intercompany transactions and payments that result in base erosion. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense is incurred. Although the Tax Reform Act has not had a material effect on our financial statements to date, if these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax effects of our significant corporate restructuring transactions.​On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act (“IRA”) was signed into law in the United States. Among other provisions, the IRA includes a 15% corporate minimum tax rate applied to certain large corporations and a 1% excise tax on corporate stock repurchases made after December 31, 2022.  We do not expect the IRA to have a material impact to the Company. ​The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.​As of December 31, 2022, the Company reported consolidated federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $727.1 million and certain other favorable federal income tax attributes. The Company’s ability to use its 25Table of ContentsNOL carryforwards and certain other attributes may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). An ownership change generally occurs if there is a more than 50 percentage point increase in the aggregate equity ownership of the Company by one or more “5 percent shareholders” (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change, measured against their lowest percentage ownership at any time during such period.​There is no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of future actions that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards and potentially certain other tax attributes. Potential future transactions involving the sale, issuance, redemption or other disposition of common or preferred shares or other equity-based securities, the exercise of conversion or exchange options under the terms of any convertible or exchangeable debt, the repurchase of any such debt with Company shares, in each case, by a person owning, or treated as owning, 5% or more of the Company’s shares, or a combination of such transactions, may cause or increase the possibility that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382. Under Section 382, an ownership change would subject the Company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs (and possibly certain other tax attributes) that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. If a Section 382 limitation applies, the limitation could cause the Company’s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause a portion of the Company’s tax attributes to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. ​Share Capital and Corporate Structure Risks​Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.​As of February 6, 2023, we had 32,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 10,546,387 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, including 1,090,003 million held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 493,601 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans and 3,937,659 shares are reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options or warrants (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of our 0.75% Exchangeable Notes due 2024, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.​Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.​The trading price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:​●variations in quarterly operating results;​●deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance; ​●variability in our revenues;​●our announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; ​●general conditions in and market perceptions of the oil and gas industry; ​●uncertainty about current global economic conditions; ​●investor sentiment about our company and industry;​●fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and ​●other general economic conditions. ​26Table of ContentsThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts, and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.​During 2022, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $200.02 per common share to a low of $90.95 per common share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our common shares in the future.​Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.​Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:​●Authorizing our board of directors (the “Board”) to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;​●Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;​●Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;​●Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and​●Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.​Certain actions taken by us could make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. For instance, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board and in 2017, as recommended by our shareholders, we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates. Conversely, the provisions designed to prevent hostile takeovers, or protect holders of our debt instruments and our joint venture partner, may deter transactions in which shareholders would receive a change of control premium. For example, certain change of control transactions could accelerate the principal amounts outstanding, and require premiums payments, under our debt instruments, or trigger a call option to purchase our interest in SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco.​As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries, and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. Our debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by the laws of the applicable subsidiaries’ jurisdictions of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make 27Table of Contentspayments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources.​General  Risks​Investor sentiment and public perception related to the fossil fuels industry and to ESG initiatives could affect the demand for our services, increase our costs of capital, our reporting requirement, and our operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.​Regulators, investor advocacy groups, investment funds, and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) matters and have placed increasing importance on the non-financial impacts of their investments. Investor sentiment and the public perception of fossil fuels have led to calls to limit investment and lending to businesses in our industry. As a service provider to energy companies in the fossil fuel industry, if any of these efforts continue or increase, our ability to raise capital could be negatively affected, which could lead to a reduction in our stock price.Similarly, there are calls by certain investors for companies to increase their ESG initiatives, and for more robust reporting on such initiatives. The European Union has implemented ESG reporting requirements on EU market participants, and similar regulations are pending in various states in the United States. Standards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve, and our business may be impacted by new laws and regulations or investor criteria in the U.S., the European Union, and around the world, related to ESG. Members of the investment community and lenders have also begun establishing standards required of companies in which they invest or to which they provide credit. Certain of our institutional investors use third-party benchmarks or scores to measure a company’s ESG practices in an increasingly broad set of matters including but not limited to, environmental sustainability (including climate change), human capital, labor, product certification and risk oversight. Such scoring and examination may expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. In addition to potential impacts on our operations, the cost of complying with such scrutiny by institutional investors, as well as any new laws and regulations, including building appropriate compliance and reporting functions within our company, could be significant and may increase our costs of operations and thereby negatively affect our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of our investors or our lenders, our cost of capital may increase and our stock price may be negatively affected.We intend to set certain ESG-related initiatives, goals, and/or commitments regarding environmental matters, diversity, and other matters. Our intention to set certain ESG-related initiatives and goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. These initiatives, goals, or commitments could result in unexpected expenses, changes in our relationships with strategic partners, distributors and third-party service providers, loss of revenue or business disruption. We could fail to achieve, or may be perceived to fail to achieve, ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments and we may be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of these initiatives, goals, or commitments, or for any revisions to them. Our actual or perceived failure to achieve our ESG-related initiatives, goals, or commitments could negatively impact our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse effects could be material and difficult to predict.​The global spread of the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 and its variants, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, impacted our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers. The outbreak triggered a sharp sell-off in energy commodities markets during the first quarter of 2020, as economic activity tumbled as a result of government impositions of mandatory closures, quarantines and other restrictions on, or advisories with respect to, travel, business operations and public gatherings or interactions. Other effects of the pandemic included, and may continue to include, significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets; adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of drilling activities; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions to customer budgets; supply chain disruptions; inflation and other decreases in purchasing power, limitations on access to raw materials; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers. The pandemic is continuously evolving, and the extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected will depend on various factors beyond our 28Table of Contentscontrol, such as the ultimate duration, severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus; the emergence of new variants and strains of the virus; and the success of actions to contain the virus and its variants, or treat its impact, such as the availability and acceptance of vaccines. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.​Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.​Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, and complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:​●theft or misappropriation of funds;​●loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary, confidential or personally identifiable information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);​●disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;​●damage to our reputation with our customers and the market;​●the perception of our products or services as having security vulnerabilities;​●exposure to litigation and legal and regulatory costs;​●loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and​●increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.​Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time. ​We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.​The successful execution of our business strategies depends, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel. Competition for such professionals is intense, and as the business environment improves, competition for personnel generally intensifies. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical professionals and talented personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​"
1,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2022-02-18,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.​Risk Factors
 Summary​The following is a summary of the principal risks included in this annual report that we believe could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.​Business and Operational Risks​●Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.●Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.●We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.●We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.●The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.●Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.●The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.●The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.●We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.●Our contracts with state-owned energy companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.●Control of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned energy companies may affect the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.●Our operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.10Table of Contents●Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.●Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.●Decisions by internet service, cloud hosting service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors.●We are subject to a number of uncertainties during the timeframe when Nabors Energy Transition Corporation (NETC) pursues a business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.​Financial Risks​●We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.●Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.●Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.●A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.​Technology Risks​●New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.●Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenues and any competitive advantage we hold.●Technology disputes could negatively affect our operations or increase our costs.●Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Legal and Regulatory Risks​●New and evolving regulations in the countries in which we operate (including the United States) concerning health and safety related to COVID-19 could have a material effect on our business. ●Our international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations, and compliance obligations and risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Violations of these laws could have a negative effect on our business.●Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.●The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could have a negative effect on our business.●Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.●We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.●The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.​Share Capital and Corporate Structure Risks​●Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.●Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.11Table of Contents●Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.●As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​General Risks​●Investor sentiment and public perception related to the fossil fuels industry and to ESG initiatives could increase our costs of capital, our reporting requirements and our operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.●Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse effects could be material and difficult to predict.●Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.●The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.​For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, see below.​Business and Operational Risks​Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.​Our operations, demand for our services, and the rates we are able to charge for such services depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile for several years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. In addition to the COVID-19 outbreak contributing to a significant decline in oil prices in 2020, declines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand. Worldwide military, political, public health, and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and OPEC+, uncertainty in capital and commodities markets, and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to access capital, and the extent to which they are willing or able to deploy capital, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general and global economic conditions, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, decisions by oil and gas producers to continue producing oil and gas despite excess supply, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, and thereby affect the price of oil and natural gas.​Lower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely affect our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.​Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.​Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or suppliers will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse effect on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material effect on our results of 12Table of Contentsoperations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the worldwide economy, under capacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate in the future due to one or more factors.​We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.​The oilfield services industry is very competitive with a significant amount of excess capacity, especially in low oil price environments. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, an important factor in determining job awards is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.​Our ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers’ future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing dayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.​Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling industry, including environmental pollution, blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including pollution of coastal waters, damage to wildlife and natural habitats, capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding, and unsound ocean bottom conditions. ​Accidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not sufficiently insured or indemnified, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover certain risks. Our insurance also may not cover losses associated with pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the effect of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity.13Table of Contents​Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.​Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract. In certain circumstances, including but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. Downturns in the oil price environment may result in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be affected by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received approximately 44%, 49% and 41%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 31%, 29% and 22% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market and may cause our counterparties to seek modifications to our contracts with them. Furthermore, potential consolidation among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may reduce the number of available customers.​The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.​We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including operations in the Middle East, South America, the Far East, North Africa, central and southern Asia, and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, nationalization, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation, particularly in respect of contracts with state-owned oil companies. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. ​The future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.14Table of Contents​We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.​Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, labor shortages or other labor-related difficulties, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenues to us, as well as an increase in operating costs.​Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively affected by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Our contracts with state-owned energy companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.​We currently own and operate rigs and rig-related equipment under contracts with state-owned energy companies (“NOCs”). In the future, we may expand our international solutions operations and enter into additional, significant contracts with NOCs. The terms of these contracts may contain non-negotiable provisions and may expose us to greater commercial, political, operational and other risks than we assume in other contracts. These contracts may expose us to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, or under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment. We can provide no assurance that increased risk exposure will not have an adverse effect on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted, or the amount of technology deployed, to NOCs with commensurate additional contractual risks. Risks that accompany contracts with NOCs could ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ​Control of oil and natural gas reserves by NOCs may affect the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.​Much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by NOCs, which may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely affect our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with NOCs is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.​Our operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.​Our operating expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of our drilling and related equipment, many of which are not affected by changes in dayrates and some of which are not affected by utilization. During periods of reduced revenues and/or activity, certain of our fixed costs (such as depreciation) may not decline and often we may incur additional costs. During times of reduced utilization, reductions in costs may not be immediate as we may not be able to fully reduce the cost of our support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenues due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in drilling services and solutions expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​15Table of ContentsActions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.​We conduct some operations through joint ventures. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, the joint venture operating in a manner that is contrary to our preference or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.​Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.​We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commenced operations in December 2017. The long-term success of the Saudi joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner’s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling rigs and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner.​We also completed the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017. We have been unable to obtain regulatory approvals to recognize our acquisition of the Tesco subsidiary in Russia.  ​The anticipated benefits of the Saudi joint venture, the Tesco acquisition, and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees, or the disposition of certain assets or operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Decisions by internet service, cloud host service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors. ​We utilize the internet to provide services and to promote our business and services to current and potential customers and to provide information and updates to our investors. Internet service providers, cloud hosting services, social media companies and website providers that currently allow us to utilize their platforms to communicate with customers and the public may decide that our business or the industry in which we operate negatively affects their business or may make business decisions or changes to their policies that negatively affect us. Such actions could include placing restrictions on our use of their platforms or banning us from utilizing their services altogether. Our inability to use these platforms may have a negative effect on the way we are perceived in the industry or in the media and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​We will be subject to a number of uncertainties during the timeframe when Nabors Energy Transition Corporation (NETC) pursues a business combination, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and share price.​If NETC is unable to consummate a suitable business transaction during the prescribed time period set forth in the terms of the initial public offering, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from our shareholders. In addition, in the event that NETC is able to find a suitable business combination, or if the business combination is unsuccessful, there is no assurance that we will realize the anticipated value from such transaction.​Financial Risks​We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.​In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized impairment charges of $60.5 million, $390.0 million and $290.5 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then-carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at 16Table of Contentsthe time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet.​Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.​The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (as hereinafter defined) was fully refinanced by the 2022 Credit Agreement (as hereinafter defined) on January 21, 2022. The 2022 Credit Agreement is secured with a first lien security interest on all land drilling rigs and related equipment, spare parts and inventory in the contiguous U.S.  Under the facility, we are required to maintain an “interest coverage ratio” of no less than 1.75:1.00 as of the last day of the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022, with such ratio periodically increasing in increments of 0.125:1.00 to a minimum interest coverage ratio of 2.75:1.00 as of the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. We are also required to maintain a “minimum guarantor value” of no less than 90% at all times. The interest coverage ratio is defined to mean the ratio of (i) EBITDA for the latest four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered to (ii) the interest expense for the latest four fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered. The minimum guarantor value is defined to mean the percentage of book value of, minus depreciation and amortization on, property, plant and equipment owned by Nabors and its subsidiaries, that is directly or indirectly owned by the guarantors of the 2022 Credit Agreement (other than Nabors) and their wholly owned subsidiaries. The interest coverage ratio and the minimum guarantor value requirement are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ​As of December 31, 2021, our consolidated total outstanding indebtedness was $3.3 billion. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries’ operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under the 2022 Credit Agreement and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, any of which could negatively affect our stock price or financial condition.​Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.​From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited or adversely affected by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, interest rates and the health or market perceptions of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets, the state of the economy and/or the oil and gas industry, and the impact of COVID-19, among others, are outside of our control. There have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as pressuring lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, which, if successful, could limit our ability to access capital markets. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively affect our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.​Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may affect our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19, are also considered by the rating agencies. Our senior unsecured debt has a non-investment grade rating. Ratings downgrades may affect our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​​​17Table of ContentsTechnology Risks​New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.​The market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs and related equipment. Accordingly, we may have to allocate a higher proportion of our capital expenditures to maintain and improve existing rigs and other equipment, purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs and other equipment to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers and develop new and improved technology and data analytics. ​Although we take measures to ensure that we develop and use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements by competitors could make our equipment less competitive. There can be no assurance that we will:​●have sufficient capital resources to improve existing rigs or build new, technologically advanced drilling rigs;​●avoid cost overruns inherent in large fabrication projects resulting from numerous factors such as shortages or unscheduled delays in delivery of equipment or materials, inadequate levels of skilled labor, unanticipated increases in costs of equipment, materials and labor, design and engineering problems, and financial or other difficulties;​●successfully deploy idle, stacked, new or upgraded drilling rigs;​●effectively manage the size or growth of our organization and drilling fleet;​●maintain crews necessary to operate existing or additional drilling rigs; or​●successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of improving existing drilling rigs or building new drilling rigs.​In the event that we are successful in developing new technologies for use in our business, there is no guarantee of future demand for those technologies. Customers may be reluctant or unwilling to adopt our new technologies. We may also have difficulty negotiating satisfactory terms for our technology services or may be unable to secure prices sufficient to obtain expected returns on our investment in the research and development of new technologies.​Development of new technology is critical to maintaining our competitiveness. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop technology that our customers demand. If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances and trends (including trends in favor of emissions-reducing technologies) or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner suitable to their needs, demand for our services could decline and we could lose market share. Furthermore, if our equipment or proprietary technologies become obsolete, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, or one or more technologies that we may implement in the future may not work as we expect and our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected as a result. Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could reduce our competitiveness and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenues and any competitive advantage we hold.​There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our 18Table of Contentstechnology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Technology disputes could negatively affect our operations or increase our costs.​Our services and products use proprietary technology and equipment, which can involve potential infringement of a third party’s rights, or a third party’s infringement of our rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs and related services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors. However, in the event that we or one of our customers or supplying vendors becomes involved in a dispute over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment or technology owned or used by us, services performed by us or products provided by us, we may lose access to important equipment or technology or our ability to provide services or products, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or technology or be forced to invest or develop replacement technologies to enhance our equipment, technology, services or products. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or technology or provision of services or products. In addition, we may lose a competitive advantage in the event we are unsuccessful in enforcing our rights against third parties. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Technology disputes involving us or our customers or supplying vendors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.​Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Since our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Legal and Regulatory Risks ​New and evolving regulations in the countries in which we operate (including the United States) concerning health and safety related to COVID-19 could have a material effect on our business.​The COVID-19 pandemic has caused governments across the globe to implement laws and restrictions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and ensuring the safety of their citizens. In the United States, the federal government issued a vaccination mandate covering federal contractors (Executive Order 14042), and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) announced the implementation of the Vaccination and Testing Emergency Temporary Standard (the “ETS”), requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require unvaccinated workers to obtain a COVID-19 test at least once a week. The Supreme Court enjoined the ETS on January 13, 2022, after which, effective January 26, 2022, OSHA withdrew the measure. OSHA continues to pursue imposition of a similar, permanent requirement through the rulemaking process. This process is not complete and, as such, the final form of OSHA’s rule regarding workplace vaccinations is not known. Executive Order 14042 is currently enjoined by court orders, and the ultimate outcome of such litigation is not known. Therefore, it is not clear at this time how either OSHA’s rule or Executive Order 14042, if enforced, may affect our workforce and our ability to maintain our operations throughout the United States. ​Similarly, laws in other jurisdictions where we operate require individuals to demonstrate proof of vaccination, negative COVID-19 tests, or have other requirements intended to halt or slow the spread of COVID-19, and may restrict travel to, through, and/or from such countries. These travel restrictions may significantly affect our global workforce. If our employees are not able to provide evidence consistent with local requirements and are not allowed to travel to the work location, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.​19Table of ContentsOur international business exposes us to additional risks, including risks related to geopolitical and economic factors, laws and regulations, and compliance obligations and risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws. Violations of these laws could have a negative effect on our business.​Our international business (including our participation in joint ventures, requirements for local content, and our global supply chain) is subject to numerous political and economic factors, legal requirements, cross-cultural considerations and other risks associated with doing business globally.  Our international business is generally subject to both U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation, laws and regulations relating to export/import controls, sanctions, technology transfers, government contracts and procurement, data privacy and protection, investment, exchange rates and controls, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), the Bermuda Bribery Act (2016) and other anti-corruption laws, anti-boycott provisions, securities laws, labor and employment, works councils and other labor groups, anti-human trafficking, taxes, environment, immunity, security restrictions and intellectual property. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs designed to promote and achieve compliance, we cannot ensure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from risks associated with unlawful acts carried out by our employees or agents. ​Failure by us, our employees, affiliates, partners or others with whom we work to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, commercial or criminal liabilities, including suspension or debarment from government contracts or suspension of export/import privileges. Any such penalty could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to compete for other contracts and our financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.​Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. ​Drilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health, including those regulating the spill, release, transport, storage, use, treatment, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, hazardous and solid wastes and materials. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not able to allocate all risks of environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. ​In addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks. ​Changes in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively affect the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations.​The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a negative effect on our business.​There has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (“GHG”), including carbon dioxide and methane, emissions and climate change issues. Future regulation could require industries to meet stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG 20Table of Contentsemissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. In addition, the current administration has taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement.​The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has published findings that GHG emissions present an endangerment to public health and the environment. The EPA has also issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. In November 2021, the EPA proposed new rules aimed at sharply reducing methane and other emissions from new and existing sources in the oil and gas industry. The Bureau of Land Management also issued a rule in November 2016 requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands.​The United States is a member of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (“COP 21”) in Paris, that set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Paris Agreement requires set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Stronger GHG emission targets were set at the Conference of Parties in Glasgow (“COP 26”) in November 2021.​It is not possible to predict the timing and effect of climate change or whether additional GHG regulations will be adopted. However, more aggressive efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely, and any such future regulations could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or affect the demand for our customers’ products and, accordingly, our services. ​In addition, there have been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Further, members of the investment community have increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry, including practices related to GHGs and climate change, and an increasing number of our customers consider sustainability factors in awarding work. These developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards lower carbon energy sources such as wind, solar and other renewables. If these efforts are successful, our ability and the ability of our customers to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively affected.​Beyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect our facilities and operations and those of our customers. ​Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.​We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See “Item 3—Legal Proceedings” for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings.​We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.​We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations and the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States and in jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized, and any such changes could have a material effect on our results of operations in the periods in which such laws and regulations become effective as well as in future periods. In October 2021, the Group of 20 endorsed a new global minimum tax rate for large multinational companies, which also has the support of a large number of countries and territories responsible for the overwhelming majority of global economic output. To take effect, the minimum tax would need to be implemented by each jurisdiction. It is not yet clear how such a minimum tax would impact our business.​The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”) adopted sweeping changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and numerous other changes, the law imposes more stringent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and net operating losses and imposes a type of minimum tax designed to reduce the 21Table of Contentsbenefits derived from intercompany transactions and payments that result in base erosion. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense is incurred. Although the Tax Reform Act has not had a material effect on our financial statements to date, if these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax effects of our significant corporate restructuring transactions.​The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.​As of December 31, 2021, the Company reported consolidated federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $728.6 million and certain other favorable federal income tax attributes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards and certain other attributes may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). An ownership change generally occurs if there is a more than 50 percentage point increase in the aggregate equity ownership of the Company by one or more “5 percent shareholders” (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change, measured against their lowest percentage ownership at any time during such period.​There is no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of future actions that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards and potentially certain other tax attributes. Potential future transactions involving the sale, issuance, redemption or other disposition of common or preferred shares or other equity-based securities, the exercise of conversion or exchange options under the terms of any convertible or exchangeable debt, the repurchase of any such debt with Company shares, in each case, by a person owning, or treated as owning, 5% or more of the Company’s shares, or a combination of such transactions, may cause or increase the possibility that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382. Under Section 382, an ownership change would subject the Company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs (and possibly certain other tax attributes) that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. If a Section 382 limitation applies, the limitation could cause the Company’s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the Company’s NOL carryforwards to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. The Company’s NOL carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full.​Share Capital and Corporate Structure Risks​Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.​As of February 14, 2022, we had 32,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 9,661,352 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, including 1,090,003 million held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 350,067 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options or warrants (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of our 0.75% Exchangeable Notes due 2024, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.​Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.​The trading price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:​●variations in quarterly operating results;22Table of Contents​●deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance; ​●variability in our revenues;​●our announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; ​●general conditions in and market perceptions of the oil and gas industry; ​●uncertainty about current global economic conditions; ​●fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and ​●other general economic conditions. ​The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts, and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.​During 2021, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $130.49 per common share to a low of $57.34 per common share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our common shares in the future.​Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.​Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:​●Authorizing our board of directors (the “Board”) to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;​●Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;​​●Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;​●Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and​●Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.​Certain actions taken by us could make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. For instance, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board and in 2017, as recommended by our shareholders, we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates. Conversely, the provisions designed to prevent hostile takeovers, or protect holders of our debt instruments and our joint venture partner, 23Table of Contentsmay deter transactions in which shareholders would receive a change of control premium. For example, certain change of control transactions could accelerate the principal amounts outstanding, and require premiums payments, under our debt instruments, or trigger a call option to purchase our interest in SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco.​As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries, and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. Our debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by the laws of the applicable subsidiaries’ jurisdictions of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources.​General  Risks​Investor sentiment and public perception related to the fossil fuels industry and to ESG initiatives could increase our costs of capital, our reporting requirement, and our operations, which could negatively affect our stock price.​We are a service provider to energy companies in the fossil fuel industry. Investor sentiment and public perception of fossil fuels have led to calls to limit investment and lending to businesses in this industry. If any of these efforts continue or increase, our ability to raise capital could be negatively affected, which could lead to a reduction in our stock price. ​Similarly, there are calls by certain investors for companies to increase their environment, social, and governance (“ESG”) initiatives, and for more robust reporting on such initiatives. The European Union has implemented ESG reporting requirements on EU market participants, and similar regulations are pending in various states in the United States. Members of the investment community and lenders have also begun establishing standards required of companies in which they invest or to which they provide credit. We anticipate these reporting requirements will continue and potentially increase. Increased ESG efforts and reporting requirements may increase our costs of operations and thereby negatively affect our financial condition. In addition, if we are unable to meet the requirements of our investors or our lenders, our cost of capital may increase and our stock price may be negatively affected.​Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely affected by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse effects could be material and difficult to predict.​The global spread of the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 and its variants, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has adversely affected our operations and the operations of our customers and suppliers. The outbreak triggered a sharp sell-off in energy commodities markets during the first quarter of 2020, as economic activity tumbled as a result of government impositions of mandatory closures, quarantines and other restrictions on, or advisories with respect to, travel, business operations and public gatherings or interactions. Certain jurisdictions recently have begun re-opening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases, while other jurisdictions are continuing to re-open or have nearly completed the re-opening process despite increases in COVID-19 cases. The pandemic may significantly worsen during the upcoming months, which may cause governmental authorities to reconsider restrictions on business, travel, and other activities. ​The significant weakness in oil and natural gas prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in sharp reductions in the exploration and production capital and operating budgets of our customers. Demand for our services and associated product offerings, and the rates we are able to charge to customers, is closely tied to such exploration and production activities and the significant price weakness and associated volatility surrounding these events has had, and is likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on the demand for our services.24Table of Contents​Future increases in commodity prices may not necessarily translate into the resumption of exploration and production activities (and a corresponding demand for our services) because our customers’ expectations of future prices may also influence or limit their activity. As a result of these factors, lower demand for drilling and drilling related services may persist for a significant time, which would continue to materially adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers and the demand for our services.​The spread of the virus into our workforce may also prevent us from meeting the demands of our customers in the future. For example, if the COVID-19 pandemic were to significantly affect a location where we have a high concentration of business and resources, our local workforce could be affected by the outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations or lead to a shutdown of operations in that location.​Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.​Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, and complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:​●theft or misappropriation of funds;​●loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary, confidential or personally identifiable information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);​●disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;​●damage to our reputation with our customers and the market;​●the perception of our products or services as having security vulnerabilities;​●exposure to litigation and legal and regulatory costs;​●loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and​●increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.​Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time. ​We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.​The successful execution of our business strategies depends, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals and talented personnel. Competition for such professionals is intense, and as the business environment improves, competition for personnel generally intensifies. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical professionals and talented personnel, 25Table of Contentscould reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​​"
16,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2021-02-24,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.​Risk Factors
 Summary​The following is a summary of the principal risks included in this annual report that we believe could adversely affect our business, operations, and financial results.​Business and Operational Risks​●Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.●Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.●We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.●We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.●The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.●Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.●The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.●The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.●We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.●Our contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.●Control of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.●Our operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.●Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.10Table of Contents●Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.●Decisions by internet service, cloud hosting service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors.​Financial Risks​●We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.●Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.●Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.​Technology Risks​●New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.●Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.●Technology disputes could negatively impact our operations or increase our costs.●Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Legal and Regulatory Risks​●Changes to United States tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.●The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.●Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.●The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.●Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.​Share Capital and Corporate Structure Risks​●Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.●Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.●Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.●As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​​​​​​​11Table of ContentsGeneral Risks​●Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse impacts could be material and difficult to predict.●Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.●The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.●A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.●Changes in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.●We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.●Our international operations expose us to compliance obligations and risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws, and violations of these laws could have a negative impact on our business.​For a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business, see below.​Business and Operational Risks​Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.​Our operations, demand for our services, and the rates we are able to charge for such services depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile for several years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. In addition to the COVID-19 outbreak contributing to a significant decline in oil prices, declines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand. Worldwide military, political, public health, and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and OPEC+, uncertainty in capital and commodities markets and the ability of oil and natural gas producers to access capital, and the extent to which they are willing or able to deploy capital, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general and global economic conditions, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, decisions by oil and gas producers to continue producing oil and gas despite excess supply, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, and thereby affect the price of oil and natural gas.​Lower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.​Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.​Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or vendors will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices remain at the current relatively low levels or decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse impact on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience 12Table of Contentsdifficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the worldwide economy, under capacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate again in the future due to one or more factors.​We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.​The oilfield services industry is very competitive with a significant amount of excess capacity, especially in low oil price environments. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, an important factor in determining job awards is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.​Our ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers’ future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing dayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.​Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling industry, including environmental pollution, blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including pollution of coastal waters, damage to wildlife and natural habitats, capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding, and unsound ocean bottom conditions. ​Accidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not sufficiently insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all these risks. Our insurance also may not cover losses associated with pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.  Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the impact of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity.​Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.​Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for 13Table of Contentsthe loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances such as, but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. The downturn in the oil price environment resulted in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, resulting in renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be impacted by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we received approximately 49%, 41% and 41%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 29%, 22% and 24% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market and may cause our counterparties to seek modifications to our contracts with them. Furthermore, potential consolidation among oil and natural gas exploration and production companies may reduce the number of available customers.​The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.​We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in the Middle East, South America, the Far East, North Africa and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, nationalization, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation, particularly in respect of contracts with foreign national oil companies. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. ​For example, we previously operated in Venezuela, and were exposed to risks related to political instability there. On January 28, 2019, the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (“PdVSA”) as a Specially Designated National under Executive Order 13850 (the “Order”). The Order prohibited, among other things, business dealings with PdVSA or any entity in which PdVSA owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. We were forced to cease operations in Venezuela, and during the second quarter of 2020 we wrote off all remaining value on our rig and drilling related equipment in the country.​14Table of ContentsThe future occurrence of one or more international events arising from the types of risks described above could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.​Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue to us, as well as an increase in operating costs.​Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively impacted by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Our contracts with national oil companies may expose us to greater risks than we normally assume in contracts with non-governmental customers.​We currently own and operate rigs and rig-related equipment under contracts with foreign national oil companies.  In the future, we may expand our international solutions operations and enter into additional, significant contracts with national oil companies.  The terms of these contracts may contain non-negotiable provisions and may expose us to greater commercial, political, operational and other risks than we assume in other contracts.  Foreign contracts may expose us to materially greater environmental liability and other claims for damages (including consequential damages) and personal injury related to our operations, or the risk that the contract may be terminated by our customer without cause on short-term notice, contractually or by governmental action, or under certain conditions that may not provide us with an early termination payment.  We can provide no assurance that increased risk exposure will not have an adverse impact on our future operations or that we will not increase the number of rigs contracted, or the amount of technology deployed, to national oil companies with commensurate additional contractual risks.  Risks that accompany contracts with national oil companies could ultimately have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. ​Control of oil and natural gas reserves by state-owned oil companies may impact the demand for our services and products and create additional risks in our operations.​Much of the world’s oil and natural gas reserves are controlled by state-owned oil companies. State-owned oil companies may require their contractors to meet local content requirements or other local standards, such as conducting our operations through joint ventures with local partners that could be difficult or undesirable for us to meet. The failure to meet the local content requirements and other local standards may adversely impact our operations in those countries. In addition, our ability to work with state-owned oil companies is subject to our ability to negotiate and agree upon acceptable contract terms.​Our operating expense includes fixed costs that may not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.​Our operating expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of our drilling and related equipment, which are not affected by changes in dayrates and some of which are not affected by utilization.  During periods of reduced revenue and/or activity, certain of our fixed costs (such as depreciation) may not decline and often we may incur additional costs.  During times of reduced utilization, reductions in costs may not be immediate as we may not be able to fully reduce the cost of our support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenue 15Table of Contentsdue to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in drilling services and solutions expense, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Actions of and disputes with our joint venture partners could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.​We conduct some operations through joint venturesl. As with any joint venture arrangement, differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions, the joint venture operating in a manner that is contrary to our preference or in failures to agree on major issues. We also cannot control the actions of our joint venture partners, including any nonperformance, default, or bankruptcy of our joint venture partners. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the business and results of operations of our joint ventures and, in turn, our business and consolidated results of operations.​Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.​We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commenced operations in December, 2017. The long-term success of the Saudi joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner’s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling units and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner.​We also completed the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017. We have been unable to obtain regulatory approvals to recognize our acquisition of the Tesco subsidiary in Russia.  ​The anticipated benefits of the Saudi joint venture, the Tesco acquisition, and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees, or the disposition of certain assets or operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Decisions by internet service, cloud host service and related providers to restrict or ban our ability to use their platforms could adversely affect our ability to promote and conduct our business and inform investors. ​We utilize the internet to provide services and to promote our business and services to current and potential customers and to provide information and updates to our investors. Internet service providers, cloud hosting services, social media companies and website providers that currently allow us to utilize their platforms to communicate with customers and the public may decide that our business or the industry in which we operate negatively impacts their business or may make business decisions or changes to their policies that negatively impact us. Such actions could include placing restrictions on our use of their platforms or banning us from utilizing their services altogether. Our inability to use these platforms may have a negative impact on the way we are perceived in the industry or in the media and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Financial Risks​We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.​In 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized impairment charges of $390.0 million, $290.5 million and $124.9 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet.​16Table of Contents​​Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.​The 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is partially secured with a first lien security interest on drilling rigs in the U.S. and Canada in an amount not less than $545.8 million.  Under the facility, we are required to maintain “minimum liquidity” of no less than $160.0 million at all times, and an asset to debt coverage ratio of at least 4.25:1 as of the end of each calendar quarter.  Minimum liquidity is defined to mean, generally, a consolidated cash balance consisting of (a) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents maintained in a deposit account U.S. or Canadian branch of a commercial bank, plus (b) the lesser of $75 million or an amount equal to 75% of the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents held in deposit account of a commercial bank outside of the U.S. or Canada, plus (c) available commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The asset-to-debt coverage ratio is calculated by dividing (x) drilling-related fixed assets wholly owned by certain of Nabors’ subsidiaries that are guaranteeing the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘2018 Revolver Guarantors’’) or wholly owned subsidiaries of the 2018 Revolver Guarantors by (y) the commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness up to $100 million. The asset to debt coverage ratio applies only during the period which Nabors Delaware fails to maintain an investment grade rating from at least two rating agencies, which was the case as of the date of this report. The minimum liquidity requirement and the asset-to-debt coverage ratio are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ​As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated total outstanding indebtedness was $3.0 billion. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries’ operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, any of which could negatively impact our stock price or financial condition.​Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.​From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited or adversely affected by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, interest rates and the health or market perceptions of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, including the liquidity of the overall capital markets, the state of the economy and oil and gas industry and the impact of COVID-19, among others, are outside of our control. There have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves, which, if successful, could limit our ability to access capital markets. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Technology Risks​New technologies may cause our drilling methods and equipment to become less competitive and it may become necessary to incur higher levels of operating and capital expenditures in order to keep pace with the disruptive trends in the drilling industry. Growth through the building of new drilling rigs and improvement of existing rigs is not assured.​The market for our services is characterized by continual technological developments that have resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, substantial improvements in the functionality and performance of rigs and equipment. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs and related equipment. Accordingly, we may have to allocate a higher proportion of our capital expenditures to maintain and improve existing rigs and other equipment, purchase and construct newer, higher specification drilling rigs and other equipment to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, and develop new and improved technology and data analytics. 17Table of Contents​Although we take measures to ensure that we develop and use advanced oil and natural gas drilling technology, changes in technology or improvements by competitors could make our equipment less competitive. There can be no assurance that we will:​●have sufficient capital resources to improve existing rigs or build new, technologically advanced drilling rigs;​●avoid cost overruns inherent in large fabrication projects resulting from numerous factors such as shortages or unscheduled delays in delivery of equipment or materials, inadequate levels of skilled labor, unanticipated increases in costs of equipment, materials and labor, design and engineering problems, and financial or other difficulties;​●successfully deploy idle, stacked, new or upgraded drilling rigs;​●effectively manage the size or growth of our organization and drilling fleet;​●maintain crews necessary to operate existing or additional drilling rigs; or​●successfully improve our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects as a result of improving existing drilling rigs or building new drilling rigs.​In the event that we are successful in developing new technologies for use in our business, there is no guarantee of future demand for those technologies. Customers may be reluctant or unwilling to adopt our new technologies. We may also have difficulty negotiating satisfactory terms for our technology services or may be unable to secure prices sufficient to obtain expected returns on our investment in the research and development of new technologies.​Development of new technology is critical to maintaining our competitiveness.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop technology that our customers demand. If we are not successful keeping pace with technological advances and trends (including trends in favor of emissions reducing technologies) or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-effective manner suitable to their needs, demand for our services could decline and we could lose market share. Furthermore, if our equipment or proprietary technologies become obsolete, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, or one or more technologies that we may implement in the future may not work as we expect and our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation could be adversely affected as a result. Additionally, new technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could reduce our competitiveness and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Limitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.​There can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate. Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets. Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected. Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate. Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Technology disputes could negatively impact our operations or increase our costs.​Our services and products use proprietary technology and equipment, which can involve potential infringement of a third party’s rights, or a third party’s infringement of our rights, including patent rights. The majority of the intellectual property rights relating to our drilling rigs and related services are owned by us or certain of our supplying vendors. However, in the event that we or one of our customers or supplying vendors becomes involved in a dispute over infringement of intellectual property rights relating to equipment or technology owned or used by us, services performed 18Table of Contentsby us or products provided by us, we may lose access to important equipment or technology or our ability to provide services or products, or we could be required to cease use of some equipment or technology or be forced to invest or develop replacement technologies to enhance our equipment, technology, services or products. We could also be required to pay license fees or royalties for the use of equipment or technology or provision of services or products. In addition, we may lose a competitive advantage in the event we are unsuccessful in enforcing our rights against third parties. Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business. Technology disputes involving us or our customers or supplying vendors could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.​Improvements in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.​Since our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, any improvement in or new discoveries of alternative energy technologies that increase the use of alternative forms of energy and reduce the demand for oil and natural gas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Legal and Regulatory Risks ​Changes to United States tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.​There have been ongoing discussions and commentary regarding potential significant changes to the United States trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China. In 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the “USTR”) enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China. In September 2018, the USTR enacted another tariff on the import of other Chinese products with an additional combined import value of approximately $200 billion. The tariff became effective on September 24, 2018, with an initial rate of 10%, with the potential for significant increases if the U.S. and China do not reach a new trade deal in the near term. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties, taxes, government regulations and tariffs that would be applicable. It is unclear what changes might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries. Significant tariffs or other restrictions placed on Chinese imports and any related counter-measures that are taken by China could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Even in the absence of further tariffs, the related uncertainty and the market's fear of an escalating trade war might create forecasting difficulties for us and cause our customers and business partners to place fewer orders for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy around the world. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China and the United States and relative uncertainty with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies, a trade war, further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies, or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations.​The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.​As of December 31, 2020, the Company reported consolidated federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $670.3 million and certain other favorable federal income tax attributes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards and certain other attributes may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). An ownership change generally occurs if there is a more than 50 percentage point increase in the aggregate equity ownership of the Company by one or more “5 percent shareholders” (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 19Table of Contentsand 383 of the Code) in any testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change, measured against their lowest percentage ownership at any time during such period.​There is no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of future actions that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards and potentially certain other tax attributes. Potential future transactions involving the sale, issuance, redemption or other disposition of common or preferred shares or other equity-based securities, the exercise of conversion or exchange options under the terms of any convertible or exchangeable debt, the repurchase of any such debt with Company shares, in each case, by a person owning, or treated as owning, 5% or more of the Company’s shares, or a combination of such transactions, may cause or increase the possibility that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382. Under Section 382, an ownership change would subject the Company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs (and possibly certain other tax attributes) that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. If a Section 382 limitation applies, the limitation could cause the Company’s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the Company’s NOL carryforwards to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. The Company’s NOL carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full.​Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. ​Drilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those regulating the transport, storage, use, treatment, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes and materials. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. ​In addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances, and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks. ​The expansion of the scope of laws or regulations protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has promulgated final rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In June 2016, the EPA published final standards to reduce methane emissions for certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas industry and established NSPS Subpart OOOOa that set new standards and required certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and VOC emissions (the “2016 New Source Rule”). In August 2020, the EPA finalized a rule that rolled back the 2016 New Source Rule, which was subsequently stayed temporarily by the D.C. Circuit Court.  The Biden administration has indicated that it would likely repeal the August 2020 rule on methane emissions and evaluate a new regulatory approach going forward. Accordingly, the future status of methane emissions standards is unclear.​Changes in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, drilling fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas, 20Table of Contentsif properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, in response to a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 alleging that the EPA failed to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and several environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a Consent Decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Based on its review required by the Consent Decree, in April 2019, the EPA made a final determination that revision of the RCRA regulations was unnecessary. Any future reclassification of oil and gas wastes as RCRA hazardous waste could result in more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations and financial position. ​The EPA has issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. In November 2016, the BLM issued a rule requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands (the “Waste Prevention Rule”). Although the BLM issued a rule in September 2018 that rescinded critical portions of the Waste Prevention Rule, the 2018 rule was vacated by order of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California in July 2020. Subsequently, in October 2020, the Waste Prevention Rule was largely vacated by the U.S. District Court for the State of Wyoming.  In addition, several states may seek to regulate methane emissions by state law. The Biden administration has indicated that it intends to craft a new rule for regulating methane waste management. Since any such rule will likely be challenged, there is a considerable amount of uncertainty in this area of environmental regulation. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations.​The physical effects of climate change and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.​The physical and regulatory effects of climate change could have a negative impact on our operations, our customers’ operations and the overall demand for our customers' products and services. Scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as “greenhouse gases” (“GHGs”) and including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, is attracting increasing attention worldwide.​We are aware of the increasing focus of local, state, regional, national and international regulatory bodies on GHG emissions and climate change issues. There has been a wide-ranging policy debate, both in the United States and internationally, regarding the impact of GHG emissions and possible means for their regulation. Some of the proposals would require industries to meet stringent standards that would require substantial reductions in GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress and such legislation may be proposed or adopted in the future.​The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeastern United States, which establishes greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs.  In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, which could lead to further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. ​In December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (the “UNFCCC”) in Paris, France in creating an agreement (the “Paris Agreement”) that requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined GHG contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The agreement entered into full force in November 2016. Although the prior administration formally withdrew the United States from the Paris Agreement effective November 4, 2020, the new Administration issued an executive order to rejoin the Paris climate agreement on January 20, 2021. It will take 30 days for the United States to officially rejoin.​21Table of ContentsThe aim of the Paris Agreement is to hold the increase in the average global temperature to well below 2ºC (3.6ºF) above pre-industrial levels with efforts to limit the rise to 1.5ºC (2.7ºF) to protect against the more severe consequences of climate forecasted by scientific studies. These consequences include increased coastal flooding, droughts and associated wildfires, heavy precipitation events, stresses on water supply and agriculture, increased poverty, and negative impacts on health. In connection with the decision to adopt the Paris Agreement, the UNFCCC invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the “IPCC”) to prepare a special report focused on the impacts of an increase in the average global temperature of 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels and related GHG emission pathways. The 2018 IPCC Report concludes that the measures set forth in the Paris Agreement are insufficient and that more aggressive targets and measures will be needed. The 2018 IPCC Report indicates that GHGs must be reduced from 2010 levels by 45 percent by 2030 and 100 percent by 2050 to prevent global warming of 1.5ºC above pre-industrial levels.​It is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effect of climate change or whether additional GHG legislation, regulations or other measures will be adopted at the federal, state or local levels. However, more aggressive efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely and any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs, additional operating restrictions or affect the demand for our customers' products and, accordingly, our services. For example, the California governor issued an executive order on September 23, 2020 ordering actions to pursue GHG emissions reductions, including a direction to the California State Air Resources Board to develop and propose regulations to require increasing volumes of new zero-emission passenger vehicles and trucks sold in California over time, with a targeted ban of the sale of new gasoline vehicles by 2035. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, to the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of or access to capital. Climate change and GHG regulation could also negatively impact the drilling programs of our customers and, consequently, delay, limit or reduce the services we provide. An increased focus by the public on the reduction of GHG emissions as well as the results of the physical impacts of climate change could affect the demand for our customers’ products and have a negative effect on our business.​The cost of complying with any new law, regulation or treaty will depend on the details of the particular program. We will continue to monitor and assess any new policies, legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact of GHG emissions and climate change on our operations and take appropriate actions, where necessary. Any direct and indirect costs of meeting these requirements may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Because our business depends on the level of activity in the oil and natural gas industry, existing or future laws or regulations related to GHGs and climate change, including incentives to conserve energy or use alternative energy sources, could have a negative impact on our business if such laws or regulations reduce demand for oil and natural gas.  In addition to the regulatory efforts described above, there have also been efforts in recent years aimed at the investment community, including investment advisors, sovereign wealth funds, public pension funds, universities and other groups, promoting the divestment of fossil fuel equities as well as to pressure lenders and other financial services companies to limit or curtail activities with companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. If these efforts are successful, our ability and the ability of our customers to access capital markets may be limited and our stock price may be negatively impacted.  Members of the investment community have recently increased their focus on sustainability practices with regard to the oil and gas industry, including practices related to GHGs and climate change. An increasing percentage of the investment community considers sustainability factors in making investment decisions, and an increasing number of our customers consider sustainability factors in awarding work. These developments, and public perception relating to climate change, may curtail production and demand for hydrocarbons such as oil and natural gas by shifting demand towards and investment in relatively lower carbon energy sources such as wind, solar and other renewables.  The renewable energy industry is developing enhanced technologies and becoming more competitive with fossil-fuel energy. If renewable energy becomes more competitive than fossil-fuel energy, particularly during periods of higher oil and natural gas prices, it could have a material effect on our results of operations. If we are unable to successfully continue our sustainability enhancement efforts, we may lose customers, our stock price may be negatively impacted, our reputation may be negatively affected, and it may be more difficult for us to effectively compete.​22Table of ContentsBeyond financial and regulatory impacts, the projected severe effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect our facilities and operations and those of our customers. ​Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.​We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See ‘‘Item 3—Legal Proceedings’’ for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings.​Share Capital and Corporate Structure Risks​Significant issuances of common shares could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.​As of February 19, 2021, we had 32,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 8,449,591 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, including 1,090,003 million held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 387,640 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans and 741,934 common shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding mandatory convertible preferred shares. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of Exchangeable Notes or the conversion of mandatory convertible preferred shares for common shares, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.​Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.​The trading price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:​●variations in quarterly operating results;​●deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance; ​●variability in our revenues;​●our announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; ​●general conditions in and market perceptions of the oil and gas industry; ​●uncertainty about current global economic conditions; ​●fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and ​●other general economic conditions. ​The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.​During 2020, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $166.50 per common share to a low of $10.50 per common share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 23Table of Contentsthat have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our common shares in the future.​Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.​Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:​●Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;​●Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;​●Adopting a shareholder rights plan that limits the number of our common shares a potential acquiror can purchase without either securing the approval of our Board or having their voting interest severely diluted; the plan is sscheduled to expire in April 2021 unless it is extended;​●Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;​●Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and​●Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.​Certain actions taken by us could make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. For instance, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board and in 2017 we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates recommended by shareholders. Conversely, the provisions designed to prevent hostile takeovers, or protect holders of our debt instruments and our joint venture partner, may deter transactions in which shareholders would receive a change of control premium. For example, certain change of control transactions could accelerate the principal amounts outstanding, and require premiums payments, under our debt instruments, or trigger a call option to purchase our interest in SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco.​As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to Nabors in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments to Nabors. Nabors’ debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, may be restricted by the laws of the applicable subsidiaries’ jurisdictions of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources.​​​​24Table of Contents​General  Risks​Our business, results of operations and financial condition have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by global public health epidemics, including the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, and future adverse impacts could be material and difficult to predict.​The global spread of the strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19 and its variants, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, has adversely impacted our operations and the operations of our customers.  The outbreak triggered a sharp sell-off in energy commodities markets during the first quarter of 2020, as economic activity tumbled as a result of government impositions of mandatory closures, quarantines and other restrictions on, or advisories with respect to, travel, business operations and public gatherings or interactions. Certain jurisdictions recently have begun re-opening only to return to restrictions in the face of increases in new COVID-19 cases, while other jurisdictions are continuing to re-open or have nearly completed the re-opening process despite increases in COVID-19 cases. The pandemic may significantly worsen during the upcoming months, which may cause governmental authorities to reconsider restrictions on business, travel, and other activities. ​The significant weakness in oil and natural gas prices resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in sharp reductions in the exploration and production capital and operating budgets of our customers.  Demand for our services and associated product offerings, and the rates we are able to charge to customers, is closely tied to such exploration and production activities and the significant price weakness and associated volatility surrounding these events has had, and is likely to continue to have, an adverse impact on the demand for our services.​Future increases in commodity prices may not necessarily translate into the resumption of exploration and production activities (and a corresponding demand for our services) because our customers’ expectations of future prices may also influence or limit their activity.  As a result of these factors, lower demand for drilling and drilling related  services may persist for a significant time, which would continue to materially adversely affect the rates that we are able to charge our customers and the demand for our services.​The spread of the virus into our workforce may also prevent us from meeting the demands of our customers in the future. For example, if the COVID-19 pandemic were to significantly impact a location where we have a high concentration of business and resources, our local workforce could be affected by the outbreak, which could significantly disrupt our operations or lead to a shutdown of operations in the impacted location.​Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.​Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, and complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:​●theft or misappropriation of funds;​●loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary, confidential or personally identifiable information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);​●disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;​●damage to our reputation with our customers and the market;​●the perception of our products or services as having security vulnerabilities​●exposure to litigation and legal and regulatory costs;​●loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and​25Table of Contents●increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.​Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time. ​We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.​The successful execution of our business strategies depends, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.​Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and other factors, including the impact of COVID-19, are also considered by the rating agencies. Our senior unsecured debt has a non-investment grade rating. Further ratings downgrades may impact our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Changes in the method of determining LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.​Amounts drawn under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. The date has since been extended, with the ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, together with the United States Federal Reserve and the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, announcing plans to consult on ceasing publication of U.S. dollar LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for only the one week and two month U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors. The United States Federal Reserve concurrently issued a statement advising banks to stop new US dollar LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021.It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist and a generally accepted market replacement is not available, we may need to renegotiate the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and may not able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​26Table of ContentsWe may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.​We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized.​The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”) adopted sweeping changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and numerous other changes, the law imposes more stringent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense and net operating losses, and imposes a type of minimum tax designed to reduce the benefits derived from intercompany transactions and payments that result in base erosion. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. Although the Tax Reform Act has not had a material impact on our financial statements to date, if these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions.​Our international operations expose us to compliance obligations and risks under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-corruption laws, and violations of these laws could have a negative impact on our business.​A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to compliance obligations and risks arising under complex foreign and U.S. regulations, which are inherent in engaging in cross-border business and impact our operations in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‘‘FCPA’’) and other similar anti-corruption laws, such as the Bermuda Bribery Act (2016), which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs designed to promote and achieve compliance, we cannot ensure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from risks associated with unlawful acts carried out by our employees or agents. Violations of these laws may result in significant criminal or civil penalties. The occurrence or allegation of violations may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​"
6,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2020-02-25,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS​In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.​Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.​Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability.​Our operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile over the past few years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Declines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and 10Table of ContentsOPEC+, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general economic conditions, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, decisions by more expensive production sources to continue producing oil and gas despite excess supply, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas.​Lower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Additionally, these circumstances could indicate that the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets may exceed their fair value, which could result in a future goodwill impairment. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.​Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy.​Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or vendors will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices remain at the current relatively low levels or decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse impact on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the world wide economy, undercapacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate again in the future due to one or more factors.​We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations.​The oilfield services industry is very competitive with a significant amount of excess capacity, especially in low oil price environments. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, in recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features has become an important factor in determining job awards. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, which requires continued technological developments and increased capital expenditures. Our ability to continually provide technologically competitive drilling-related equipment and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements for equipment. New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could adversely impact our ability to compete. Another key factor in job award determinations is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.​Our ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers’ future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing 11Table of Contentsdayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including environmental and weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations.​Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling and workover industries, including environmental pollution, blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including pollution of coastal waters, damage to wildlife and natural habitats, capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events.​Accidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the impact of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity.​Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.​Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances such as, but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. The downturn in the oil price environment resulted in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, resulting in renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be impacted by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.​12Table of ContentsWe may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle drilling rigs and other assets.​In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized impairment charges of $290.5 million, $124.9 million and $6.9 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet.​The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​In 2019, 2018 and 2017, we received approximately 41%, 41% and 45%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 22%, 24% and 29% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market and may cause our counterparties to seek modifications to our contracts with them.​The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.​We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in the Middle East, South America, the Far East, North Africa and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, political or economic instability, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. ​For example, we are exposed to risks related to political instability in Venezuela. On January 28, 2019, the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (“PdVSA”)  as a Specially Designated National under Executive Order 13850 (the “Order”). The Order prohibited, among other things, business dealings with PdVSA or any entity in which PdVSA owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. Currently, Nabors operates one rig in Venezuela, under contracts with Chevron and a joint venture that is majority-owned by PdVSA, Petropiar. The political uncertainty and civil unrest in Venezuela could have a significant impact on our operations there, including the risk that one or more of our rigs could be nationalized by the government or that we will not be paid for our services. Nabors continues to evaluate the potential impact of these developments on its business and operations in Venezuela.​To the extent that any of these risks arising from our operations in global markets are realized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments.​The 2012 Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a net funded debt to capital ratio of 0.60:1 or less. The net funded debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by net capital. For purposes of the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility, net funded debt is total debt minus the sum of cash and cash equivalents (other than restricted cash). Net capital is the sum of net funded debt plus shareholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2019, our net funded debt to capital ratio was approximately 0.59:1.​13Table of ContentsThe 2018 Revolving Credit Facility requires us to maintain a net leverage ratio 5.50:1 or less and an asset to debt coverage ratio of at least 2.50:1, as of the end of each calendar quarter. As of December 31, 2019, the net leverage ratio was 3.55:1 and the asset to debt coverage ratio was 4.28:1. The net leverage ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by EBITDA (as defined in the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility) of Nabors and its subsidiaries for the latest four consecutive fiscal quarters for which financial statements are required to have been delivered pursuant to the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility. The asset to debt coverage ratio is calculated by dividing (x) drilling-related fixed assets wholly owned by certain of Nabors’ subsidiaries that are guaranteeing the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility (the ‘‘2018 Revolver Guarantors’’) or wholly owned subsidiaries of the 2018 Revolver Guarantors by (y) the commitments under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and certain other indebtedness up to $100 million. The asset to debt coverage ratio applies only during the period which Nabors Delaware fails to maintain an investment grade rating from at least two rating agencies, which was the case as of the date of this report.​The net funded debt to capital ratio, the net leverage ratio and the asset to debt coverage ratio are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.  The net funded debt to capital ratio is a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital. ​As of December 31, 2019, our consolidated total outstanding indebtedness was $3.3 billion. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries’ operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, any of which could negatively impact our stock price or financial condition.​Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.​From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited or adversely affected by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, interest rates and the health or market perceptions of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and oil and gas industry, are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations.​A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.​Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and others also are considered by the rating agencies. Our senior unsecured debt has a non-investment grade rating. Further ratings downgrades may impact our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​Changes in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt.​Amounts drawn under the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist and a generally accepted market replacement is not available, we may need to renegotiate the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility or the 2018 14Table of ContentsRevolving Credit Facility and may not able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility or the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.​We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.​We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized.​The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (“Tax Reform Act”) (H.R. 1), adopted sweeping changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and numerous other changes, the new law imposes more stringent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, the deductibility of net operating losses and imposes a type of minimum tax designed to reduce the benefits derived from intercompany transactions and payments that result in base erosion. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. Although the Tax Reform Act has not had a material impact on our financial statements to date, if these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions.​The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels.​As of December 31, 2019, the Company reported consolidated federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $418.3 million and certain other favorable federal income tax attributes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards and certain other attributes may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). An ownership change generally occurs if there is a more than 50 percentage point increase in the aggregate equity ownership of the Company by one or more “5 percent shareholders” (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change, measured against their lowest percentage ownership at any time during such period.​There is no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of future actions that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards and potentially certain other tax attributes. Potential future transactions involving the sale, issuance, redemption or other disposition of common or preferred shares, the exercise of conversion or exchange options under the terms of any convertible or exchangeable debt, the repurchase of any such debt with Company shares, in each case, by a person owning, or treated as owning, 5% or more of the Company’s shares, or a combination of such transactions, may cause or increase the possibility that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382. Under Section 382, an ownership change would subject the Company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs (and possibly certain other tax attributes) that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. If a Section 382 limitation applies, the limitation could cause the Company’s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the Company’s NOL carryforwards to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. The Company’s NOL carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full.​15Table of ContentsChanges to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.​Drilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those regulating the transport, storage, use, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes and materials. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. ​In addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances, and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks. ​The expansion of the scope of laws or regulations protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (‘‘EPA’’) has promulgated final rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In June 2016, the EPA published final standards to reduce methane emissions for certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas industry but, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule that would stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and reconsider the entirety of the June 2016 standards.  The requirements of the June 2016 standards currently remain in effect, pending the EPA taking final action on its proposed two-year stay, which will likely be promptly challenged. In October 2018, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would reconsider limits on methane emissions set by the June 2016 standards and reduce inspection and repair requirements.  ​Changes in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (‘‘RCRA’’) and instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a Consent Decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the Consent Decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any reclassification of such wastes as RCRA hazardous wastes could result in more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. ​Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, and other climate changes. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeastern United States, which establishes greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Some international initiatives have been or may be adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions. In December 2015, the United Nations 16Table of ContentsFramework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France finalized an agreement, referred to as the “Paris Agreement’, requiring member countries to review and ‘‘represent a progression’’ in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020, including pledges to voluntarily limit or make future greenhouse gas emissions. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in 2016 but formally withdrew in August 2017. The withdrawal will take effect in November 2020. Several U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state level despite the federal withdrawal.​In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, which could lead to further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. Although in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (‘‘BLM’’) issued a rule requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands, the BLM  rescinded the rule in September 2018. Several states have sued the BLM seeking to restore the November 2016 rule, and other states may regulate methane emissions by state law. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations.​We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.​Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue to us, as well as an increase in operating costs.​Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively impacted by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.​A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‘‘FCPA’’) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs meant to ensure compliance, we cannot be sure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from violations of these laws. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​17Table of ContentsProvisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium.​Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:​●Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;​●Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;​●Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;​●Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and​●Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.​Certain actions taken by us could make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. For instance, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board, we did not renew our shareholder rights plan when it expired in July 2016, and in 2017 we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates recommended by shareholders. Conversely, the provisions designed to prevent hostile takeovers, or protect holders of our debt instruments and our joint venture partner, may deter transactions in which shareholders would receive a change of control premium. For example, certain change of control transactions could accelerate the principal amounts outstanding, and require premiums payments, under our debt instruments, or trigger a call option to purchase our interest in SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco.​Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations.​We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions, including claims related to our acquisition of Tesco. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See ‘‘Item 3—Legal Proceedings’’ for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings.​Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks.​Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, and complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:​●theft or misappropriation of funds;​●loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary, confidential or personally identifiable information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);​●disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;​18Table of Contents●damage to our reputation with our customers and the market;​●exposure to litigation;​●loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and​●increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events.​Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time. ​We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Changes to United States tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business.​There have been ongoing discussions and commentary regarding potential significant changes to the United States trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China. In 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the “USTR”) enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China. In September 2018, the USTR enacted another tariff on the import of other Chinese products with an additional combined import value of approximately $200 billion. The tariff became effective on September 24, 2018, with an initial rate of 10%, with the potential for significant increases if the U.S. and China do not reach a new trade deal in the near term. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties, taxes, government regulations and tariffs that would be applicable. It is unclear what changes might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries. Significant tariffs or other restrictions placed on Chinese imports and any related counter-measures that are taken by China could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Even in the absence of further tariffs, the related uncertainty and the market's fear of an escalating trade war might create forecasting difficulties for us and cause our customers and business partners to place fewer orders for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy around the world. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China and the United States and relative uncertainty with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies, a trade war, further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies, or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations.​Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position.​We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commenced operations in December, 2017. The success of the Saudi joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner’s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling units and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner.​We also completed the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017. We are still attempting to obtain certain regulatory approvals related to the Tesco acquisition, and may not be able to do so in certain jurisdictions. ​19Table of ContentsThe anticipated benefits of the Saudi joint venture, the Tesco acquisition, and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees, or the disposition of certain assets or operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.​The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success.​The successful execution of our business strategies depends, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.​Significant issuances of common shares or exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares.​As of February 19, 2020, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 419,928,615 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, including 52,800,203 million held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 6,631,194 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans, 31,997,773 common shares were reserved for issuance upon exchange of outstanding Exchangeable Notes, and 37,096,700 common shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding mandatory convertible preferred shares. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of Exchangeable Notes or the conversion of mandatory convertible preferred shares for common shares, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.​Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile.​The trading price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:​●variations in quarterly operating results;​●deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance; ​●variability in our revenues;​●our announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; ​●general conditions in and market perceptions of the oil and gas industry; ​●uncertainty about current global economic conditions; ​●fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and ​●other general economic conditions. ​The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable 20Table of Contentsrelative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline.​During 2019, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $4.08 per common share to a low of $1.50 per common share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our common shares in the future.​As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations.​We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to Nabors in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments to Nabors. Nabors’ debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, may be restricted by the laws of the applicable subsidiaries’ jurisdictions of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources.​"
12,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2019-02-28,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Our operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, have been highly volatile over the past few years and are expected to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. For example, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel during 2014 and reached a near ten-year low of $26 per barrel in February 2016. Oil prices began to stabilize during 2017 and steadily increased throughout much of 2018, hitting a four-year high of $76 per barrel in September. However, during the fourth quarter of 2018, oil prices declined dramatically to a low of $42 per barrel. Declines in oil prices are primarily caused by, among other things, an excess of supply of crude oil in relation to demand. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (“OPEC”) and OPEC+, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general economic conditions, oil and gas production levels by non-OPEC countries, decisions by more expensive production sources to continue producing oil and gas despite excess supply, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Additionally, these circumstances could indicate that the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets may exceed their fair value, which could result in a future goodwill impairment. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries. Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by low oil prices and/or turmoil in the global economy. Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or vendors will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices remain at the current relatively low levels or decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse impact on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience  10 Table of Contentsdifficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the world wide economy, undercapacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate again in the future due to one or more factors. We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The oilfield services industry is very competitive with a significant amount of excess capacity, especially in low oil price environments. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, in recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features has become an important factor in determining job awards. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, which requires continued technological developments and increased capital expenditures. Our ability to continually provide technologically competitive drilling-related equipment and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements for equipment. New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could adversely impact our ability to compete. Another key factor in job award determinations is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive. Our ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers’ future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing dayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss, including environmental and weather-related risks, that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling and workover industries, including environmental pollution, blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including pollution of coastal waters, damage to wildlife and natural habitats, capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events. Accidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may  11 Table of Contentschoose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the impact of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity. Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment. Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances such as, but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. The downturn in the oil price environment resulted in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, resulting in renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be impacted by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle rigs. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized impairment charges of $46.1 million, $6.9 million and $245.2 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet. The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we received approximately 41%, 45% and 46%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 24%, 29% and 33% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market and may cause our counterparties to seek modifications to our contracts with them.  12 Table of ContentsThe profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls. We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in the Middle East, South America, the Far East, North Africa and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, political or economic instability, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain.  For example, we are exposed to risks related to political instability in Venezuela. On January 28, 2019, the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control designated Petroleos de Venezuela S.A. (“PdVSA”)  as a Specially Designated National under Executive Order 13850 (the “Order”). The Order prohibited, among other things, business dealings with PdVSA or any entity in which PdVSA owns, directly or indirectly, a 50 percent or greater interest. As of December 31, 2018, Nabors operated four rigs in Venezuela, under contracts with Chevron and two joint ventures that are majority-owned by PdVSA, Petroboscán and Petrocedeño. The political uncertainty and civil unrest in Venezuela could have a significant impact on our operations there, including the risk that one or more of our rigs could be nationalized by the government or that we will not be paid for our services. Nabors continues to evaluate the potential impact of these developments on its business and operations in Venezuela. To the extent that any of these risks arising from our operations in global markets are realized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments. As of December 31, 2018, we had approximately $3.6 billion in outstanding debt, resulting in a gross debt to capital ratio of 0.57:1, a net debt to capital ratio of 0.53:1 and an asset to debt coverage ratio of approximately 3.82:1. Availability under both the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a covenant not to exceed a net debt to capital ratio of 0.60:1. In addition, availability under the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility is subject to a covenant to maintain an asset to debt coverage ratio of at least 2.50:1. The gross debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing total debt by total capitalization (total debt plus shareholders’ equity). The net debt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing net debt (total debt minus the sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments) by net capitalization (net debt plus shareholders’ equity).  The asset to debt coverage ratio is calculated by dividing (x) drilling-related fixed assets wholly owned by the 2018 Revolver Guarantors or wholly owned subsidiaries of the 2018 Revolver Guarantors by (y) total debt of the 2018 Revolver Guarantors (subject to certain exclusions).  The asset to debt coverage ratio applies only during any period which Nabors Delaware fails to maintain an investment grade rating from at least two ratings agencies. The gross debt to capital ratio, the net debt to capital ratio and the asset to debt coverage ratio are not measures of operating performance or liquidity defined by U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies.  The gross debt to capital ratio and the net debt to capital ratio are methods for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to its capital.  As of December 31, 2018, we would have been able to borrow $1.267 billion in aggregate under our 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and an additional $496.25 million in aggregate under our 2012 Revolving Credit Facility, in each case subject to compliance with the conditions and covenants contained therein, including compliance with applicable financial ratios. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries’ operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facilities and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes, any of which could negatively impact our stock price or financial condition. 13 Table of Contents Our ability to access capital markets could be limited. From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited or adversely affected by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, interest rates and the health of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and oil and gas industry, are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations. A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources. Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and others also are considered by the rating agencies. The major U.S. credit rating agencies have downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to non-investment grade. These and further ratings downgrades may impact our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Changes in the method of determining London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest expense related to outstanding debt. Amounts drawn under the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility bear interest rates in relation to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark by the end of 2021. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The U.S. Federal Reserve is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a newly created index called the Broad Treasury Financing Rate, calculated with a broad set of short-term repurchase agreements backed by treasury securities. If LIBOR ceases to exist and a generally accepted market replacement is not available, we may need to renegotiate the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility or the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility and may not able to do so with terms that are favorable to us. The overall financial markets may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market or the inability to renegotiate the 2012 Revolving Credit Facility or the 2018 Revolving Credit Facility with favorable terms could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities. We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized. Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (‘‘OECD’’) published a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan in July 2013, seeking to reform the taxation of multinational companies. The recommendations made by the OECD may result in unilateral, uncoordinated changes in tax laws in the countries in which we operate or are organized, which may result in double taxation or otherwise increase our tax liabilities which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (H.R. 1), adopted sweeping changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and numerous other changes, the new law imposes more stringent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, the deductibility of net operating losses and imposes a type of minimum tax designed to reduce the benefits derived from intercompany transactions and payments that result in base erosion. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. Although the Tax Reform Act has not had a material impact on our 2018 financial statements, if these tax laws, treaties  14 Table of Contentsor regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions. The Company’s ability to use its net operating loss carryforwards, and possibly other tax attributes, to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be significantly limited due to various circumstances, including future transactions involving the sale or issuance of Company equity securities, or if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels. As of December 31, 2018, the Company reported consolidated federal net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards of approximately $578.0 million and certain other favorable federal income tax attributes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards and certain other attributes may be limited if it experiences an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (“Section 382”) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). An ownership change generally occurs if there is a more than 50 percentage point increase in the aggregate equity ownership of the Company by one or more “5 percent shareholders” (as that term is defined for purposes of Sections 382 and 383 of the Code) in any testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding any potential ownership change, measured against their lowest percentage ownership at any time during such period. There is no assurance that the Company will not experience an ownership change under Section 382 as a result of future actions that may significantly limit or possibly eliminate its ability to use its NOL carryforwards and potentially certain other tax attributes. Potential future transactions involving the sale, issuance, redemption or other disposition of common or preferred shares, the exercise of conversion or exchange options under the terms of any convertible or exchangeable debt, the repurchase of any such debt with Company shares, in each case, by a person owning, or treated as owning, 5% or more of the Company’s shares, or a combination of such transactions, may cause or increase the possibility that the Company will experience an ownership change under Section 382. Under Section 382, an ownership change would subject the Company to an annual limitation that applies to the amount of pre-ownership change NOLs (and possibly certain other tax attributes) that may be used to offset post-ownership change taxable income. If a Section 382 limitation applies, the limitation could cause the Company’s U.S. federal income taxes to be greater, or to be paid earlier, than they otherwise would be, and could cause all or a portion of the Company’s NOL carryforwards to expire unused. Similar rules and limitations may apply for state income tax purposes. The Company’s ability to use its NOL carryforwards will also depend on the amount of taxable income it generates in future periods. The Company’s NOL carryforwards may expire before it can generate sufficient taxable income to use them in full. Changes to or noncompliance with laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Drilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those regulating the transport, storage, use, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes and materials. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. In addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances, and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks.  15 Table of Contents The expansion of the scope of laws or regulations protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (‘‘EPA’’) has promulgated final rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In June 2016, the EPA published final standards to reduce methane emissions for certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas industry but, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule that would stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and reconsider the entirety of the June 2016 standards.  The requirements of the June 2016 standards currently remain in effect, pending the EPA taking final action on its proposed two-year stay, which will likely be promptly challenged. In October 2018, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would reconsider limits on methane emissions set by the June 2016 standards and reduce inspection and repair requirements.   Changes in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (‘‘RCRA’’) and instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a Consent Decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the Consent Decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any reclassification of such wastes as RCRA hazardous wastes could result in more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, and other climate changes. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeastern United States, which establishes greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Some international initiatives have been or may be adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions. In December 2015, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France finalized an agreement, referred to as the “Paris Agreement’, requiring member countries to review and ‘‘represent a progression’’ in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020, including pledges to voluntarily limit or make future greenhouse gas emissions. The United States signed the Paris Agreement in 2016 but formally withdrew in August 2017. The withdrawal will take effect in November 2020. Several U.S. states formed the United States Climate Alliance to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state level despite the federal withdrawal. In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, which could lead to further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. Although in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (‘‘BLM’’) issued a rule requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands, the BLM  rescinded the rule in September 2018. Several states have sued the BLM seeking to restore the November 2016 rule, and other states may regulate methane emissions by state law. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations.  16 Table of ContentsWe rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction. Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue to us, as well as an increase in operating costs. Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively impacted by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‘‘FCPA’’) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs meant to ensure compliance, we cannot be sure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from violations of these laws. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, these provisions and those in our outstanding debt and Saudi joint venture documents may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium. Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:  ·Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;  ·Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;  ·Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;  ·Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and  ·Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board.  17 Table of ContentsCertain actions taken by us could make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. For instance, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board, we did not renew our shareholder rights plan when it expired in July 2016, and in 2017 we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates recommended by shareholders. Conversely, the provisions designed to prevent hostile takeovers, or protect holders of our debt instruments and our joint venture partner, may deter transactions in which shareholders would receive a change of control premium. For example, certain change of control transactions could accelerate the principal amounts outstanding, and require premiums payments, under our debt instruments, or trigger a call option to purchase our interest in SANAD, our joint venture with Saudi Aramco. Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions, including claims related to our acquisition of Tesco. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See ‘‘Item 3—Legal Proceedings’’ for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings. Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks. Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, and complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:  ·theft or misappropriation of funds;  ·loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary, confidential or personally identifiable information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);  ·disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;  ·damage to our reputation with our customers and the market;  ·exposure to litigation;  ·loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and  ·increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time.  We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyberattacks. Any cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  18 Table of ContentsChanges to United States tax, tariff and import/export regulations may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets and our business. There have been ongoing discussions and commentary regarding potential significant changes to the United States trade policies, treaties, tariffs and taxes, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China. In 2018, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (the “USTR”) enacted tariffs on imports into the U.S. from China. In September 2018, the USTR enacted another tariff on the import of other Chinese products with an additional combined import value of approximately $200 billion. The tariff became effective on September 24, 2018, with an initial rate of 10%, with the potential for significant increases if the U.S. and China do not reach a new trade deal in the near term. There is significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to the trade policies, treaties, taxes, government regulations and tariffs that would be applicable. It is unclear what changes might be considered or implemented and what response to any such changes may be by the governments of other countries. Significant tariffs or other restrictions placed on Chinese imports and any related counter-measures that are taken by China could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Even in the absence of further tariffs, the related uncertainty and the market's fear of an escalating trade war might create forecasting difficulties for us and cause our customers and business partners to place fewer orders for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity and restrict our access to suppliers or customers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy around the world. Given the relatively fluid regulatory environment in China and the United States and relative uncertainty with respect to tariffs, international trade agreements and policies, a trade war, further governmental action related to tariffs or international trade policies, or additional tax or other regulatory changes in the future could directly and adversely impact our financial results and results of operations. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commenced operations in December, 2017. The success of the Saudi joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner’s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling units and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner. We also completed the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017. We are still attempting to obtain certain regulatory approvals related to the Tesco acquisition, and may not be able to do so in certain jurisdictions.  The anticipated benefits of the Saudi joint venture, the Tesco acquisition, and other strategic transactions may not be fully realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees, or the disposition of certain assets or operations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success. The successful execution of our business strategies depends, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement with us. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  19 Table of ContentsSignificant issuances of common shares or exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. As of February 21, 2019, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 411,592,178 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, including 52,800,203 million held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 17,352,792 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans, 31,997,773 common shares were reserved for issuance upon exchange of outstanding Exchangeable Notes , and 37,096,700 common shares were reserved for issuance upon conversion of outstanding mandatory convertible preferred shares. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of Exchangeable Notes or the conversion of mandatory convertible preferred shares for common shares, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Our common share price has been and may continue to be volatile. The trading price of our common shares has fluctuated in the past and is subject to significant fluctuations in response to the following factors, some of which are beyond our control:  ·variations in quarterly operating results;  ·deviations in our earnings from publicly disclosed forward-looking guidance;   ·variability in our revenues;  ·our announcements of significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures;   ·general conditions in the oil and gas industry;   ·uncertainty about current global economic conditions;   ·fluctuations in stock market price and volume; and   ·other general economic conditions.  The trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our markets or our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts and we cannot provide any assurance that analysts will cover us or provide favorable coverage. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price could materially decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our Company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to materially decline. During 2018, our stock price on the NYSE ranged from a high of $8.87 per common share to a low of $1.81 per common share. In recent years, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies in industries similar to ours. Some of these fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. These market fluctuations may decrease the market price of our common shares in the future. As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations. We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to Nabors in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or  20 Table of Contentsprohibit these types of upstream payments to Nabors. Nabors’ debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, may be restricted by the laws of the applicable subsidiaries’ jurisdictions of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources. "
0,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2018-03-01,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Our operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, can be highly volatile. For example, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel during 2014 and were as low as $26 per barrel in February 2016. During 2017, oil prices began to stabilize to moderate levels at an average of approximately $54 per barrel, still well below the peak we experienced three years ago and the average price over the last decade. The decrease in oil prices was caused by, among other things, an oversupply of crude oil and stagnant demand. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general economic conditions, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, availability and pricing of alternative energy sources, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. As a result of the low oil price environment that began at the end of 2014, drilling, exploration and production activity declined in 2015 and remained low throughout 2016, resulting in a corresponding decline in the demand for our drilling services and/or a reduction in our dayrates and rig utilization. Although oil prices rebounded somewhat in 2017, they remain relatively low when compared to prices earlier in the decade and the level of drilling, exploration and production activities remains lower than prior to 2014. The continuation of relatively lower oil and natural gas prices, or a decline in such prices, could have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, liquidity and profitability. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Additionally, these circumstances could indicate that the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets may exceed their fair value, which could result in a future goodwill impairment. Lower oil and natural gas prices also could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.  11 Table of ContentsOur customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by turmoil in the global economy. Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices, we are unable to fully predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or vendors will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices remain at the current relatively low levels or decrease and/or global economic conditions deteriorate, there could be a material adverse impact on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the event of further recovery in oil prices and the world wide economy, undercapacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate again in the future due to one or more factors. We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The oilfield services industry is very competitive. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition. In addition, in recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features has become an important factor in determining job awards. Our customers increasingly demand the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, which requires continued technological developments and increased capital expenditures. Our ability to continually provide technologically competitive drilling-related equipment and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements for equipment. New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could adversely impact our ability to compete. Another key factor in job award determinations is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to increase or even maintain our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive. Our ability to renew existing customer contracts, or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts depends on market conditions and our customers’ future drilling plans, which are subject to change. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing dayrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling and workover industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Global climate change could lengthen these periods of reduced activity, but we cannot currently estimate to what degree. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events.  12 Table of ContentsAccidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future, making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the impact of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity. Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment. Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances such as, but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event, or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customers may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. The downturn in the oil price environment resulted in downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, resulting in renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under the contracts, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be impacted by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms, or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle rigs. In 2017 and 2016, we recognized impairment charges of $6.9 million and $245.2 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet. The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2017 and 2016, we received approximately 45% and 46%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer and partner in our SANAD joint venture, Saudi Aramco, representing 29% and 33% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these periods. The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties it may be unable to make required payments or seek to renegotiate  13 Table of Contentscontracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market. The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls. We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in the Middle East, Canada, South America, Algeria, the Far East, North Africa and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, political or economic instability, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in limits or restrictions in our ability to operate or compete, the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We also are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. To the extent that any of these risks arising from our operations in global markets are realized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $4.0 billion in outstanding debt and the ability to borrow up to $1.7 billion under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, subject to compliance with the conditions and covenants of that facility including the facility’s requirement that our net debt to capital ratio not exceed 0.60:1. As of December 31, 2017, our net debt to capital ratio was 0.56:1. On January 16, 2018, we consummated an offering of $800 million in aggregate principal amount of Nabors Delaware’s 5.75% senior notes due 2025. The proceeds from this offering were used to repay indebtedness of Nabors and its subsidiaries, including all of Nabors Delaware’s outstanding 6.15% senior notes due February 2018. After giving effect to this offering, our total outstanding debt was approximately $4.0 billion. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, firm transportation and processing, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries’ operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Our ability to access capital markets could be limited. From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings, and the health of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and oil and gas industry, are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations. A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources. Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing may be affected by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and others also are considered by the rating agencies. The major U.S. credit rating agencies have downgraded our senior unsecured debt rating to non-investment grade. These and further ratings downgrades may impact our cost of capital and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  14 Table of ContentsWe may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities. We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized. Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (‘‘OECD’’) published a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan in July 2013, seeking to reform the taxation of multinational companies. The recommendations made by the OECD may result in unilateral, uncoordinated changes in tax laws in the countries in which we operate or are organized, which may result in double taxation or otherwise increase our tax liabilities which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (H.R. 1), adopted sweeping changes to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition to lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate and numerous other changes, the new law imposes more stringent limitations on the deductibility of interest expense, the deductibility of net operating losses and imposes a type of minimum tax designed to reduce the benefits derived from intercompany transactions and payments that result in base erosion. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. If these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions. Changes to or noncompliance with governmental laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Drilling of oil and natural gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate, including comprehensive and frequently changing laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment, including those regulating the transport, storage, use, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of, and exposure to, solid and hazardous wastes and materials. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. In addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances, and may impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks. The expansion of the scope of laws or regulations protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (‘‘EPA’’) has promulgated final rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In June 2016, the EPA published final standards to reduce methane emissions for certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas industry but, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule that would stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and reconsider the entirety of the June 2016 standards. On August 10, 2017, the D.C. Circuit rejected a request by the American Petroleum Institute, an intervenor in the case, to reconsider the court’s July 3, 2017 decision to vacate the 90-day stay.  15 Table of ContentsChanges in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (‘‘RCRA’’) and instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, The EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a Consent Decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the Consent Decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any reclassification of such wastes as RCRA hazardous wastes could result in more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, and other climate changes. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States, which establishes greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Some international initiatives have been or may be adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that prepared an agreement requiring member countries to review and ‘‘represent a progression’’ in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Although this international agreement, referred to as the “Paris Agreement’, does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or make future emissions. The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in 2016 but, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the intent of the United States to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, which may lead to further regulations of greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. Furthermore, in November 2016, the Bureau of Land Management (‘‘BLM’’) published a final rule requiring reductions in methane emissions from venting, flaring, and leaking activities on public lands, but the BLM has since published a proposed rulemaking in October 2017 that would temporarily suspend certain requirements contained in the November 2016 final rule until January 17, 2019. Future or more stringent federal or state regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations. We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction. Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue to us, as well as an increase in operating costs. Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers, and service providers could be negatively impacted by changes in industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies  16 Table of Contentsor equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (‘‘FCPA’’) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs meant to ensure compliance, we cannot be sure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from violations of these laws. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, they may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium. Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:  ·Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;  ·Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;  ·Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;  ·Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and  ·Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board. At the request of shareholders, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board. In addition, our shareholder rights plan expired in July 2016, and in 2017 we amended our policy regarding nomination and proxy access for director candidates recommended by shareholders. Each of these changes may make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. The remaining provisions designed to avoid a coercive takeover may not be fully effective so that a party may still be able to acquire the Company without paying what the Board considers to be fair value, including a control premium. Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions, including claims related to our acquisition of Tesco. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See ‘‘Item 3—Legal Proceedings’’ for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings. 17 Table of ContentsOur business is subject to cybersecurity risks. Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, phishing, malware, design defects, human error, or complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:  ·Theft or misappropriation of funds;  ·loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary or confidential information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);  ·disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;  ·damage to our reputation with our customers and the market;  ·exposure to litigation;  ·loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and  ·increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time.  We do not presently maintain insurance coverage to protect against cybersecurity risks. If we procure such coverage in the future, we cannot ensure that it will be sufficient to cover any particular losses we may experience as a result of such cyber attacks. Any cyber incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which commenced operations in December, 2017. The success of the Saudi joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner’s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling units and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner. We also completed the acquisition of Tesco in December 2017. Potential issues and difficulties that may be encountered with the Tesco acquisition include the following:  ·the inability to successfully integrate the respective businesses of Tesco and Nabors in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the combination, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the combination not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;  ·lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;  ·integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and customer service;  18 Table of Contents ·certain regulatory approvals related to the transaction that we are still in the process of obtaining;  ·potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the Tesco transaction; and  ·performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the transaction and integrating the companies’ operations. The anticipated benefits of the Saudi joint venture, the Tesco acquisition, and other strategic transactions may not be realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees and significant transactional expenses, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success. The successful execution of our business strategies will depend, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers and employees. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement with us. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Nabors’ performance could be adversely affected if the company does not identify or retain key employees and skilled workers of Tesco. It is possible that these employees may not remain with the combined company. The loss of the services of one or more of such key employees and skilled workers could adversely affect Nabors’ future operating results because of their experience and knowledge of Tesco’s business. In addition, current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the company as the integration of Tesco’s operations with Nabors’ continues. This may adversely affect the ability of Nabors to attract and retain key personnel, which could adversely affect Nabors’ performance. Significant issuances of common shares or exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares. As of February 22, 2018, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 368,338,349 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, of which 52,800,203 million were held by our subsidiaries. In addition, 10,629,634 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans, and 31,997,773 common shares were reserved for issuance upon exchange of outstanding Exchangeable Notes. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of Exchangeable Notes for common shares, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations. We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs and obligations, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that such operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to Nabors in respect of intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, such operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments to Nabors. Nabors’ debt instruments do not contain covenants prohibiting any such contractual restrictions. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated with such operating subsidiaries paying dividends. Finally, the ability of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us, may be restricted by the laws of the  19 Table of Contentsapplicable subsidiaries’ jurisdiction of organization and other laws and regulations. If subsidiaries are unable to distribute or otherwise make payments to us, we may not be able to pay interest or principal on obligations when due, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds from other sources. "
14,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2017-02-28,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows, profitability and ability to retain skilled employees. Our operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, can be highly volatile. For example, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel during 2014 and were as low as $26.21 per barrel in February 2016. The decrease in oil prices has been caused by, among other things, an oversupply of crude oil and stagnant demand. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, general economic conditions, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. As a result of the sustained low oil price environment beginning at the end of 2014, the level of drilling, exploration and production activity declined in 2015 and remained low throughout 2016, resulting in a corresponding decline in the demand for our drilling services and/or a reduction in our dayrates and rig utilization. The continuation of  10 Table of Contentslower oil and natural gas prices or the further decline in such prices could have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows, liquidity and profitability. A continuation of the lower oil and natural gas price environment could also adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying values of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Additionally, these circumstances could indicate that the carrying amount of our goodwill and intangible assets may exceed their fair value, which could result in a future goodwill impairment. A continuation of lower oil and natural gas prices could also affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries. Our customers and thereby our business and profitability could be adversely affected by turmoil in the global economy.Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the depressed economic environment, we are unable to predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or vendors will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices remain low and/or global economic conditions remain tepid or if either or both further deteriorate in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the case of a recovery in oil prices and the world wide economy, undercapacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate again in the future due to one or more factors. We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations. The oilfield services industry is very competitive. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition, as we have observed over the past two years in certain markets. In addition, in recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features has become an important factor in determining job awards. Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, which requires continued technological developments and increased capital expenditures. Our ability to continually provide technologically competitive drilling-related equipment and services can impact our ability to defend, maintain or increase prices, maintain market share, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers. Our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements for equipment. New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete, which could adversely impact our ability to compete. Another key factor in job award determinations is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. If we are unable to remain competitive based on these and/or other competitive factors, we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We must renew customer contracts to remain competitive.    We had a number of customer contracts that expired in 2016, and have a number that will expire in 2017. Our ability to renew these contracts or obtain new contracts and the terms of any such contracts will depend on market conditions and our customers’ future drilling plans, which are subject to change. For example, during 2015 and 2016, a number of oil and gas companies, including some of our customers, publicly announced significant reductions in their planned exploration and development spending. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we are currently experiencing, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing day  11 Table of Contentsrates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our results of operations. Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling and workover industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events.  Accidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event for which we are not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the impact of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity. Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment.  Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances, such as, but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  During periods of depressed market conditions, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. During 2016, we experienced continued downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, resulting in renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers and early termination of contracts by others. Our customers’ ability to perform their obligations under the contract, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be impacted by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor their indemnification and/or payment obligations, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms — which may prove difficult during a depressed market — or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  12 Table of ContentsWe may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle rigs.  In 2016 and 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $245.2 million and $118.1 million, respectively, related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet. The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In 2016 and 2015, we received approximately 46% and 26%, respectively, of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates), with our largest customer Saudi Aramco representing 33% and 12% of our consolidated operating revenues, respectively, for these years.  The loss of one or more of our larger customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.  In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties they may be unable to make required payments or seek to renegotiate contracts, which could adversely affect our liquidity and profitability. Financial difficulties experienced by customers could also adversely affect our utilization rates in the affected market. The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls.  We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in the Middle East, Canada, South America, Algeria, the Far East, North Africa and Russia. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, labor strikes, political or economic instability, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We are also subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. To the extent that any of these risks arising from our operations in global markets are realized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.6 billion in outstanding debt and no amounts outstanding under our $2.25 billion revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. On January 13, 2017, we consummated an offering of $575 million in aggregate principal amount of Nabors Delaware’s 0.75% exchangeable senior notes due 2024 (the “Exchangeable Notes”).  After giving effect to this offering, our total outstanding debt was approximately $4.0 billion.  We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, firm transportation and processing, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries’ operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Our ability to access capital markets could be limited.  From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets could be limited by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings and the health of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and oil and gas industry, are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that  13 Table of Contentswe will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and results of operations.  A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources.  Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, asset purchases or sales, as well as near-term and long-term growth opportunities and industry conditions. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access capital markets or other financing sources in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations. Nabors and its wholly owned subsidiary, Nabors Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Nabors Delaware”), are holding companies with no significant assets other than the stock of our operating subsidiaries and investment in unconsolidated affiliates. In order to meet our financial needs, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that have been made to operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flows from these operating subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay us dividends or sufficient cash flows to make payments of interest and principal on the intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements or be made subject to laws or regulations that restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. There can also be adverse tax consequences associated with our subsidiaries and equity method investees paying dividends to us. We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities.  We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are organized. Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (“OECD”) published a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan in July 2013, seeking to reform the taxation of multinational companies. The recommendations made by the OECD may result in unilateral, uncoordinated changes in tax laws in the countries in which we operate or are organized, which may result in double taxation or otherwise increase our tax liabilities which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. If these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions. Changes to or noncompliance with governmental laws and regulations or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. Drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our costs to comply with these laws and regulations may be substantial. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has promulgated rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In June 2016, the EPA published final standards to reduce methane emissions for certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and gas industry and, through the issuance of a final Information Collection Request, is seeking additional information from oil and gas producing operators as necessary to expand these standards to include existing equipment and processes. In addition, U.S. federal laws and the laws of other jurisdictions  14 Table of Contentsstrictly regulate the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances, and impose liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills.Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks. Changes in environmental laws and regulations may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, drilling, fluids, produced water and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil or gas, if properly handled, are currently exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (‘‘RCRA’’) and instead, are regulated under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions. However, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the  EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. Any reclassification of such wastes as RCRA hazardous wastes could result in more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere, and other climatic changes. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States and the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative in the western United States, which establish greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Some international initiatives have been or may be adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions. In December 2015, the United States joined the international community of the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that requires member countries to review and “represent a progression” in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set greenhouse gas emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2010. Although this international agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their greenhouse gas emissions, it does include pledges to voluntarily limit or make future emissions. In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, which may lead to further regulations of greenhouse gas emissions under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas sector, including onshore and offshore production activities. Future or more stringent regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies, curtail production and demand for oil and natural gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate, which may in turn adversely affect results of operations. The expansion of the scope of laws or regulations protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. Violation of environmental laws or regulations could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations, capital expenditures, delays in the permitting or performance of projects, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction. Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that  15 Table of Contentswe use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue to us, as well as an increase in operating costs.  Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers and service providers could be negatively impacted by current industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.  The SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. While our employees and agents are required to comply with applicable anti-corruption laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training programs meant to ensure compliance, we cannot be sure that our internal policies, procedures and programs will always protect us from violations of these laws. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, they may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium. Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire.  Provisions in our organizational documents that are meant to help us avoid a coercive takeover include:  ·Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;  ·Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;  ·Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote;  ·Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and  ·Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board. At the request of shareholders, in June 2012 we adopted an amendment to our bye-laws to declassify the Board.  In addition, our shareholder rights plan expired in July 2016.  Each of these changes may make it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. The remaining provisions designed to avoid a coercive takeover may not be fully effective so that a party may still be able to acquire the Company without paying what the Board considers to be fair value, including a control premium.   16 Table of ContentsLegal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Item 3—Legal Proceedings for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings. The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success. The successful execution of our business strategies will depend, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement with us. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position. We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures, investments, joint ventures, alliances and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives.  For example, in October 2016, we announced an agreement to form a new joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, which is expected to commence operations by the second half of 2017. The success of this joint venture depends, to a large degree, on the satisfactory performance of our joint venture partner’s obligations, including contributions of capital, drilling units and related equipment, and our ability to maintain an effective, working relationship with our joint venture partner.    The anticipated benefits of such joint venture and other strategic transactions may not be realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees and significant transactional expenses, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks. Our operations are increasingly dependent on information technologies and services.  Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow, and include, among other things, storms and natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, viruses, malware, design defects, human error, or complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced, or upgraded. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things:  ·loss, corruption, or misappropriation of intellectual property, or other proprietary or confidential information (including customer, supplier, or employee data);   ·disruption or impairment of our and our customers’ business operations and safety procedures;  ·loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems; and   ·increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks and other cyber events are evolving and unpredictable. Moreover, we have no control over the information technology systems of our customers, suppliers, and others with which our systems may connect and communicate. As a result, the occurrence of a cyber incident could go unnoticed for a period time. Any such incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 17 Table of Contents Significant issuances of common shares or exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares As of February 21, 2017, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 335,019,046 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote, of which 49,672,636 million were held by our subsidiaries and entitled to vote. In addition, 11,918,025 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans, and 31,997,773 common shares were reserved for issuance upon exchange of outstanding Exchangeable Notes . The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act) or the exchange of Exchangeable Notes for common shares, would be dilutive to existing shareholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. "
7,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2016-02-26,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report, the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability Our operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these activity levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, can be highly volatile. For example, oil prices were as high as $107 per barrel during 2014 and were as low as $35 per barrel during 2015. Subsequent to year end, oil prices have continued to decline reaching a low of $26.21 per barrel on February 11, 2016. The decrease in oil prices has been caused by, among other things, an oversupply of crude oil and stagnant demand. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, affect both the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. In addition, weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand for oil and natural gas, the availability and demand for drilling equipment and pipeline capacity, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. As a result of the sustained reduction in the price of oil, the level of drilling, exploration and production activity declined in 2015, resulting in a corresponding decline in the demand for our drilling services and/or a reduction in our dayrates and rig utilization. Accordingly, the continuation of lower oil and natural gas prices or the further decline in such prices could have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and profitability. A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could also adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. A continuation of lower oil and natural gas prices could also affect our ability to retain 9Table of Contents skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries. Our business and profitability could be adversely affected by turmoil in the global economy Changes in general economic and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of the volatility of oil and natural gas prices and the depressed economic environment, we are unable to predict the level of exploration, drilling and production activities of our customers and whether our customers and/or vendors will be able to sustain their operations and fulfill their commitments and obligations. If oil prices remain low and/or global economic conditions remain tepid or deteriorate in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on the liquidity and operations of our customers, vendors and other worldwide business partners, which in turn could have a material impact on our results of operations and liquidity. Furthermore, these conditions may result in certain of our customers experiencing an inability to pay vendors, including us. In addition, we may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures by our customers, which in turn could lead to either over capacity or, in the case of a recovery in oil prices and the world wide economy, undercapacity, either of which could adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the global economic environment will not deteriorate again in the future due to one or more factors. We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations The oilfield services industry is very competitive. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, increased price competition, as we have observed over the past year in certain markets. In addition, in recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features has become an important factor in determining job awards. Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, which requires continued technological developments and increased capital expenditures, and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirements for equipment. New technologies, services or standards could render some of our services, drilling rigs or equipment obsolete. Another key factor in job award determinations is our ability to maintain a strong safety record. As a result of these and other competitive factors, we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share, utilization rates and/or day rates for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we have a number of customer contracts that will expire in 2016. Our ability to renew these contracts or obtain new contracts and the terms of any such contracts will depend on market conditions and our customers future drilling plans, which are subject to change. For example, during 2015, a number of oil and gas companies, including some of our customers, publicly announced significant reductions in their planned exploration and development spending. Due to the highly competitive nature of the industry, which can be exacerbated during periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we are currently experiencing, we may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts or, if we are able to, we may not be able to secure or improve existing day rates or other material terms, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our results of operations Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling and workover industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events. Accidents may occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and liquidity. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future making insurance prohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals; our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs, which could exacerbate the impact of our losses on our financial condition and liquidity. 10Table of Contents Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated, suspended or terminated without an early termination payment Most of our multi-well and term drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customer prior to its expiration. However, such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances, such as, but not limited to, non-performance caused by significant operational or equipment issues (such as destruction of a drilling rig that is not replaced within a specified period of time), sustained periods of downtime due to a force majeure event or other events beyond our control or some other breach of our contractual obligations, our customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us at all. In addition, some contracts may be suspended, rather than terminated early, for an extended period of time, in some cases without adequate compensation. The early termination or suspension of a contract may result in a rig being idle for an extended period of time, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, during periods of depressed market conditions, such as the one we are currently experiencing and which we expect to continue in 2016, we may be subject to an increased risk of our customers (including government-controlled entities) seeking to renegotiate, repudiate or terminate their contracts and/or to otherwise exert commercial influence to our disadvantage. During 2015, we experienced downward pricing pressure and decreased demand for our drilling services with existing customers, resulting in renegotiations of pricing and other terms in our drilling contracts with certain customers. Our customers ability to perform their obligations under the contract, including their ability to pay us or fulfill their indemnity obligations, may also be impacted by an economic or industry downturn or other adverse conditions in the oil and gas industry. If we were to sustain a loss and our customers were unable to honor its indemnification obligation and/or payment, it could adversely affect our liquidity. If our customers cancel some of our contracts, and we are unable to secure new contracts on a timely basis and/or on substantially similar terms  which may prove difficult during a depressed market  or if contracts are suspended for an extended period of time with or without adequate compensation or renegotiated with pricing or other terms less favorable to us, it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Our investment in CJES may lose significant value due to a decline in equity prices and other market-related risks We account for our investment in CJES using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting we would generally increase or decrease the value of our investment based on our allocable share of the net income (loss) of CJES. However, CJESs common shares are publicly traded on the NYSE, and a sustained decrease in the market price of these shares could result in future impairment of our investment. CJES and its common shares are subject to a wide variety of market-related risks, including, but not limited to, a decrease in the demand for service as a result of depressed oil and gas prices, the realization of any of which could cause a decrease in the trading price of those common shares, which in turn could cause us to recognize an impairment of our investment. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we determined the carrying value of our investment was other than temporarily impaired which resulted in an impairment charge of $180.6 million. As of the date of this annual report, the market price of CJES is trading below our carrying value. Should it remain at these levels for an extended period of time, it could result in a future other-than-temporary impairment. We may record additional losses or impairment charges related to sold or idle rigs In 2015, we recognized impairment charges of $118.1 million related to tangible assets and equipment. Prolonged periods of low utilization or low dayrates, the cold stacking of idle assets, the sale of assets below their then carrying value or the decline in market value of our assets may cause us to experience further losses. If future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, including oil and gas prices and expected utilization levels, indicate that the carrying value of any of our rigs may not be recoverable or if we sell assets for less than their then carrying value, we may recognize additional impairment charges on our fleet. The loss of one or a number of our large customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations In 2015, we received approximately 26% percent of our consolidated operating revenues from our three largest contract drilling customers (including their affiliates). 11Table of Contents The loss of one or more of our larger customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in Canada, South America, Mexico, the Middle East, the Far East, the South Pacific, Russia and Africa. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, political or economic instability, terrorist activity and governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contractual rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In some countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We are also subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. To the extent that any of these risks arising from our operations in global markets are realized, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $3.7 billion in outstanding debt. We also have various financial commitments, such as leases, firm transportation and processing, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generated by our operating subsidiaries operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our ability to access the capital markets and/or other sources of financing. If we cannot repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or reduce funding in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. Our ability to access capital markets could be limited From time to time, we may need to access capital markets to obtain long-term and short-term financing. However, our ability to access capital markets for long-term financing could be limited by, among other things, oil and gas prices, our existing capital structure, our credit ratings and the health of the drilling and overall oil and gas industry and the global economy. In addition, many of the factors that affect our ability to access capital markets, such as the liquidity of the overall capital markets and the state of the economy and oil and gas industry, are outside of our control. No assurance can be given that we will be able to access capital markets on terms acceptable to us when required to do so, which could adversely affect our business. A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital markets or other financing sources Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by the major U.S. credit rating agencies. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, the level of adjusted EBITDA, asset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, market diversity, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access capital markets or other financing sources in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit for certain obligations, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a holding company, we depend on our operating subsidiaries and investments to meet our financial obligations We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our operating subsidiaries and investment in unconsolidated affiliates, including CJES. In order to meet our financial needs, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flows from our operating subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay us dividends or sufficient cash flows to make payments of interest and principal to us. In addition, from time to time, our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements or be made subject to laws or regulations that restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. In addition, the ability of our equity method investees to make distributions on their stock is subject to their ability to generate cash flow, restrictions in their credit facilities and other indebtedness and applicable law. There can also be adverse tax consequences associated with our subsidiaries and equity method investees paying dividends to us. 12Table of Contents We may be subject to changes in tax laws and have additional tax liabilities We operate through various subsidiaries in numerous countries throughout the world. Consequently, we are subject to changes in tax laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof in the United States or jurisdictions in which we or any of our subsidiaries operate or are incorporated. Furthermore, the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) published a Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Action Plan in July 2013, seeking to reform the taxation of multinational companies. The recommendations made by the OECD may result in unilateral, uncoordinated changes in tax laws in the countries in which we operate or are incorporated, which may result in double taxation or otherwise increase our tax liabilities which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Tax laws, treaties and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation. Our income tax expense is based upon our interpretation of the tax laws in effect in various countries at the time that the expense was incurred. If these tax laws, treaties or regulations change or any tax authority successfully challenges our assessment of the effects of such laws, treaties and regulations in any country, including our operational structure, intercompany pricing policies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, this could have a material adverse effect on us, resulting in a higher effective tax rate on our consolidated earnings or a reclassification of the tax impact of our significant corporate restructuring transactions. Changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations Drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our cost of compliance with these laws may be substantial. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In August 2015, the EPA proposed standards to reduce methane emissions in the oil and gas industry. In addition, U.S. federal law strictly regulates the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances, and imposes liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, we are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials and the use of underground storage tanks. Changes in environmental laws may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the U.S. Congress that would reclassify some oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes under the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earths atmosphere, and other climatic changes. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States and the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, which establish greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Some international initiatives have been or may be adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions. In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, which may lead to further regulations of greenhouse gases emissions under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas sector. Future or more stringent regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate. The expansion of the scope of laws protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. Violation of environmental laws could lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. 13Table of Contents We rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction Our reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue to us, as well as an increase in operating costs. Additionally, our suppliers, manufacturers and service providers could be negatively impacted by current industry conditions or global economic conditions. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or equipment available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and equipment, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, and we have adopted policies and procedures and related training meant to ensure compliance, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have continued to focus on enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, they may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire. Historically, we have sought to avoid a coercive takeover by: ·                  Classifying our Board of Directors (Board) so that all the directors could not be replaced at a single meeting; ·                  Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares; ·                  Adopting a shareholder rights plan that limits the number of shares of our common stock a potential acquiror can purchase without either securing the approval of our Board or having their voting interest severely diluted. The plan is scheduled to expire in July 2016 unless it is extended; ·                  Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings; ·                  Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all the shareholders then entitled to vote; ·                  Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidates for election to our Board; and ·                  Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newly created seats on the Board. 14Table of Contents At the request of shareholders, we declassified the Board, which makes it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. The remaining provisions designed to avoid a coercive takeover may not be fully effective so that a party may still be able to acquire the Company without paying what the Board considers to be fair value, including a control premium. Conversely, such provisions could discourage a would-be acquiror and thus reduce the likelihood that shareholders would receive a premium for their shares in a takeover. Legal proceedings and governmental investigations could affect our financial condition and results of operations We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws or other whistle blower-related matters. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Item 3Legal Proceedings for a discussion of certain existing legal proceedings. The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success The successful execution of our business strategies will depend, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers. We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company, but no assurance can be given that any employee will remain with us, whether or not they have entered into an employment agreement with us. We do not carry key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions that we expect to further our business objectives. The anticipated benefits of such transactions may not be realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational and financial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees and significant transactional expenses, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Risks associated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksite data delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk, cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable. The occurrence of such an attack could go unnoticed for a period time. Any such attack could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares As of February 23, 2016, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 331,280,051 shares were outstanding and entitled to vote. In addition, 12,297,499 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act), would be dilutive to existing security holders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. "
5,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2015-03-02,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this report, the following factors should be carefully considered whenevaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Risks Related to the Business  Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and ourrevenues, cash flows and profitability          Our operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Bothshort-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, can be highlyvolatile. For example, within the past year, oil prices have been as high as $107 per barrel and have recently been as low as $44 per barrel in 2015. Worldwide military, political and economic events,including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and natural gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in theUnited States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, and other factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. Aprolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could depress the level of drilling, exploration and production activity and result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our servicesand/or a reduction in dayrates and utilization, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Lower oil and natural gas prices have caused some of our customers toterminate, seek to renegotiate or fail to honor our drilling contracts and affected the fair market value of our rig fleet, which in turn has resulted in impairments of our assets. For the year endedDecember 31, 2014, we recorded impairment charges of approximately $1.0 billion, reflecting the effect of the recent decline in oil prices on our assets. If there is a prolonged periodof lower oil and natural gas prices, it could adversely impact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which couldresult in future impairment to our long-lived assets. A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could also affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability toaccess capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield servicesindustries. We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adverselyaffect our results of operations          The oilfield services industry is very competitive. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competitionmay vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Most rigs and drilling-related equipment can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity andmarket conditions, which may result in anoversupply of such rigs and drilling-related equipment in certain areas, and accordingly, significant price competition. In addition, in recent years, the ability to deliver rigs with new technologyand features has become an important factor in determining job awards. Our customers are increasingly demanding the services of newer, higher specification drilling rigs, which requires continuedtechnological developments and increased capital expenditures, and our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and services and changes in customer requirementsfor equipment. As a result of these and other competitive factors, we may be unable to maintain or increase our market share, utilization 12 Table of Contentsratesand/or prices for our services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our drilling contracts may in certain instances be renegotiated or terminated without an earlytermination payment          Most of our drilling contracts require that an early termination payment be made to us if a contract is terminated by the customerprior to its expiration. Such payments may not fully compensate us for the loss of a contract, and in certain circumstances, such as, but not limited to, destruction of a drilling rig that is notreplaced within a specified period of time or other breach of our contractual obligations, the customer may not be obligated to make an early termination payment to us. During depressed marketconditions or otherwise, customers may seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor their contractual obligations for various reasons, including those described above. The renegotiation ortermination of such contracts without an adequate early termination payment could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our resultsof operations          Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover and well-servicing and pressure pumping industries,including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclementweather or natural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and naturalresources damage and damage to the property of others. Our offshore operations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes andheavy weather or sea conditions and unsound oceanbottom conditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events.         Accidentsmay occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event not fully insured orindemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, insurance may not beavailable to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may increase significantly in the future making insuranceprohibitively expensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals; our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable ormore expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We maychoose to increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs. The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terroristactivity or other political or economic instability, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and local import and export controls          We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in Canada, South America, Mexico, theMiddle East, the Far East, the South Pacific, Russia and Africa. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, political or economic instability, terrorist activityand governmental actions that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In somecountries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the 13 Table of Contentsoperationand taxation of our business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain. As a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations          We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs, werely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from our subsidiaries.There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay us dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us. In addition,from time to time, our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. There can also be adverse tax consequencesassociated with paying dividends. Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financialcommitments          As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $4.4 billion in outstanding debt. We also have various financialcommitments, such as leases, firm transportation and processing, contracts and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other financial obligations depends in large part upon thelevel of cash flows generated by our subsidiaries' operations, our ability to monetize and/or divest non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our ability toaccess the capital markets. A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital          Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings asprovided by the major U.S. credit rating agencies and our historical ability to access those markets as needed. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, planned asset purchasesor sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are also considered by the ratingagencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to post letters of credit forcertain obligations. The loss of key executives or inability to attract and retain experienced technical personnel couldreduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success          The successful execution of our business strategies will depend, in part, on the continued service of certain key executive officers.We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company. We do not carry significant amounts of key man insurance. In addition, our operations depend, in part, on our abilityto attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers and/or our inability to retain or attract experiencedtechnical personnel, could reduce our competitiveness and harm prospects for future success, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilitiescould adversely affect our results of operations          Drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our cost ofcompliance with these laws may be substantial. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has promulgated rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable tocertain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural 14 Table of Contentsgasproduction, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In addition, U.S. federal law strictly regulates the prevention of oil spills and the release of hazardous substances,and imposes liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint andseveral liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator of onshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be aresponsible party under federal law. In addition, our completion and production services operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of materials, some of which are classified assolid or hazardous wastes or hazardous substances. We are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials, the use ofunderground storage tanks and the use of underground injection wells. We employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be requiredfrom time to time and also use consultants to advise on and assist with our environmental compliance efforts. Liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and/or remedialefforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated.         Changesin environmental laws may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. Forexample, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the U.S. Congress that would reclassify some oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes under the Resources Conservation andRecovery Act, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act providesthe federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where weoperate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earth's atmosphere, and other climatic changes.The U.S. Congress has considered legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the RegionalGreenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States and the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, which establish greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Someinternational initiatives have also been adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions. In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhousegases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, paving the way for further regulations that could restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean AirAct. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from oil and natural gas systems. Future or more stringent regulation could dramatically increaseoperating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate.         Theexpansion of the scope of laws protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. The violationof environmental laws can lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations, and in some cases injunctive relief. Violations may also result in liabilitiesfor personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims. We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it ispossible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. 15 Table of ContentsChanges in environmental laws related to hydraulic fracturing or other operations could result inincreased costs of compliance and reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the demand for fracturing and other services or ourresults of operations          Operations in our Completion Services operating segment include hydraulic fracturing, a process sometimes used in the completion of oiland gas wells whereby water,sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. Hydraulic fracturing activities are currently exempt under the SafeDrinking Water Act (""SDWA""), except for such activities that use diesel fuel, for which the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over and issued permitting guidance on in February 2014. In2012, the EPA promulgated new rules establishing new air emission controls for oil and gas production and natural gas processing operations. More recently, in May 2014, the EPA issued an advancednotice of proposed rulemaking regarding the agency's intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances and Control Act related to the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. TheEPA is also conducting a study of the potential environmental impacts from hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources and developing rules on effluent limitations for the treatment and dischargeof wastewater resulting from hydraulic fracturing activities, both which are expected for publication in early 2015. In addition, the federal Bureau of Land Management has proposed new requirements onhydraulic fracturing conducted on federal lands, including the disclosure of chemical additives used. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy released a report on hydraulic fracturing, recommending theimplementation of a variety of measures to reduce the environmental impacts from shale-gas production. In addition, there has been public opposition to hydraulic fracturing. As a result, there havebeen legislative initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or under newly established legislation. From time to time, legislation has also been introduced in theU.S. Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require the disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, various statesand local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permit requirements, operational restrictions, disclosurerequirements and temporary or permanent bans. For example, Texas has adopted legislation that requires the public disclosure of information regarding the substances used in the hydraulic fracturingprocess, and, on December 17, 2014, the State of New York announced a ban on hydraulic fracturing due to public health and environmental concerns identified in its several years study. Inaddition, municipalities in Colorado and several other states have adopted or are in the process of adopting ordinances restricting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing within their jurisdictions. Newor further changes in laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise banning or limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil andnatural gas wells in shale formations, cause operational delays, increase costs of regulatory compliance or in exploration and production, which could adversely affect our business and the demand forfracturing services. Any violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws couldhave a negative impact on us          A significant portion of our revenue is derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S.regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act(""FCPA"") and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtainingor retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations ofthese laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties, and the SEC and U.S.Department of Justice have increased their enforcement 16 Table of Contentsactivitieswith respect to the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results ofoperations. Significant exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares          As of February 26, 2015, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 329,376,998 shares were outstanding. In addition,19,449,499 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the publicmarket, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act), would be dilutive to existing securityholders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeoverattempt; conversely, they may deter a change of control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium          Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire.Historically, we have sought to avoid a coercive takeover by: Classifying our Board of Directors (""Board"") so that all the directors could not be replaced at a single meeting;   Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as to determinethe price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our common shares;   Adopting a shareholder rights plan that limits the number of shares of our common stock a potential acquiror can purchase withouteither securing the approval of our Board or having their voting interest severely diluted. The plan is scheduled to expire in July 2016 unless it is extended;   Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings;   Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed by all theshareholders then entitled to vote;  Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination of candidatesfor election to our Board; and  Reserving to our Board the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fill vacancies or newlycreated seats on the Board.         Atthe request of shareholders, we declassified the Board, which makes it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. The remaining provisions designed to avoid acoercive takeover may not be fully effective so that a party may still be able to acquire the Company without paying what the Board considers to be fair value, including a control premium. Conversely,such provisions could discourage a would-be acquiror and thus reduce the likelihood that shareholders would receive a premium for their shares in a takeover. We may have additional tax liabilities          Income tax returns that we file will be subject to review and examination. We will not recognize the benefit of income tax positions webelieve are more likely than not to be disallowed upon challenge by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges our operational structure, intercompany 17 Table of Contentspricingpolicies or the taxable presence of our subsidiaries in certain countries, if the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to our structure, or if welose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Legal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations          We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectualproperty and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time totime, alleging violations of employment-related laws. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by turmoil in the global financialand commodity markets          Changes in general financial and political conditions may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operationsand cash flows in ways that we cannot predict. If global financial and commodity markets and economic conditions deteriorate in the future, there could be a material adverse impact on our liquidityand those of our customers and otherworldwide business partners. For example, as a result of a dramatic decline in oil prices in the fourth quarter of 2014 which remained suppressed into 2015, our customers have reduced or curtailedtheir capital spending and drilling activities. As a result, we and our customers may experience difficulties forecasting future capital expenditures, which in turn could negatively impact theworldwide rig count and our future financial results. We previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, andour business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective          Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct acomprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. As part of this process, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; management isrequired to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of ourinternal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of humanerror, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financialstatements.         Wehave identified a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for and disclosures related to a non-routine complex legal entity restructuring in the interim consolidatedfinancial statements. A more complete description of this material weakness is included in Item 9A, ""Controls and Procedures"" in this Form 10-K, together with our remediation plan.         Theexistence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meetour reporting obligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. 18 Table of ContentsFailure to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, divestitures and other strategictransactions may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial position          We undertake from time to time acquisitions, divestitures and other strategic transactions, such as the proposed Merger with CJES, thatwe expect to further our business objectives. The anticipated benefits of such transactions may not be realized, or may be realized more slowly than expected, and may result in operational andfinancial consequences, including, but not limited to, the loss of key customers, suppliers or employees and significant transactional expenses, which may have an adverse effect on our business,results of operations and financial position. Our business is subject to cybersecurity risks          Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. Risksassociated with these threats include, among other things, loss of intellectual property, disruption of our and customers' business operations and safety procedures, loss or damage to our worksitedata delivery systems, and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity events. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to mitigate our exposure to such risk,cybersecurity attacks are evolving and unpredictable. The occurrence of such an attack could go unnoticed for a period time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. Risks Related to the Merger  The Merger is subject to customary approvals and conditions which may adversely impact the timing ofthe transaction and our ability to consummate the transaction          In June 2014, we and certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries, including Nabors Red Lion Limited (""Red Lion""), agreed to the proposedMerger with CJES. Under the amended terms of the Merger and related transactions, we expect to receive total consideration comprised of approximately $688 million in cash and approximately62.5 million common shares in thecombined company upon the closing of the Merger. The Merger is subject to customary approvals and conditions, many of which are outside of our control, including, among others, the approval of theMerger by the holders of a majority of outstanding CJES common stock and the availability of the proceeds of CJES's debt financing to effect the cash payment to us at closing. Although we expect theMerger to be completed in March of 2015 following the special meeting of CJES stockholders on March 20, 2015, we cannot assure you that the Merger will be consummated within the anticipatedtime period or at all, including as the result of regulatory, market or other factors. Further, any delay in the consummation of the Merger could result in additional transaction costs or othereffects associated with uncertainty about the Merger, which may adversely impact our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the transaction.         Inaddition, failure to consummate the Merger could have an adverse effect on our business for a number of reasons, including that we will have incurred significant transaction costswithout achieving the anticipated benefits from the transaction, including the expected cash payment from CJES, and will have lost the opportunity to pursue other strategic transactions. In addition,the market and price for our common stock could be adversely impacted from such delay or failure. Following completion of the Merger, we will not be able to exert complete control over New C&J          Following the completion of the Merger, we will own 53% of the outstanding and issued common shares of the newly combined company.While we will have the ability to exert a significant degree of influence as a substantial shareholder, we will not be able to directly manage the daily operations of the newly combined company,including our Completion & Production Services business line, and will not be able to exert complete control over the decision-making of the board of directors of the newly combined company,including with respect to cash distributions to shareholders or the transfer of assets, under normal circumstances. 19 Table of Contents"
3,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2014-03-03,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this report, the following factors should be carefully considered whenevaluating Nabors. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.         Ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cash flows and profitability          Our operations depend on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration, development and production activities. Bothshort-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect these levels. Oil and natural gas prices, as well as the level of drilling, exploration and production activity, can be highlyvolatile. Worldwide military, political and economic events, including initiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, affect both the demand for, and the supply of, oil and naturalgas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the United States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, and other factors beyond our control mayalso affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas. Lower oil and natural gas prices have caused some of our customers to terminate, seek to renegotiate or fail to honor our drillingcontracts and affected the fair market value of our rig fleet, which in turn has resulted in impairments of our assets. A sustained or further decline in oil and natural gas prices could adverselyimpact our cash forecast models used to determine whether the carrying value of our long-lived assets exceed our future cash flows, which could result in future impairment to our long-lived assets. Aprolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel and affect our ability to access capital to finance and grow our business. There can be noassurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas and oilfield services industries.  We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adversely affect our results of operations          The oilfield services industry is very competitive. Contract drilling companies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competitionmay vary significantly from region to region at any particular time. Many drilling, workover and well-servicing rigs can be moved from one region to another in response to changes in levels ofactivity and market conditions, which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area. In many markets where we operate, the number of rigs available for use exceeds the demand for rigs, resulting inprice competition. In recent years the ability to deliver rigs with new technology and features can determine which drilling contractor is awarded a job, which requires continued technologyadvancement. The land drilling market generally is more competitive than the offshore drilling market because there are a greater number of rigs and competitors.  The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that could adversely affect our results of operations          Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover and well-servicing and pressure pumping industries,including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control, loss of or damage to the wellbore or underground reservoir, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclementweather or natural disasters. Any of thesehazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to or destruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental and natural resources damage and damage to the propertyof others. Our 12 Table of Contentsoffshoreoperations involve the additional hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottomconditions. Our operations are also subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events.         Accidentsmay occur, we may be unable to obtain desired contractual indemnities, and our insurance may prove inadequate in certain cases. The occurrence of an event not fully insured orindemnified against, or the failure or inability of a customer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, insurance may not beavailable to cover any or all of these risks. Even if available, insurance may be inadequate or insurance premiums or other costs may rise significantly in the future making insurance prohibitivelyexpensive. We expect to continue facing upward pressure in our insurance renewals; our premiums and deductibles may be higher, and some insurance coverage may either be unavailable or more expensivethan it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible or self-insured retention. We may choose to increasethe levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time in order to minimize our overall costs.  The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by war, civil disturbance, terrorist activity or other political or economic turmoil, fluctuation in currencyexchange rates and local import and export controls          We derive a significant portion of our business from global markets, including major operations in Canada, South America, Mexico, theMiddle East, the Far East, the South Pacific, Russia and Africa. These operations are subject to various risks, including war, civil disturbances, terrorist activity and governmental actions that maylimit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. In some countries, our operations may besubject to the additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange controls. We are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and theimport and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain.  As a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations          We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries. In order to meet our financial needs, werely exclusively on repayments of interest and principal on intercompany loans that we have made to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and other cash flow from our subsidiaries.There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries will generate sufficient net income to pay us dividends or sufficient cash flow to make payments of interest and principal to us. In addition,from time to time, our operating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements that contractually restrict or prohibit these types of upstream payments. There can also be adverse tax consequencesassociated with paying dividends.  Our financial and operating flexibility could be affected by our long-term debt and other financial commitments          As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $3.9 billion in outstanding long-term debt. We also have variouscommitments for leases, firm transportation and processing, and purchase commitments. Our ability to service our debt and other obligations depends in large part upon the level of cash flows generatedby our subsidiaries' operations, possible dispositions of non-core assets, availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility and our ability to access the capital markets. 13 Table of Contents A downgrade in our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of and ability to access capital          Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings asprovided by the major credit rating agencies in the United States and our historical ability to access those markets as needed. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include debt levels, plannedasset purchases or sales, and near-term and long-term production growth opportunities. Liquidity, asset quality, cost structure, product mix, and commodity pricing levels and others are alsoconsidered by the rating agencies. A ratings downgrade could adversely impact our ability to access debt markets in the future, increase the cost of future debt, and potentially require us to postletters of credit for certain obligations.  The loss of key executives or difficulty attracting and retaining experienced technical personnel could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success          The successful execution of the strategies central to our future success will depend, in part, on a few of our key executive officers.We have employment agreements with some of our key personnel within the company. We do not carry significant amounts of key man insurance. Our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract andretain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of key executive officers, or our inability to retain or attract experienced technical personnel,could harm our ability to compete.  Noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations          Drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate. Our cost ofcompliance with these laws may be substantial. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has promulgated rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable tocertain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities. In addition, U.S. federal law strictlyregulates the prevention of oil spills, release of hazardous substances, and imposes liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arisingfrom any spills. Some of these laws may impose strict and/or joint and several liability for clean-up costs and damages without regard to the conduct of the parties. As an owner and operator ofonshore and offshore rigs and other equipment, we may be deemed to be a responsible party under federal law. In addition, our completion and production services operations routinely involve thehandling of significant amounts of materials, some of which are classified as solid or hazardous wastes or hazardous substances. We are subject to various laws governing the containment and disposalof hazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks and the use of underground injection wells. We employ personnel responsible for monitoringenvironmental compliance and arranging for remedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use consultants to advise on and assist with our environmental compliance efforts.Liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated.         Changesin environmental laws may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. Forexample, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the U.S. Congress that would reclassify some oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes under the Resources Conservation andRecovery Act, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act providesthe federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where weoperate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that 14 Table of Contentsmaycontribute to warming of the Earth's atmosphere, and other climatic changes. The U.S. Congress has considered legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in whichwe operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States and the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, whichestablish greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs. Some international initiatives have also been adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions.In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, paving the way for further regulations that could restrictemissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act. The EPA has already issued rules requiring monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas systems.Future or more stringent regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfieldsuneconomical to operate.  Changes in environmental laws related to hydraulic fracturing or other operations could result in increased costs of compliance and reductions or delays in drilling andcompleting new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the demand for fracturing and other services or our results of operations          Operations in our Completion Services operating segment include hydraulic fracturing, a process sometimes used in the completion of oiland gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production. Hydraulic fracturing activities arecurrently exempt under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, except for those using diesel fuel, for which the EPA has asserted regulatory authority and is drafting guidance documents. The EPA is alsoconducting a study of the potential environmental impacts from hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. In addition, the federal Bureau of Land Management has imposed new requirements onhydraulic fracturing conducted on federal lands, including the disclosure of chemical additives used. In 2011, the U.S. Department of Energy released a report on hydraulic fracturing, recommending theimplementation of a variety of measures to reduce the environmental impacts from shale-gas production. In addition, there has been public opposition to hydraulic fracturing. As a result, there havebeen legislative initiatives to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act or under newly established legislation. Legislation has also been introduced in the U.S. Congress andadopted or introduced in some states requiring disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process. If enacted, the legislation could require fracturing activities to meet permitting and financialassurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and meet plugging and abandonment requirements. The EPA hasindicated an intent to regulate wastewater discharges under the Federal Clean Water Act from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production. In 2012, the EPA also promulgated new rulesestablishing new air emission controls for oil and gas production and natural gas processing operations. These rules require, among other things, controlling emissions through flaring until 2015 andthereafter through reduced emissions completions,as well as imposing new requirements on emissions from tanks and other equipment. These rules and any other new laws regulating exploration, production and completion activities could causeoperational delays, increased costs of compliance or increased costs in exploration and production, which could adversely affect our business and the demand for fracturing services.  Significant exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares          As of February 24, 2014, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 324,921,245 shares were outstanding. In addition,29,004,477 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans. The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the publicmarket, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act), would be dilutive to 15 Table of Contentsexistingsecurity holders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.  Provisions in our organizational documents may be insufficient to thwart a coercive hostile takeover attempt; conversely, they may deter a change of control transaction anddecrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium          Companies generally seek to prevent coercive takeovers by parties unwilling to pay fair value for the enterprise they acquire.Historically, we have sought to avoid a coercive takeover by:Classifying our Board of Directors so that all the directors could not be replaced at a single meeting.  Authorizing the Board to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, as well as todetermine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, in each case without any vote or action by the holders of our commonshares. Adopting a shareholder rights plan that limits the number of shares of our common stock a potential acquiror can purchasewithout either securing the approval of our Board of Directors or having their voting interest severely diluted. The plan is scheduled to expire in July 2016 unless it is extended.  Limiting the ability of our shareholders to call or bring business before special meetings.  Prohibiting our shareholders from taking action by written consent in lieu of a meeting unless the consent is signed byall the shareholders then entitled to vote. Requiring advance notice of shareholder proposals for business to be conducted at general meetings and for nomination ofcandidates for election to our Board of Directors; and Reserving to our Board of Directors the ability to determine the number of directors comprising the full Board and to fillvacancies or newly created seats on the Board.         Atthe request of shareholders, we declassified the Board, which makes it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company. The remaining provisions designed to avoid acoercive takeover might not be fully effective so a party might still be able to acquire the Company without paying what the Board considers to be fair value, including a control premium.         Onthe other hand, some shareholders view the foregoing provisions as too likely to discourage a would-be acquiror and thus to reduce the likelihood that shareholders would receive apremium for their shares in a takeover.  We may have additional tax liabilities          We are subject to income taxes in numerous other jurisdictions, including the United States. Significant judgment is required indetermining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We areregularly audited by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than what isreflected in income tax provisions and accruals. An audit or litigation could materially affect our financial position, income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periodschallenged. It is also possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties) could impact our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date. 16 Table of Contents Legal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations          We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectualproperty and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time totime, alleging violations of employment-related laws. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by turmoil in the global financial markets          The changes in general financial and political conditions, including the U.S. government budget, the downgrade by Standard &Poor's of the credit rating of U.S. government securities and concerns over the European sovereign debt crisis and banking industry has created a great deal of uncertainty in the recovery of the worldeconomy. If global economic uncertainties continue over a prolonged period of time or develop adversely, there could be a material adverse impact on our credit ratings and liquidity and those of ourcustomers and other worldwide business partners. If global oil and gas prices were to decline rapidly, it could lead our customers to curtail their operations or expansion and cause difficulties forus and our customers to forecast future capitalexpenditures, which in turn could negatively impact the worldwide rig count and our future financial results"

Petrello, with a term through March 30, 2015, and other key personnel within the company. We do not carry significant amounts of key man insurance.  Our operations depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced technical professionals. Competition for such professionals is intense. The loss of Mr. Petrello or other key executive officers, or our inability to attract or retain experienced technical personnel, could harm our ability to compete. Noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations Drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various laws, rules and regulations in the various jurisdictions in where we operate.

For example,  the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has promulgated rules requiring the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions applicable to certain offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities beginning in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011.  In addition, U.S. federal law imposes on responsible parties a variety of regulations related to the prevention of oil spills, release of hazardous substances, and liability for removal costs and natural resource, real or personal property and certain economic damages arising from such incidents.

Liabilities are recorded when the need for environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. The expansion of the scope of laws protecting the environment has accelerated in recent years, particularly outside the United States, and we expect this trend to continue. The violation of environmental laws can lead to the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations, and in some cases injunctive relief.  Violations may also result in liabilities for personal injuries, property and natural resource damage and other costs and claims.  We are not always successful in allocating all risks of these environmental liabilities to customers, and it is possible that customers who assume the risks will be financially unable to bear any resulting costs. Changes in environmental laws related to hydraulic fracturing or other operations could result in increased costs of compliance and reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells, which could adversely impact the demand for fracturing and other services or our results of operations Operations in our Completion Services operating segment include hydraulic fracturing, a process sometimes used in the completion of oil and gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and, to a lesser extent, oil production.

Legislation has also been introduced in the U.S. Congress and adopted or introduced in some states requiring disclosure of chemicals used in the fracturing process.  If enacted, the legislation could require fracturing activities to meet permitting and financial assurance requirements, adhere to certain construction specifications, fulfill monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping requirements and meet plugging and abandonment requirements.  EPA has indicated an intent to regulate wastewater discharges under the Federal Clean Water Act from hydraulic fracturing and other natural gas production.  In 2012, EPA also promulgated new rules establishing new air emission controls for oil and gas production and natural gas processing operations.  These rules require, among other things, controlling emissions through flaring until 2015 and thereafter through reduced emissions completions, as well as imposing new requirements on emissions from tanks and other equipment.   These rules and any other new laws regulating production and completion activities could cause operational delays, increased costs of compliance or increased costs in exploration and production, which could adversely affect our business and the demand for fracturing services. Changes in environmental laws may also negatively impact the operations of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us. For example, legislation has been proposed from time to time in the U.S. Congress that would reclassify some oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes under the Resources Conservation and Recovery Act, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent and costly handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas production sites. Legislators and regulators in the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate also focus increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases that may contribute to warming of the Earths atmosphere, and other climatic changes.  The U.S. Congress has considered legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases, and some states in which we operate have passed legislation or adopted initiatives, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the northeastern United States and the Western Regional Climate Action Initiative, which establish greenhouse gas inventories and/or cap-and-trade programs.  Some international initiatives have also been adopted, which could result in increased costs of operations in covered jurisdictions.  In addition, the EPA has published findings that emissions of greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment, paving the way for further regulations that could restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act.   Future or more stringent regulation could dramatically increase operating costs for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making wells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate. 13Table of Contents Significant exercises of stock options could adversely affect the market price of our common shares As of February 25, 2013, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 319,449,700 shares were outstanding. In addition, 37,726,170 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuant to stock option and employee benefit plans.  The sale, or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resulting from the exercise of options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act), would be dilutive to existing security holders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities. Provisions in our organizational documents may deter a change-of-control transaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change-of-control premium; conversely, those provisions may be insufficient to thwart an attempt to acquire control without paying a control premium The Board of Directors has the authority to issue a significant number of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares, and to determine the price, rights (including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares, without any vote or action by shareholders.  In 2012, the Board of Directors adopted a shareholder rights plan that limits the voting power a person can acquire without either securing the approval of the Board or having their voting interest diluted.  The plan will expire in July 2013 unless it is extended.  Although these provisions are designed to enhance the ability of the Board to negotiate with a potential acquiror to ensure that all shareholders receive fair value in exchange for control of the Company, they may also discourage potential acquirors and thus reduce the possibility of a takeover and therefore the likelihood that shareholders would receive a premium for their shares. Conversely, we declassified our Board in 2012, which makes it easier for another party to acquire control of the Company.  If the shareholder rights plan is not extended beyond July 2013, the ability of the Board to maximize value for all shareholders in a change-of-control transaction may be further diminished. 14Table of Contents We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are regularly audited by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than what is reflected in income tax provisions and accruals. An audit or litigation could materially affect our financial position, income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods challenged.  It is also possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties) could impact our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date. Proposed tax legislation could mitigate or eliminate the benefits of our 2002 reorganization as a Bermuda company Various bills have been introduced in the U.S. Congress that could reduce or eliminate the tax benefits associated with our 2002 reorganization as a Bermuda company. There has been and we expect that there may continue to be legislation proposed by the U.S. Congress from time to time which, if enacted, could limit or eliminate the tax benefits associated with our reorganization. No assurance can be given that the tax benefits associated with our reorganization will continue to accrue to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. Legal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations We are subject to legal proceedings and governmental investigations from time to time that include employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action and shareholder derivative actions. We are also subject to complaints and allegations from former, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. The profitability of our operations could be adversely affected by turmoil in the global financial markets The changes in general financial and political conditions, including the U.S. government budget, the downgrade by Standard & Poors of the credit rating of U.S. government securities and concerns over the European sovereign debt crisis and banking industry has created a great deal of uncertainty in the recovery of the world economy. If global economic uncertainties continue over a prolonged period of time or develop adversely, there could be a material adverse impact on our credit ratings and liquidity and those of our customers and other worldwide business partners. If global oil and gas prices were to decline rapidly, it could lead our customers to curtail their operations or expansion and cause difficulties for us and our customers to forecast future capital expenditures, which in turn could negatively impact the worldwide rig count and our future financial results. "

4,NBR,NABORS INDUSTRIES LTD,2009-03-02,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the followingfactors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors. The risks described below are notthe only ones facing Nabors. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deemimmaterial may also impair our business operations.     Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adverselyaffected by any of these risks.Uncertain or negative global economic conditions could adversely affect our results of operations     During recent months, there has been substantial volatility and a decline in oil and naturalgas prices due, at least in part, to the deteriorating global economic environment. In addition,there has been substantial uncertainty in the capital markets and access to financing is uncertain.These conditions could have an adverse effect on our industry and our business, including ourfuture operating results and the ability to recover our assets, including goodwill, at their statedvalues. Many of our customers have curtailed their drilling programs, which, in many cases, hasresulted in a decrease in demand for drilling rigs and a reduction in dayrates and utilization.Additionally, some customers have terminated drilling contracts prior to the expiration of theirterms. A prolonged period of lower oil and natural gas prices could result in a continued declinein demand and/or dayrates. In addition, certain of our customers could experience an inability topay suppliers, including our Company, in the event they are unable to access the capital markets tofund their business operations. Likewise, our suppliers may be unable to sustain their currentlevel of operations, fulfill their commitments and/or fund future operations and obligations. Eachof these could adversely affect our operations.Fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and ourrevenues, cash flows and profitability     Our operations are materially dependent upon the level of activity in oil and gas explorationand production. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and natural gas prices affect the levelof such activity. Oil and natural gas prices and, therefore, the level of drilling, exploration andproduction activity can be volatile. Worldwide military, political and economic events, includinginitiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, may affect both the demand for,and the supply of, oil and natural gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in theUnited States and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, andother factors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas.The recent volatility and the effects of the recent significant decline in natural gas and oilprices is likely to continue in the near future, especially given the general contraction in theworlds economy that began during 2008. We believe that any prolonged suppression of oil andnatural gas prices would continue to depress the level of exploration and production activity. Thiswould likely result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our services and could have anadverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and profitability. Lower oil and natural gas pricescould also cause our customers to seek to terminate, renegotiate or fail to honor our drillingcontracts; affect the fair market value of our rig fleet which in turn could trigger a write-downfor accounting purposes; affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel; and affect our abilityto obtain access to capital to finance and grow our business. There can be no assurances as to thefuture level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil and natural gas andoilfield services industries.We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adverselyaffect our results of operations     The oilfield services industry in which we operate is very competitive. Contract drillingcompanies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from regionto region at any particular time. Many drilling, workover and well-servicing rigs can be moved fromone region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and market conditions, which mayresult in an oversupply of rigs in an area. In many markets in which we operate, the number of rigsavailable for use exceeds the demand for rigs, resulting in price competition. Most drilling andworkover contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids, which also results in pricecompetition. The land drilling market generally is more competitive than the offshore drillingmarket because there are larger numbers of rigs and competitors.The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that, if not insured or indemnifiedagainst, could adversely affect our results of operations     Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover andwell-servicing industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control,loss of hole, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather ornatural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to ordestruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental damage and damageto the property of others. Our offshore operations are also9Table of Contentssubject to the hazards of marine operations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damagefrom hurricanes and heavy weather or sea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. Inaddition, our international operations are subject to risks of war, civil disturbances or otherpolitical events. Generally, drilling contracts provide for the division of responsibilitiesbetween a drilling company and its customer, and we seek to obtain indemnification from ourcustomers by contract for certain of these risks. To the extent that we are unable to transfer suchrisks to customers by contract or indemnification agreements, we seek protection through insurance.However, there is no assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequatelyprotect us against liability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. Theoccurrence of an event not fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure or inability of acustomer or insurer to meet its indemnification or insurance obligations, could result insubstantial losses. In addition, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available tocover any or all of these risks, or, even if available, that it will be adequate or that insurancepremiums or other costs will not rise significantly in the future, so as to make such insuranceprohibitive. It is possible that we will face continued upward pressure in our upcoming insurancerenewals, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either willbe unavailable or more expensive than it has been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coveragegenerally provides that we assume a portion of the risk in the form of a deductible. We may chooseto increase the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to timein order to minimize the overall cost to the Company.Future price declines may result in a write-down of our asset carrying values     We follow the successful efforts method of accounting for our consolidated subsidiaries oiland gas activities. Under the successful efforts method, lease acquisition costs and alldevelopment costs are capitalized. Our provision for depletion is based on these capitalized costsand is determined on a property-by-property basis using the units-of-production method, with costsbeing amortized over proved developed reserves. Proved oil and gas properties are reviewed whencircumstances suggest the need for such a review and, if required, the proved properties arewritten down to their estimated fair value. Unproved properties are reviewed periodically todetermine if there has been impairment of the carrying value, with any such impairment charged toexpense in that period. The estimated fair value of our proved reserves generally declines whenthere is a significant and sustained decline in oil and natural gas prices. Because of the lownatural gas prices at December 31, 2008, we performed an impairment test on our oil and gasproperties of our wholly owned Ramshorn business unit. As a result, we recorded a non-cash pre-taximpairment to our oil and gas properties which totaled $21.5 million. A sustained decrease in oiland natural gas prices could require a write-down of the value of our proved oil and gas propertiesif the estimated fair value of these properties falls below their net book value.     Our oil and gas joint ventures, which we account for under the equity method of accounting,utilize the full-cost method of accounting for costs related to oil and natural gas properties.Under this method, all such costs (for both productive and nonproductive properties) arecapitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties usingthe units-of-production method. However, these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test whichlimits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributableto proved oil and natural gas reserves, discounted at 10%, plus the lower of cost or market valueof unproved properties. The full-cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter using thencurrent prices for oil and natural gas, adjusted for the impact of derivatives accounted for ascash flow hedges. Our U.S., international and Canadian joint ventures have recorded non-cashpre-tax full cost ceiling test writedowns of which $228.3 million represents our proportionateshare of the writedowns recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2008. Any sustainedfurther decline in oil and natural gas prices, or other factors, without other mitigatingcircumstances, could cause other future write-downs of capitalized costs and non-cash assetimpairments that could adversely affect our results of operations.The profitability of our international operations could be adversely affected by war, civildisturbance, or political or economic turmoil, fluctuation in currency exchange rates and localimport and export controls     We derive a significant portion of our business from international markets, including majoroperations in Canada, South America, Mexico, the Caribbean, the Middle East, the Far East, Russiaand Africa. These operations are subject to various risks, including the risk of war, civildisturbances and governmental activities that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movementof funds or result in the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without faircompensation. In certain countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk offluctuating currency values and exchange controls. In the international markets in which weoperate, we are subject to various laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation ofour business and the import and export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition,application and interpretation of which can prove to be uncertain.Changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilitiescould adversely affect our results of operations     The drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various federal, state, local and foreignlaws, rules and regulations. Our cost of compliance with these laws, rules and regulations may besubstantial. For example, federal law imposes a variety of regulations on responsible partiesrelated to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an owner andoperator of onshore and offshore rigs and transportation equipment, we may be deemed to be aresponsible party under federal law. In addition,10Table of Contentsour well-servicing, workover and production services operations routinely involve the handlingof significant amounts of waste materials, some of which are classified as hazardous substances.Our operations and facilities are subject to numerous state and federal environmental laws, rulesand regulations, including, without limitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal ofhazardous substances, oilfield waste and other waste materials, the use of underground storagetanks and the use of underground injection wells. We generally require customers to contractuallyassume responsibility for compliance with environmental regulations. However, we are not alwayssuccessful in allocating to customers all of these risks nor is there any assurance that thecustomer will be financially able to bear those risks assumed.     We employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging forremedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use consultants to advise on andassist with our environmental compliance efforts. Liabilities are recorded when the need forenvironmental assessments and/or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can bereasonably estimated.     Laws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent than in the past and areexpected to continue to become more so. Violation of environmental laws and regulations can lead tothe imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations, and in somecases injunctive relief. Such violations could also result in liabilities for personal injuries,property damage, and other costs and claims.     Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known asCERCLA or Superfund, and related state laws and regulations, liability can be imposed jointly onthe entire group of responsible parties or separately on any one of the responsible parties,without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons thatcontributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Under CERCLA, suchpersons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been releasedinto the environment and for damages to natural resources.     Changes in federal and state environmental regulations may also negatively impact oil andnatural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have an adverse effect on us.For example, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress which would reclassifycertain oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous wastes, which would make thereclassified wastes subject to more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. Also,there are regulatory developments occurring in the domestic and international sectors in which weoperate that are focused on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and othergreenhouse gases that may be contributing to warming of the Earths atmosphere, including theUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, also known as the Kyoto Protocol (aninternationally applied protocol but one that the United States is not a participating member), theRegional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeastern United States, the Western Regional ClimateAction Initiative in the Western United States, and the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision inMassachusetts, et al. v. EPA that greenhouse gases are an air pollutant under the federal CleanAir Act and thus subject to future regulation. The enactment of such hazardous waste legislationor future or more stringent regulation of greenhouse gases could dramatically increase operatingcosts for oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making manywells and/or oilfields uneconomical to operate.     The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, contains provisions specifying responsibility forremoval costs and damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters or onto theadjoining shorelines. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federalgovernment with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas productionsites.As a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations     We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries.In order to meet our financial needs, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principalon intercompany loans made by us to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and othercash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries willgenerate sufficient net income to pay upstream dividends or cash flow to make payments of interestand principal to us in respect of their intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, ouroperating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements which may contractually restrict orprohibit such upstream payments to us. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated withmaking dividend payments upstream.We do not currently intend to pay dividends     We have not paid any cash dividends on our common shares since 1982. Nabors does not currentlyintend to pay any cash dividends on its common shares. However, we can give no assurance that wewill not reevaluate our position on dividends in the future.Because our option, warrant and convertible securities holders have a considerable number of commonshares available for issuance and resale, significant issuances or resales in the future mayadversely affect the market price of our common shares11Table of Contents     As of February 23, 2009, we had 800,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 282,930,433shares were outstanding. In addition, 42,276,821 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuantto option and employee benefit plans, and 78,013,925 shares were reserved for issuance uponconversion or repurchase of outstanding senior exchangeable notes. In addition, up to 104,520 ofour common shares could be issuable on exchange of the shares of Nabors Exchangeco (Canada) Inc. Wealso plan to file a shelf registration statement to replace our shelf registration which expired inDecember 2008. The new shelf registration statement will automatically become effective on filingwith the SEC and will permit us to sell various types of securities from time to time. The sale,or availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whetherdirectly by us or resulting from the exercise of warrants or options (and, where applicable, salespursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act) or the conversion into common shares, or repurchase ofdebentures and notes using common shares, would be dilutive to existing security holders, couldadversely affect the prevailing market price of our common shares and could impair our ability toraise additional capital through the sale of equity securities.Provisions of our organizational documents and executive contracts may deter a change of controltransaction and decrease the likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium     Our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving a staggeredthree-year term. In addition, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue a significantamount of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares and to determine the price, rights(including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares,in each case without further vote or action by the holders of the common shares. Although we haveno present plans to issue preferred shares, the classified Board and our Boards ability to issueadditional preferred shares may discourage, delay or prevent changes in control of Nabors that arenot supported by our Board, thereby possibly preventing certain of our shareholders from realizinga possible premium on their shares. In addition, the requirement in the indenture for our $2.75billion senior exchangeable notes due 2011 to pay a make-whole premium in the form of an increasein the exchange rate in certain circumstances could have the effect of making a change in controlof Nabors more expensive.     The Company has existing employment contracts with Nabors Chairman and Chief ExecutiveOfficer, Eugene M. Isenberg, and its Deputy Chairman, President and Chief Operating Officer,Anthony G. Petrello. These employment contracts have Change of Control provisions that could resultin significant cash payments to Messrs. Isenberg and Petrello.We have a substantial amount of debt outstanding     As of December 31, 2008, we have long-term debt of approximately $4.1 billion, includingcurrent maturities of $225.0 million, and cash and cash equivalents and investments of $826.1million, including $240.0 million of long-term investments and other receivables. Long-terminvestments and other receivables include $224.2 million in oil and gas financing receivables. Ifour $2.75 billion 0.94% senior exchangeable notes are exchanged, the required cash payment couldhave a significant impact on our level of cash and cash equivalents and investments available tomeet our other cash obligations. We have a gross funded debt to capital ratio of 0.44:1 and a netfunded debt to capital ratio of 0.39:1. The gross funded debt to capital ratio is calculated bydividing funded debt by funded debt plus deferred tax liabilities net of deferred tax assets pluscapital. Funded debt is defined as the sum of (1) short-term borrowings, (2) current portion oflong-term debt and (3) long-term debt. Capital is defined as shareholders equity. The net fundeddebt to capital ratio is calculated by dividing net funded debt by net funded debt plus deferredtax liabilities net of deferred tax assets plus capital. Net funded debt is defined as the sum of(1) short-term borrowings, (2) current portion of long-term debt and (3) long-term debt reduced bythe sum of cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments. Capital is definedas shareholders equity. Both of these ratios are methods for calculating the amount of leverage acompany has in relation to its capital.     During January and through February 23, 2009, we purchased $427.7 million par value of our$2.75 billion 0.94% senior exchangeable notes due 2011 in the open market for cash totaling $370.6million, leaving $2.22 billion par value outstanding.     On January 12, 2009, Nabors Industries, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, (Nabors Delaware)issued $1.125 billion aggregate principal amount of 9.25% senior notes due 2019 that are fully andunconditionally guaranteed by Nabors Industries Ltd. See Note 22 Subsequent Event in Part II, Item8.  Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.     In January and through February 23, 2009 we repurchased $56.6 million par value of our $225million principal amount of 4.875% senior notes due August 2009 in the open market for cashtotaling $56.8 million.Our access to borrowing capacity could be affected by the recent instability in the globalfinancial markets     Our ability to access capital markets or to otherwise obtain sufficient financing is enhancedby our senior unsecured debt ratings as provided by Dominion Bond Rating Service (DBRS), FitchRatings, Moodys Investor Service and Standard & Poors, which are currently BBB+, BBB+, Baa1and BBB+ (Negative Watch), respectively, and our historical ability to access those markets as12Table of Contentsneeded. However, recent instability in the global financial markets has resulted in asignificant reduction in the availability of funds from capital markets and other credit marketsand as a result our ability to access these markets at this time may be significantly reduced. Inaddition, Standard & Poors recently affirmed its BBB+ credit rating on Nabors, but revised itsoutlook to negative from stable due primarily to worsening industry conditions. A credit downgradeby Standard & Poors may impact our future ability to access credit markets.Our ability to perform under new contracts and to grow our business as forecasted depends to asubstantial degree on timely delivery of rigs and equipment from our suppliers     The operating revenues and net income for our Contract Drilling subsidiaries depend to asubstantial degree on the timely delivery of rigs and equipment from our suppliers as part of ourrecently expanded capital programs. We can give no assurances that our suppliers will meet expecteddelivery schedules for delivery of these new rigs and equipment or that the new rigs and equipmentwill be free from defects. Delays in the delivery of new rigs and equipment and delays incurred incorrecting any defects in such rigs and equipment could cause us to fail to meet our operatingforecasts and could subject us to late delivery penalties under contracts with our customers.We may have additional tax liabilities     We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In theordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimatetax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although webelieve our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any relatedlitigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in income tax provisions andaccruals. Based on the results of an audit or litigation, a material effect on our financialposition, income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods for which thatdetermination is made could result.     It is possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties) could have an impacton our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings, resultingfrom our 2002 corporate reorganization.     On September 14, 2006, Nabors Drilling International Limited, one of our wholly owned Bermudasubsidiaries (NDIL), received a Notice of Assessment (the Notice) from the Mexican Servicio deAdministracion Tributaria (the SAT) in connection with the audit of NDILs Mexican branch for taxyear 2003. The Notice proposes to deny depreciation expense deductions relating to drilling rigs operating inMexico in 2003. The notice also proposes to deny a deduction for payments made to an affiliatedcompany for the procurement of labor services in Mexico. The amount assessed by the SAT wasapproximately $19.8 million (including interest and penalties). Nabors and its tax advisorspreviously concluded that the deduction of said amounts was appropriate and more recently that theposition of the SAT lacks merit. NDILs Mexican branch took similar deductions for depreciation andlabor expenses in 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. It is likely that the SAT will propose thedisallowance of these deductions upon audit of NDILs Mexican branchs 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007 and2008 tax years.Proposed tax legislation could mitigate or eliminate the benefits of our 2002 reorganization as aBermuda company     Various bills have been introduced in Congress which could reduce or eliminate the taxbenefits associated with our reorganization as a Bermuda company. Legislation enacted by Congressin 2004 provides that a corporation that reorganized in a foreign jurisdiction on or after March 4,2003 shall be treated as a domestic corporation for United States federal income tax purposes.Nabors reorganization was completed June 24, 2002. There have been and we expect that there maycontinue to be legislation proposed by Congress from time to time applicable to certain companiesthat completed such reorganizations on or after March 20, 2002 which, if enacted, could limit oreliminate the tax benefits associated with our reorganization.     Because we cannot predict whether legislation will ultimately be adopted, no assurance can begiven that the tax benefits associated with our reorganization will ultimately accrue to thebenefit of the Company and its shareholders. It is possible that future changes to the tax laws(including tax treaties) could have an impact on our ability to realize the tax savings recorded todate as well as future tax savings resulting from our reorganization.Legal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations     We are from time to time subject to legal proceedings or governmental investigations whichinclude employment, tort, intellectual property and other claims, and purported class action andshareholder derivative actions. We also are subject to complaints or allegations from former,current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations of employment-related laws.Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us which could have an adverse effect on ourfinancial condition or results of operations.13Table of ContentsOur financial results could be affected by changes in the value of our investment portfolio     We invest our excess cash in a variety of investment vehicles, many of which are subject tomarket fluctuations resulting from a variety of economic factors or factors associated with aparticular investment, including without limitation, overall declines in the equity markets,currency and interest rate fluctuations, volatility in the credit markets, exposures related toconcentrations of investments in a particular fund or investment, exposures related to hedges offinancial positions, and the performance of particular fund or investment managers. As a result,events or developments which negatively affect the value of our investments could have an adverseeffect on our results of operations.The loss of key executives could reduce our competitiveness and prospects for future success     The successful execution of our strategies central to our future success will depend, in part,on a few of our key executive officers. We have entered into employment agreements with ourChairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Eugene M. Isenberg and our Deputy Chairman, President andChief Operating Officer, Mr. Anthony G. Petrello, to secure their employment through September 30,2010. We do not carry key man insurance. The loss of Mr. Isenberg or Mr. Petrello could have anadverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations"

RISK FACTORS     In addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this Form 10-K, the followingfactors should be carefully considered when evaluating Nabors.Fluctuations in oil and gas prices could adversely affect drilling activity and our revenues, cashflows and profitability     Our operations are materially dependent upon the level of activity in oil and gas explorationand production. Both short-term and long-term trends in oil and gas prices affect the level ofsuch activity. Oil and gas prices and, therefore, the level of drilling, exploration andproduction activity can be volatile. Worldwide military, political and economic events, includinginitiatives by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, may affect both the demand for,and the supply of, oil and gas. Weather conditions, governmental regulation (both in the UnitedStates and elsewhere), levels of consumer demand, the availability of pipeline capacity, and otherfactors beyond our control may also affect the supply of and demand for oil and gas. We believethat any prolonged reduction in oil and gas prices would depress the level of exploration andproduction activity. This would likely result in a corresponding decline in the demand for ourservices and could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and profitability.Lower oil and gas prices could also cause our customers to seek to terminate, renegotiate or failto honor our drilling contracts; affect the fair market value of our rig fleet which in turn couldtrigger a write-down for accounting purposes; affect our ability to retain skilled rig personnel;and affect our ability to obtain access to capital to finance and grow our business. There can beno assurances as to the future level of demand for our services or future conditions in the oil andgas and oilfield services industries.We operate in a highly competitive industry with excess drilling capacity, which may adverselyaffect our results of operations     The oilfield services industry in which we operate is very competitive. Contract drillingcompanies compete primarily on a regional basis, and competition may vary significantly from regionto region at any particular time. Many drilling, workover and well-servicing rigs can be movedfrom one region to another in response to changes in levels of activity and provided marketconditions warrant, which may result in an oversupply of rigs in an area. In many markets in whichwe operate, the number of rigs available for use exceeds the demand for rigs, resulting in pricecompetition. Most drilling and workover contracts are awarded on the basis of competitive bids,which also results in price competition. The land drilling market generally is more competitivethan the offshore drilling market because there are larger numbers of rigs and competitors.The nature of our operations presents inherent risks of loss that, if not insured or indemnifiedagainst, could adversely affect our results of operations     Our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the drilling, workover andwell-servicing industries, including blowouts, cratering, explosions, fires, loss of well control,loss of hole, damaged or lost drilling equipment and damage or loss from inclement weather ornatural disasters. Any of these hazards could result in personal injury or death, damage to ordestruction of equipment and facilities, suspension of operations, environmental damage and damageto the property of others. Our offshore operations are also subject to the hazards of marineoperations including capsizing, grounding, collision, damage from hurricanes and heavy weather orsea conditions and unsound ocean bottom conditions. In addition, our international operations aresubject to risks of war, civil disturbances or other political events. Generally, drillingcontracts provide for the division of responsibilities between a drilling company and its customer,and we seek to obtain indemnification from our customers by contract for certain of these risks.To the extent that we are unable to transfer such risks to customers by contract or indemnificationagreements, we seek protection through insurance. However, there is7Table of Contentsno assurance that such insurance or indemnification agreements will adequately protect us againstliability from all of the consequences of the hazards described above. The occurrence of an eventnot fully insured or indemnified against, or the failure of a customer or insurer to meet itsindemnification or insurance obligations, could result in substantial losses. In addition, therecan be no assurance that insurance will be available to cover any or all of these risks, or, evenif available, that it will be adequate or that insurance premiums or other costs will not risesignificantly in the future, so as to make such insurance prohibitive. It is likely that we willface continued upward pressure in our upcoming insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibleswill be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or more expensive than ithas been in the past. Moreover, our insurance coverage generally provides that we assume a portionof the risk in the form of an insurance coverage deductible. We expect that we may choose toincrease the levels of deductibles (and thus assume a greater degree of risk) from time to time inorder to minimize the effect of insurance premium increases.The profitability of our international operations could be adversely affected by war, civildisturbance or political or economic turmoil     We derive a significant portion of our business from international markets, including majoroperations in Canada, the Middle East, the Far East and South and Central America. Theseoperations are subject to various risks, including the risk of war, civil disturbances andgovernmental activities that may limit or disrupt markets, restrict the movement of funds or resultin the deprivation of contract rights or the taking of property without fair compensation. Incertain countries, our operations may be subject to the additional risk of fluctuating currencyvalues and exchange controls. In the international markets in which we operate, we are subject tovarious laws and regulations that govern the operation and taxation of our business and the importand export of our equipment from country to country, the imposition, application and interpretationof which can prove to be uncertain.Changes to or noncompliance with governmental regulation or exposure to environmental liabilitiescould adversely affect our results of operations     The drilling of oil and gas wells is subject to various federal, state, local and foreignlaws, rules and regulations. Our cost of compliance with these laws and regulations may besubstantial. For example, federal law imposes a variety of regulations on responsible partiesrelated to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages from such spills. As an ownerand operator of onshore and offshore rigs and transportation equipment, we may be deemed to be aresponsible party under federal law. In addition, our well-servicing, workover and productionservices operations routinely involve the handling of significant amounts of waste materials, someof which are classified as hazardous substances. Our operations and facilities are subject tonumerous state and federal environmental laws, rules and regulations, including, withoutlimitation, laws concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous substances, oilfield wasteand other waste materials, the use of underground storage tanks and the use of undergroundinjection wells. We generally require customers to contractually assume responsibility forcompliance with environmental regulations. However, we are not always successful in allocating tocustomers all of these risks nor is there any assurance that the customer will be financially ableto bear those risks assumed.     We employ personnel responsible for monitoring environmental compliance and arranging forremedial actions that may be required from time to time and also use outside experts to advise onand assist with our environmental compliance efforts. Liabilities are recorded when the need forenvironmental assessments and/or remedial efforts become known or probable and the cost can bereasonably estimated.     Laws protecting the environment generally have become more stringent than in the past and areexpected to continue to become more so. Violation of environmental laws and regulations can leadto the imposition of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, remedial obligations, and in somecases injunctive relief. Such violations could also result in liabilities for personal injuries,property damage, and other costs and claims.     Under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, also known asCERCLA or Superfund, and related state laws and regulations, liability can be imposed jointly onthe entire group of responsible parties or separately on any one of the responsible parties,without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons thatcontributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. Under CERCLA, suchpersons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been releasedinto the environment and for damages to natural resources.     Changes in federal and state environmental regulations may also negatively impact oil andnatural gas exploration and production companies, which in turn could have a material adverseeffect on us. For example, legislation has been proposed from time to time in Congress which wouldreclassify certain oil and natural gas production wastes as hazardous8Table of Contentswastes, which would make the reclassified wastes subject to more stringent handling, disposal andclean-up requirements. If enacted, such legislation could dramatically increase operating costsfor oil and natural gas companies and could reduce the market for our services by making many wellsand/or oilfields uneconomical to operate.     The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended, contains provisions specifying responsibility forremoval costs and damages resulting from discharges of oil into navigable waters or onto theadjoining shorelines. In addition, the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act provides the federalgovernment with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore oil and gas productionsites. Because our offshore support vessel operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration andproduction, if the government were to exercise its authority under this law to restrict theavailability of offshore oil and gas leases, such an action could have a material adverse effect onour offshore support vessel operations.Recent Legislation could curtail our ability to time charter vessels in U.S. coastwise trade     Our Sea Mar division time charters supply vessels to offshore operators in U.S. waters. Thevessels are owned by one of our financing company subsidiaries, but are operated and managed by aU.S. citizen-controlled company pursuant to long-term bareboat charters. As a result of recentlegislation, beginning in August 2007 Sea Mar will no longer be able to use this arrangement toqualify vessels for employment in the U.S. coastwise trade. Accordingly, we will be required torestructure the arrangement, redeploy the vessels outside the United States, or sell the vessels byno later than such time.     As of December 31, 2005, the net assets of Sea Mar totaled approximately $151 million. During2005 Sea Mar had income before income taxes totaling $17 million.As a holding company, we depend on our subsidiaries to meet our financial obligations     We are a holding company with no significant assets other than the stock of our subsidiaries.In order to meet our financial needs, we rely exclusively on repayments of interest and principalon intercompany loans made by us to our operating subsidiaries and income from dividends and othercash flow from such subsidiaries. There can be no assurance that our operating subsidiaries willgenerate sufficient net income to pay upstream dividends or cash flow to make payments of interestand principal to us in respect of their intercompany loans. In addition, from time to time, ouroperating subsidiaries may enter into financing arrangements which may contractually restrict orprohibit such upstream payments to us. There may also be adverse tax consequences associated withmaking dividend payments upstream.We do not currently intend to pay dividends     We have not paid any cash dividends on our common shares since 1982. Nabors does notcurrently intend to pay any cash dividends on its common shares. However, we note that there havebeen recent positive industry trends and changes in tax law providing more favorable treatment ofdividends. As a result, we can give no assurance that we will not reevaluate our position ondividends in the future.Because our option, warrant and convertible securities holders have a considerable number of commonshares available for issuance and resale, significant issuances or resales in the future mayadversely affect the market price of our common shares     As of February 24, 2006, we had 400,000,000 authorized common shares, of which 156,556,748shares were outstanding. In addition, 21,587,691 common shares were reserved for issuance pursuantto option and employee benefit plans, and 10,571,231 shares were reserved for issuance uponconversion or repurchase of outstanding zero coupon convertible debentures and zero coupon seniorexchangeable notes. In addition, up to 107,603 of our common shares could be issuable on exchangeof the shares of Nabors Exchangeco (Canada) Inc. We also may sell up to $700 million of securitiesof various types in connection with a shelf registration statement declared effective on January16, 2003 by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The sale, or availability for sale, ofsubstantial amounts of our common shares in the public market, whether directly by us or resultingfrom the exercise of warrants or options (and, where applicable, sales pursuant to Rule 144) or theconversion into common shares, or repurchase of debentures and notes using common shares, would bedilutive to existing security holders, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of ourcommon shares and could impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equitysecurities.     We will hold a Special Meeting of Shareholders on March 30, 2006 to approve the proposal toamend our Amended and Restated Bye-Laws to increase our authorized share capital by the creation ofadditional common shares. The additional shares will accommodate a two-for-one stock split (to beeffected in the form of a stock dividend), which has been approved9Table of Contentsby our Board of Directors, subject to shareholder approval of the increase in the number ofauthorized shares. If this proposal is approved, our authorized common shares will increase to800,000,000.Provisions of our organizational documents may deter a change of control transaction and decreasethe likelihood of a shareholder receiving a change of control premium     Our board of directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving a staggeredthree-year term. In addition, our board of directors has the authority to issue a significantamount of common shares and up to 25,000,000 preferred shares and to determine the price, rights(including voting rights), conversion ratios, preferences and privileges of the preferred shares,in each case without further vote or action by the holders of the common shares. Although we haveno present plans to issue preferred shares, the classified board and our boards ability to issueadditional preferred shares may discourage, delay or prevent changes in control of Nabors that arenot supported by our board, thereby possibly preventing certain of our shareholders from realizinga possible premium on their shares. In addition, the requirement in the indenture for Series B ofour $700 million zero coupon senior exchangeable notes due 2023 to pay a make-whole premium in theform of an increase in the exchange rate in certain circumstances could have the effect of making achange in control of Nabors more expensive.We have a substantial amount of debt outstanding     We had approximately $2.0 billion in debt outstanding as of December 31, 2005, resulting in afunded debt to capital ratio of 0.35:1 and a net funded debt to capital ratio of 0.9:1. Both ofthese ratios are a method for calculating the amount of leverage a company has in relation to itscapital. On February 6, 2006, we redeemed 93% of our zero coupon senior convertible debentures due2021 for a total redemption price of $769.8 million. Subsequent to this redemption, we hadapproximately $1.2 billion in debt outstanding, resulting in a funded debt to capital ratio of0.25:1 and a net funded debt to capital ratio, which remained unchanged at 0.9:1.Our ability to perform under new contracts and to grow our business as forecasted depends to asubstantial degree on timely delivery of rigs and equipment from our suppliers     The forecasted growth in the operating revenues and net income for our Contract Drillingsubsidiaries depends to a substantial degree on the timely delivery of rigs and equipment from oursuppliers as part of our recently expanded capital programs. We can give no assurances that oursuppliers will meet expected delivery schedules for delivery of these new rigs and equipment.Delays in the delivery of new rigs and equipment could cause us to fail to meet our operatingforecasts and could subject us to late delivery penalties under contracts with our customers.We may have additional tax liabilities     We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In theordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimatetax determination is uncertain. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities. Although webelieve our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any relatedlitigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income taxprovisions and accruals. Based on the results of an audit or litigation, a material effect on ourfinancial position, income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period or periods forwhich that determination is made could result.     It is possible that future changes to tax laws (including tax treaties) could have an impacton our ability to realize the tax savings recorded to date as well as future tax savings as aresult of our corporate reorganization, depending on any responsive action taken by us.Legal proceedings could affect our financial condition and results of operations     We are from time to time subject to legal proceedings which include employment, tort,intellectual property and other claims. We also are subject to complaints or allegations fromformer, current or prospective employees from time to time, alleging violations ofemployment-related laws. Lawsuits or claims could result in decisions against us which could havea material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations"
