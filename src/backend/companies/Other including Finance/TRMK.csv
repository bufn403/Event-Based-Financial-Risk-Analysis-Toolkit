9,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2024-02-15,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This 16 section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below. Risks Related to Trustmark’s BusinessInterest Rate RisksTrustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  Market interest rates began to rise during 2022 after an extended period at historical lows.  Starting in March 2022, the FRB began raising the target federal funds rate for the first time in three years and continued with multiple increases throughout 2022 and 2023, up to a range of 5.25% to 5.50% as of December 2023.  In addition, the FRB increased the interest that it pays on reserves multiple times during 2022 and 2023 from 0.10% to 5.40% as of December 2023.  As interest rates have increased, so have competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  This has been exacerbated by the bank failures in the first half of 2023 and the resulting heightened competition for deposits, which has also affected the interest that Trustmark pays on deposits.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes in interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark's results of operations.Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2023, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may increase 0.5%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may increase net interest income 0.3%.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2023, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 0.4%, while a hypothetical 200 basis point decrease in interest rates, may decrease net interest income 1.0%.Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark’s interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below:•In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.•The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.17 Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark may be adversely affected by the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate.In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that after the end of 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR.  On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that the publication of most LIBOR term rates would end on June 30, 2023 (excluding one-week U.S. LIBOR and two-month U.S. LIBOR, the publication of which ended on December 31, 2021).  The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a committee of U.S. financial market participants, identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the reference rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR.  However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR.  The federal banking agencies encouraged banking organizations to cease entering into new contracts that use US$ LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and to ensure existing contracts have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate. On December 16, 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implemented the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023.  Following the LIBOR cessation date of June 30, 2023, the nationwide process for replacing LIBOR in financial contracts that mature thereafter and that do not provide for an effective means to replace LIBOR upon its cessation took effect pursuant to the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act.  For contracts in which a party has the discretion to identify a replacement rate, the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act also provides a safe harbor to parties if they choose the SOFR-based benchmark replacement rate to be identified by the FRB.  Trustmark transitioned to SOFR for new variable rate loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments as of January 1, 2022.Trustmark had a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that were either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.  As of December 31, 2023, all of Trustmark’s LIBOR exposure was remediated or in the process of being remediated.  The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk.  Since alternative reference rates are calculated differently than LIBOR, payments under contracts referencing new alternative reference rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR.  Trustmark cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be; however, Trustmark has implemented various measures to manage the transition and mitigate risks.Credit and Lending RisksTrustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert to or decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required, to make further increases in its provision for credit losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Additionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.  This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and 18 other information.  Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.A significant portion of Trustmark’s loan portfolio is secured by real property.  During the ordinary course of business, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to properties securing certain loans.  In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties.  If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Trustmark may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property.  Environmental laws may require Trustmark to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit Trustmark’s ability to use or ability to sell the affected property or to repay the indebtedness secured by the property.  In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase Trustmark’s exposure to environmental liability.  Environmental reviews of nonresidential real estate before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards.  The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Declines in asset values may result in credit losses and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for expected credit losses.  At December 31, 2023, gross unrealized losses on securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded totaled $196.1 million.  Trustmark may be required to record credit loss expense if these investments suffer a decline in value that is the result of a credit loss.  If Trustmark determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance would be measured using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security’s purchase date.  The amount of credit loss Trustmark may record is limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a credit loss, if any, occurs.Liquidity RiskTrustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.19 External and Market-Related RisksTrustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.Economic activity improved slightly during 2023; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of uncertainty regarding the potential economic impact of geopolitical developments, such as the conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, inflation, the consequences of bank failures and other economic and industry volatility, the 2024 political cycle in the United States, supply chain issues, higher energy prices and broader price pressures.  Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term.  While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising rates and modest economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.Market interest rates began to rise during 2022 after an extended period at historical lows and continued to rise in 2023.  As interest rates have increased, so have competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  This has been exacerbated by bank failures and the resulting heightened competition for deposits, which has also affected the interest that Trustmark pays on deposits.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events:•Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for credit losses.•Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.•Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch.The rising interest rate environment during 2022 and 2023, the resulting industry-wide reduction in the fair value of securities portfolios and the bank runs that led to the failures of some financial institutions in March 2023, among other events, have resulted in a current state of volatility and uncertainty with respect to the health of the United States banking system.  There is heightened awareness around liquidity, uninsured deposits, deposit composition, unrecognized investment losses and capital.  It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able to successfully mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include banks, as well as community banks operating nationwide and regionally within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  Additionally, fintech developments, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.20 Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Compliance and Regulatory RisksTrustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes.  Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, continue to pursue enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions.  The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations.  A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s performance under fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of direct or indirect negative consequences, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on geographic expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines.  Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.  Such actions could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  In 2021, TNB settled a fair lending enforcement action with the Department of Justice, the OCC and the CFPB and incurred a one-time settlement expense of $5.0 million and made other commitments to enhance credit opportunities to residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis metropolitan statistical area.  Trustmark and TNB could be subject to other enforcement actions in the future.In addition, financial institutions face scrutiny on actions and policies that are deemed to adversely impact consumers under the Dodd-Frank Act’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act’s 21 prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts and practices.  Bank regulators and the CFPB are responsible for enforcing these prohibitions against banking organizations.  These prohibitions have been applied to prohibit perceived customer abuse in connection with a range of products, services, and practices, including account openings and fees charged where inadequate or no services are rendered for which charges were imposed, as well as other instances where consumers may have been misled through bank disclosures.  In addition, the enforcement priorities of the agencies enforcing consumer protection laws have evolved over time and may continue to do so.TNB's CRA rating of ""Needs to Improve"" could make it more difficult for Trustmark’s business to grow.The performance of a bank under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of its community is a factor that must be taken into consideration when the federal banking agencies evaluate applications related to mergers and acquisitions, as well as branch opening and relocations.   As of its last examination, TNB received a CRA rating of “Needs to Improve,” which is downgraded from its prior rating of “Satisfactory.”  The rating of “Needs to Improve” adversely affects TNB’s ability to obtain regulatory approvals to engage in certain expansionary activities, including certain mergers and acquisitions and the establishment of bank branches.  These limitations will remain in place until TNB receives a CRA rating of at least “Satisfactory” following a subsequent CRA examination.  The precise timing of the completion of that examination and any results therefrom will not be known until later, and it is possible that TNB’s current CRA rating would not improve in the next examination.Trustmark is subject to stringent capital requirements.Under the regulatory capital rules of the FRB, OCC, and FDIC that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III, Trustmark and TNB are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of at least 4.0%.  In addition, for TNB to be “well-capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.The capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules, but this grandfather provision may cease to apply if Trustmark consummates an acquisition of a depository institution holding company and the resulting organization has $15 billion of more in total assets.Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 326, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” requires Trustmark to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  FASB ASC Topic 326 generally is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses, which would increase reserves and decrease capital.  Additionally, the allowance for credit losses model could be materially impacted by changes in current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions.  It is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of changes in macroeconomic conditions or the impact such changes could have on Trustmark’s allowance for credit losses; however, material changes in the allowance for credit losses could have a material impact on Trustmark’s reserves and capital.The regulatory capital rules applicable to Trustmark and TNB may continue to evolve as a result of new requirements established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or legislative, regulatory or accounting changes in the United States.  Management cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on Trustmark and TNB.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC.  Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  These regulatory expectations may change, and potentially become more rigorous in certain ways, due to an interagency effort to replace existing guidance on the risk management of third-party 22 relationships with new guidance.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.Operational RisksThere may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on statistical and quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining expected credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Also, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.If Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price would generally be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2023, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $387.2 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2023 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.Trustmark holds other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2023, Trustmark held $6.9 million of other real estate.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.23 If Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Representations and Warranties Framework, which provides that FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties if the mortgage loans satisfy certain criteria, such as payment history or quality control review.Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Trustmark’s investments in premises, equipment, technology and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.Trustmark has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network.  Advances in technology such as ecommerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including interactive teller machines (ITMs) and other equipment, as well as an increasing customer preference for these other methods of accessing Trustmark’s products and services, could decrease the value of its branch network, technology, or other retail distribution physical assets and may cause Trustmark to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force.  These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of any long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate, reconfigure or close a number of Trustmark’s remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in significant disruption to Trustmark's operations.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark’s control.  There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts. Further, Trustmark’s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches and cybersecurity-related incidents including, but not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, theft, misuse, loss, release or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Any failures related to upgrades and maintenance of Trustmark's technology and information systems could further increase its information and system security risk.  Trustmark's increased use of cloud and other technologies, such as remote work technologies, also increases its risk of being subject to a cyber-attack.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.  Trustmark may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmark®) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the 24 security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Trustmark has seen no material adverse impact on its business or operations from cyber-attacks or events.  Trustmark's customers, employees and third parties that it does business with have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware programs to its information systems, the information systems of its merchants or third-party service providers and/or its customers' personal devices, which are beyond Trustmark's security control systems. Though Trustmark endeavors to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology and customer and employee education, such cyber-attacks against Trustmark, its merchants, third-party service providers and customers remain a serious issue and have been successful in the past.Although Trustmark makes significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of its information systems and has implemented various measures to manage the risks of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that its security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable to attempted security breaches or disruptions because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, Trustmark may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for Trustmark to entirely mitigate this risk.  Furthermore, in the event of a cyber-attack, Trustmark may be delayed in identifying or responding to the attack, which could increase the negative impact of the cyber-attack on its business, financial condition and results of operations.  A security breach or other significant disruption of Trustmark's information systems or those related to its customers, merchants or third-party vendors, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could (i) disrupt the proper functioning of its networks and systems and therefore its operations and/or those of its customers; (ii) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of Trustmark or its customers; (iii) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting Trustmark to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing it to civil litigation, enforcement actions, governmental fines and possible financial liability; (iv) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or (v) harm Trustmark's reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with Trustmark.  The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark's business, financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark continues to invest in technology to facilitate the ability of its customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to its products and services.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.Trustmark’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.25 Trustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.Trustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities.  Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”  Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.Substantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to its reputation.  TNB recently agreed to settlements relating to litigation involving the Stanford Financial Group and Adams/Madison Timber.  For additional information regarding these settlements, see the section captioned “Legal Proceedings” in Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Damage to Trustmark’s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Trustmark’s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation.  Significant harm to Trustmark’s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical or illegal behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark’s reputation.  Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.  Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients.  The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s businesses.Risk Related to Acquisition ActivityPotential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark continuously monitors the market for merger or acquisition opportunities and, depending upon business and other considerations, may elect to pursue one or more such opportunities in the future.  Any such merger or acquisition candidate would need to have a similar culture to Trustmark, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark’s business, potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction.  Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.General Risk Factors
The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole, such as the bank failures in March 2023.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include:•actual or anticipated variations in earnings;•changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;•operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;26 •perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole;•significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;•provisions in Trustmark’s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser;•changes in government regulation;•failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and•volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.  For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Trustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.Trustmark’s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel.  Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense.  While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and development of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees.  If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Expectations around Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) practices as well as climate change and related legislative and regulatory initiatives could adversely affect Trustmark’s business and results of operations, including indirectly through impact to its customers.Companies are facing increased scrutiny from customers, regulators and other stakeholders with respect to their ESG practices and disclosures. Institutional investors, and investor advocacy groups, in particular, are increasingly focused on these matters and expectations in many of these areas can vary widely.  In addition, increased ESG related compliance costs could result in increases to Trustmark’s overall operational costs.  Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, and fluctuations in these standards, could negatively impact Trustmark’s reputation, ability to do business with certain partners and its stock price.  New government regulations could also result in new or more stringent forms of ESG oversight and expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure.In addition to regulatory and investor expectations on environmental matters in general, the current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment.  As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased.  In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Congress, state legislatures and 27 federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change.  These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require businesses to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. It is not possible to predict how climate change may impact Trustmark’s financial condition and operations; however, Trustmark operates in areas where its business and the activities of its customers could be impacted by the effects of climate change.  The effects of climate change may include increased frequency or severity of weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts and rising sea levels.  These effects can disrupt business operations, damage property, devalue assets and change customer and business preferences, which may adversely affect borrowers, increase credit risk and reduce demand for Trustmark’s products and services.  Trustmark and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns.  Trustmark and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes and the like.  The impact to Trustmark’s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities.  In addition, Trustmark could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans.  Trustmark’s efforts to take these risks into account may not be effective in protecting it from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior and could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations"
11,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2023-02-16,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below. Risks Related to Trustmark’s BusinessInterest Rate RisksTrustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  Market interest rates began to rise during 2022 after an extended period at historical lows. Starting in March 2022, the FRB began raising the target federal funds rate for the first time in three years and continued with multiple increases throughout 2022, up to a range of 4.25% to 4.50% as of December 2022.  The FRB also signaled the possibility of additional rate increases throughout 2023.  In addition, the FRB increased the interest that it pays on reserves multiple times during 2022 from 0.10% to 4.40% as of December 2022.  The prolonged period of reduced interest rates has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on net interest income and margins and profitability for financial institutions, including Trustmark.  Additionally, as interest rates have increased, so have competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes in interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark's results of operations.Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2022, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may increase 3.3%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may increase net 16 interest income 1.7%.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2022, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 1.8%.Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark’s interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below:•In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.•The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark may be adversely affected by the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate.In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that after the end of 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR.  On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that the publication of most LIBOR term rates will end on June 30, 2023 (excluding one-week U.S. LIBOR and two-month U.S. LIBOR, the publication of which ended on December 31, 2021).  The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a committee of U.S. financial market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the reference rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR.  However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR.  The federal banking agencies encouraged banking organizations to cease entering into new contracts that use US$ LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and to ensure existing contracts have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate.  Market participants are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.  On December 16, 2022, the FRB adopted a final rule that implements the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by identifying benchmark rates based on SOFR that will replace LIBOR in certain financial contracts after June 30, 2023.  While the benchmark provider for US$ LIBOR (which was typically the benchmark that Trustmark used) intends to provide the benchmark for some tenors of US$ LIBOR through June 2023, Trustmark has transitioned to SOFR for new variable rate loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments as of January 1, 2022.17 Trustmark has a significant number of existing loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.  The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk.  Since alternative reference rates are calculated differently than LIBOR, payments under contracts referencing new alternative reference rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR.  The transition has changed and will continue to change, Trustmark’s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies.  Trustmark cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be; however, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation with its customers.Credit and Lending RisksTrustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, if trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required, to make further increases in its provision for credit losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Additionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.  This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and other information.  Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.A significant portion of Trustmark’s loan portfolio is secured by real property.  During the ordinary course of business, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to properties securing certain loans.  In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties.  If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Trustmark may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property.  Environmental laws may require Trustmark to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit Trustmark’s ability to use or ability to sell the affected property or to repay the indebtedness secured by the property.  In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase Trustmark’s exposure to environmental liability.  Environmental reviews of nonresidential real estate before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards.  The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Declines in asset values may result in credit losses and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for expected credit losses.  At December 31, 2022, gross unrealized losses on securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded totaled $335.0 million.  Trustmark may be required to record credit loss expense if these investments suffer a decline in value that is the result of a credit loss.  If Trustmark determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance would be measured using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security’s purchase date.  The amount of credit loss Trustmark may record is limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a credit loss, if any, occurs.18 Liquidity RiskTrustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.External and Market-Related RisksTrustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.Economic activity continued to improve during 2022 as COVID-19 cases declined across the United States and restrictions were lifted; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of uncertainty regarding the long-term effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine and the potential economic impact of recent geopolitical developments, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  Inflation has become elevated, reflecting supply and demand imbalances related to the pandemic, supply chain issues, higher energy prices and broader price pressures.  Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term.  While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising rates and modest economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.Market interest rates rose during 2022 after an extended period at historical lows.  The prolonged period of reduced interest rates in recent years, has and may continue to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors).  Conversely, as  interest rates rise, so do competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events:•Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for credit losses.•Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.•Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge 19 to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch.It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include banks, as well as community banks operating nationwide and regionally within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  Additionally, fintech developments, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Compliance and Regulatory RisksTrustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes.  Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, continue to pursue enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks 20 associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions.  The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations.  A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s performance under fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of direct or indirect negative consequences, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on geographic expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines.  Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.  Such actions could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  In 2021, TNB settled a fair lending enforcement action with the Department of Justice, the OCC and the CFPB and incurred a one-time settlement expense of $5.0 million and made other commitments to enhance credit opportunities to residents of majority-Black and Hispanic neighborhoods in the Memphis metropolitan statistical area.  Trustmark and TNB could be subject to other enforcement actions in the future.In addition, financial institutions face scrutiny on actions and policies that are deemed to adversely impact consumers under the Dodd-Frank Act’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act’s prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts and practices.  Bank regulators and the CFPB are responsible for enforcing these prohibitions against banking organizations.  These prohibitions have been applied to prohibit perceived customer abuse in connection with a range of products, services, and practices, including account openings and fees charged where inadequate or no services are rendered for which charges were imposed, as well as other instances where consumers may have been misled through bank disclosures.  In addition, the enforcement priorities of the agencies enforcing consumer protection laws have evolved over time and may continue to do so.Failure by Trustmark to perform satisfactorily on its CRA evaluations could make it more difficult for Trustmark’s business to grow.The performance of a bank under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of its community is a factor that must be taken into consideration when the federal banking agencies evaluate applications related to mergers and acquisitions, as well as branch opening and relocations.  If TNB is unable to maintain at least a “Satisfactory” CRA rating, its ability to complete the acquisition of another financial institution or open a new branch will be adversely impacted.  If TNB received an overall CRA rating of less than “Satisfactory,” the FDIC would not re-evaluate its rating until its next CRA examination, which may not occur for several more years, and it is possible that a low CRA rating would not improve in the future.  As of its last examination, TNB received a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.”Trustmark is subject to stringent capital requirements.Under the regulatory capital rules of the FRB, OCC, and FDIC that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III, Trustmark and TNB are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of at least 4.0%.  In addition, for TNB to be “well-capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.The capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules, but this grandfather provision may cease to apply if Trustmark consummates an acquisition of a depository institution holding company and the resulting organization has $15 billion of more in total assets.Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 326, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” requires Trustmark to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  FASB ASC Topic 326 generally is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses, which would increase reserves and decrease capital.  Additionally, the allowance for credit losses model could be materially impacted by changes in current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions.  It is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of changes in macroeconomic conditions or the impact such changes could have on 21 Trustmark’s allowance for credit losses; however, material changes in the allowance for credit losses could have a material impact on Trustmark’s reserves and capital.The regulatory capital rules applicable to Trustmark and TNB may continue to evolve as a result of new requirements established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or legislative, regulatory or accounting changes in the United States.  Management cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on Trustmark and TNB.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC.  Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  These regulatory expectations may change, and potentially become more rigorous in certain ways, due to an interagency effort to replace existing guidance on the risk management of third-party relationships with new guidance.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.Operational RisksThere may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on statistical and quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining expected credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Also, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.If Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price would generally be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2022, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $387.9 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2022 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.22 Trustmark holds other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2022, Trustmark held $2.0 million of other real estate, compared to $4.6 million at December 31, 2021.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Representations and Warranties Framework, which provides that FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties if the mortgage loans satisfy certain criteria, such as payment history or quality control review.Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Trustmark’s investments in premises, equipment, technology and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.Trustmark has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network.  Advances in technology such as ecommerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including interactive teller machines (ITMs) and other equipment, as well as an increasing customer preference for these other methods of accessing Trustmark’s products and services, could decrease the value of its branch network, technology, or other retail distribution physical assets and may cause Trustmark to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force.  These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of any long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate, reconfigure or close a number of Trustmark’s remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark’s control.  There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts.  Further, Trustmark’s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Trustmark may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely 23 affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmark®) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark continues to invest in technology to facilitate the ability of its customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to its products and services.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.Trustmark’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.Trustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities.  Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”  Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.Substantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to its reputation.  TNB recently agreed to a settlement relating to litigation involving the Stanford Financial Group.  For additional information regarding this settlement, see the section captioned “Legal Proceedings” in Note 16 - Commitments and Contingencies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Damage to Trustmark’s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Trustmark’s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation.  Public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the economic downturn and related government response.  Trustmark faces increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn.  Significant harm to Trustmark’s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived 24 unethical or illegal behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark’s reputation.  Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.  Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients.  The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s businesses.Risk Related to Acquisition ActivityPotential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark continuously monitors the market for merger or acquisition opportunities and, depending upon business and other considerations, may elect to pursue one or more such opportunities in the future.  Any such merger or acquisition candidate would need to have a similar culture to Trustmark, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark’s business, potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction.  Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.General Risk Factors
The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include:•actual or anticipated variations in earnings;•changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;•operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;•perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole;•significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;•provisions in Trustmark’s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser;•changes in government regulation;•failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and•volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of 25 Trustmark’s financial statements.  The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.  For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Trustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.Trustmark’s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel.  Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense.  While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and development of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees.  If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Climate change and societal responses to climate change could adversely affect Trustmark’s business and results of operations, including indirectly through impact to its customers.The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment.  As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased.  In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change.  These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require businesses to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. It is not possible to predict how climate change may impact Trustmark’s financial condition and operations; however, Trustmark operates in areas where its business and the activities of its customers could be impacted by the effects of climate change.  The effects of climate change may include increased frequency or severity of weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts and rising sea levels.  These effects can disrupt business operations, damage property, devalue assets and change customer and business preferences, which may adversely affect borrowers, increase credit risk and reduce demand for Trustmark’s products and services.  Trustmark and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns.  Trustmark and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes and the like.  The impact to Trustmark’s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities.  In addition, Trustmark could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans.  Trustmark’s efforts to take these risks into account may not be effective in protecting it from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior and could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations"
8,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2022-02-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below. Risks Related to Trustmark’s BusinessInterest Rate RisksTrustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of actions by the FRB.  Market interest rates have declined to historical lows.  During 2020, the ten-year Treasury yield fell below 1.00% for the first time, and the FRB reduced the target federal funds rate to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The FRB reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves from 1.60% to 0.10% during the first quarter of 2020.  These rates continued through 2021, although the FRB has announced its intent to increase rates and wind down securities purchases commencing in March 2022.  The prolonged period of low interest rates has had an adverse effect on net interest income and margins and profitability for financial institutions, including Trustmark. Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2021, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may increase 20.1%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may increase net interest income 9.7%.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2021, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 6.7%.17 Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark’s interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below:•In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.•The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark may be adversely affected by the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate.In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates LIBOR, announced that after the end of 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR.  On March 5, 2021, the FCA confirmed that the publication of most LIBOR term rates will end on June 30, 2023 (excluding one-week U.S. LIBOR and two-month U.S. LIBOR, the publication of which ended on December 31, 2021).  The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a committee of U.S. financial market participants, has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the reference rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR.  However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR.  The federal banking agencies have encouraged banking organizations to cease entering into new contracts that use US$ LIBOR as a reference rate by no later than December 31, 2021, and to ensure existing contracts have robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate.  Market participants are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.  While the benchmark provider for US$ LIBOR (which was typically the benchmark that Trustmark used) intends to provide the benchmark for some tenors of US$ LIBOR through June 2023, Trustmark has transitioned to SOFR for new variable rate loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments as of January 1, 2022.Trustmark has a significant number of existing loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.  The transition from LIBOR has resulted in and could continue to result in added costs and employee efforts and could present additional risk.  Since alternative reference rates are calculated differently than LIBOR, payments under contracts referencing new alternative reference rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR.  The transition has changed and will continue to change, Trustmark’s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies.  Trustmark cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be; 18 however, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation with its customers.Credit and Lending RisksTrustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, if trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required, to make further increases in its provision for credit losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Additionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.  This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and other information.  Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities.A significant portion of Trustmark’s loan portfolio is secured by real property.  During the ordinary course of business, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to properties securing certain loans.  In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties.  If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Trustmark may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property.  Environmental laws may require Trustmark to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit Trustmark’s ability to use or ability to sell the affected property or to repay the indebtedness secured by the property.  In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase Trustmark’s exposure to environmental liability.  Environmental reviews of nonresidential real estate before initiating foreclosure actions may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards.  The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Declines in asset values may result in credit losses and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for expected credit losses.  At December 31, 2021, gross unrealized losses on securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded totaled $31.0 million.  Trustmark may be required to record credit loss expense if these investments suffer a decline in value that is the result of a credit loss.  If Trustmark determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance would be measured using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security’s purchase date.  The amount of credit loss Trustmark may record is limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a credit loss, if any, occurs.Liquidity RiskTrustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes. 19 Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.External and Market-Related RisksTrustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.The COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to mitigate the spread of it have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on economic activity globally, nationally and locally, including the geographical area in which Trustmark operates and industries in which Trustmark regularly extends credit.  Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term.  While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. While domestic demand for loans has improved, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising rates and modest economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.Interest rates remain within a historically low level that, when combined with the extended period of lower interest rates in recent years, continue to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors).  Conversely, increases in interest rates will place competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events:•Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for credit losses.•Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.•Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch.•At December 31, 2021, energy-related LHFI represented approximately 1.1% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio and consisted principally of loans within the oilfield services and midstream segments.  Additionally, at December 31, 2021, less than 1 basis point of Trustmark’s energy-related LHFI were classified as nonaccrual.  Trustmark has no loan exposure where the source of repayment, or the underlying security of such exposure, is tied to the realization of value from energy 20 reserves.  Nonetheless, if oil prices fall to levels that compromise the financial condition of market participants generally, or of Trustmark’s energy-related borrowers specifically, for an extended period of time, Trustmark could experience weakening or increased losses within its energy-related LHFI portfolio.It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.For a further discussion of the potential risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, see the risk factors under the section captioned “Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic” below.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include banks, as well as community banks operating nationwide and regionally within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  Additionally, fintech developments, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Compliance and Regulatory RisksTrustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes.  Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, 21 policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, continue to pursue enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark is subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers, including fair lending laws, and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions.The Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions.  The Department of Justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations.  A successful regulatory challenge to an institution’s performance under fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of direct or indirect negative consequences, including damages and civil money penalties, injunctive relief, restrictions on mergers and acquisitions activity, restrictions on geographic expansion, and restrictions on entering new business lines.  Private parties may also have the ability to challenge an institution’s performance under fair lending laws in private class action litigation.  Such actions could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations.  TNB recently settled a fair lending enforcement action with the Department of Justice, the OCC and the CFPB.  See the section captioned “Executive Overview” included in Part II. Item 7. - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.In addition, financial institutions face scrutiny on actions and policies that are deemed to adversely impact consumers under the Dodd-Frank Act’s prohibition against unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act’s prohibition against unfair or deceptive acts and practices.  Bank regulators and the CFPB are responsible for enforcing these prohibitions against banking organizations.  These prohibitions have been applied to prohibit perceived customer abuse in connection with a range of products, services, and practices, including account openings and fees charged where inadequate or no services are rendered for which charges were imposed, as well as other instances where consumers may have been misled through bank disclosures.  In addition, the enforcement priorities of the agencies enforcing consumer protection laws have evolved over time and may continue to do so.Failure by Trustmark to perform satisfactorily on its CRA evaluations could make it more difficult for Trustmark’s business to grow.The performance of a bank under the CRA in meeting the credit needs of its community is a factor that must be taken into consideration when the federal banking agencies evaluate applications related to mergers and acquisitions, as well as branch opening and relocations.  If TNB is unable to maintain at least a “Satisfactory” CRA rating, its ability to complete the acquisition of another financial institution or open a new branch will be adversely impacted.  If TNB received an overall CRA rating of less than “Satisfactory,” the FDIC would not re-evaluate its rating until its next CRA examination, which may not occur for several more years, and it is possible that a low CRA rating would not improve in the future.  As of its last examination, TNB received a CRA rating of “Satisfactory.”Trustmark is subject to stringent capital requirements.Under the regulatory capital rules of the FRB, OCC, and FDIC that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III, Trustmark and TNB are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of at least 4.0%.  In addition, for TNB to be “well-capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.The capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules, but this grandfather provision may cease to apply if Trustmark consummates an acquisition of a depository institution holding company and the resulting organization has $15 billion of more in total assets.FASB Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) Topic 326, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses: Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” requires Trustmark to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience, 22 current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  FASB ASC Topic 326 generally is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses, which would increase reserves and decrease capital.  Additionally, the allowance for credit losses model could be materially impacted by changes in current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions.  It is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of changes in macroeconomic conditions or the impact such changes could have on Trustmark’s allowance for credit losses; however, material changes in the allowance for credit losses could have a material impact on Trustmark’s reserves and capital.The regulatory capital rules applicable to Trustmark and TNB may continue to evolve as a result of new requirements established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or legislative, regulatory or accounting changes in the United States.  Management cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on Trustmark and TNB.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC.  Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  These regulatory expectations may change, and potentially become more rigorous in certain ways, due to an interagency effort to replace existing guidance on the risk management of third-party relationships with new guidance.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.Operational RisksThere may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on statistical and quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining expected credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Also, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.If Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price would generally be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2021, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $389.3 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2021 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide 23 assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.Trustmark holds other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2021, Trustmark held $4.6 million of other real estate, compared to $11.7 million at December 31, 2020.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Representations and Warranties Framework, which provides that FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties if the mortgage loans satisfy certain criteria, such as payment history or quality control review.Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Trustmark’s investments in premises, equipment, technology and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.Trustmark has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network.  Advances in technology such as ecommerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including interactive teller machines (ITMs) and other equipment, as well as an increasing customer preference for these other methods of accessing Trustmark’s products and services, could decrease the value of its branch network, technology, or other retail distribution physical assets and may cause Trustmark to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force.  These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of any long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate, reconfigure or close a number of Trustmark’s remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark’s control.  There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts.  Further, Trustmark’s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Trustmark may be required to expend 24 significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmarkSM) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark continues to invest in technology to facilitate the ability of its customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to its products and services.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.Trustmark’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.Trustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities.  Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”  Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.Substantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to its reputation.Damage to Trustmark’s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Trustmark’s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation.  Public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the economic downturn and related government response.  Trustmark faces increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn.  Significant harm to Trustmark’s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived 25 unethical or illegal behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark’s reputation.  Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.  Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients.  The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s businesses.Risk Related to Acquisition ActivityPotential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark continuously monitors the market for merger or acquisition opportunities and, depending upon business and other considerations, may elect to pursue one or more such opportunities in the future.  Any such merger or acquisition candidate would need to have a similar culture to Trustmark, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark’s business, potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction.  Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to mitigate its spread and economic impact could adversely affect Trustmark’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.The spread of COVID-19, and actions taken by governmental and public health authorities to mitigate its spread, such as instituting quarantines, travel restrictions and “shelter in place” orders, have caused and may continue to cause severe disruptions in both domestic and international economies, which could continue to disrupt the business, activities and operations of Trustmark’s customers, as well as its business and operations.  Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to mitigate the spread of it have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on economic activity globally, nationally and locally. Trustmark’s business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of its customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions.  A significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases may result in a significant decrease in business and/or cause Trustmark’s customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations, particularly in the event of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases in Trustmark’s market regions.  Although Trustmark maintains contingency plans for pandemic outbreaks, a significant increase in COVID-19 case above current levels could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct its business activities.  Such an increase or outbreak could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for Trustmark.  If COVID-19 spreads or the response to contain COVID-19 is unsuccessful, Trustmark could experience a material adverse effect to its business, financial condition, and results of operations.Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of actions by the FRB that affect Trustmark.  Market interest rates have declined significantly.  In March of 2020, the ten-year Treasury yield fell below 1.00% for the first time, and the FRB reduced the target federal funds rate by 150 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The FRB also reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves from 1.60% to 0.10% during March of 2020.  These rates continued throughout 2021.  The FRB has announced that it intends to begin raising rates and withdrawing other support measures starting in March 2022.  It is not clear how the markets will react to these changes; heightened volatility resulting therefrom, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect Trustmark's net results of operations or financial condition.  In addition, the federal banking agencies also issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and providing relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Pursuant to such guidance and related provisions of the CARES Act, Trustmark is not treating certain COVID-19-related loan modifications as TDRs.  For additional details regarding COVID-related loan modification, see the section captioned “COVID-19 Update – Loan Concessions” included in Part II. Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.  Finally, in response to the 26 COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB established numerous emergency programs, including various liquidity facilities, intended to mitigate disruptions to certain financial markets, all of which have since expired.  The absence of such emergency programs could result in further financial market disruptions, and adversely affect Trustmark’s business, if economic conditions decline.In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused and may continue to cause Trustmark to modify its business practices, including the implementation of temporary branch and office closures.  Trustmark may be required to take further actions by government authorities related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and may also take further actions that it determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers and business partners.  Although Trustmark has initiated certain protocol and restricted business travel in its workforce, if significant portions of its workforce, including key personnel, are unable to work effectively because of illness, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on Trustmark’s business could be exacerbated.  Further, increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, and Trustmark’s employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts in the remote environment.  In addition, Trustmark’s technological resources may be strained due to the number of remote users.The spread of COVID-19 and its impact on the economy heightens the risk associated with many of the risk factors described in this report, such as those related to credit losses and Trustmark’s reliance on its executives and third-party service providers, for example.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact Trustmark’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital, liquidity ratios and stock price, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.As a participating lender in the SBA’s PPP, Trustmark is subject to additional risks of litigation from its customers or other parties regarding TNB’s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.Trustmark participated as a lender under the PPP.  Since the opening of the PPP, several financial institutions have been subject to litigation regarding the processes and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP.  Trustmark may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached TNB regarding PPP loans, regarding its processes and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP.  In addition to litigation, Trustmark’s participation in the PPP exposes Trustmark to the possibility of governmental investigations, enforcement actions and negative publicity.  If any such litigation, enforcement action or other action is filed against Trustmark and is not resolved in a manner favorable to Trustmark, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect Trustmark’s reputation.  In addition, litigation and investigations can be costly, regardless of outcome.  Any financial liability, litigation and investigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by TNB, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP.  In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by TNB, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from Trustmark.General Risk Factors
The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include:•actual or anticipated variations in earnings;•changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;•operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;•perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole;•significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;•provisions in Trustmark’s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser;27 •changes in government regulation;•failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and•volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.  For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Trustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.Trustmark’s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel.  Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense.  While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and development of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees.  If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Climate change and societal responses to climate change could adversely affect Trustmark’s business and results of operations, including indirectly through impact to its customers.The current and anticipated effects of climate change are creating an increasing level of concern for the state of the global environment.  As a result, political and social attention to the issue of climate change has increased.  In recent years, governments across the world have entered into international agreements to attempt to reduce global temperatures, in part by limiting greenhouse gas emissions. The United States Congress, state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change.  These agreements and measures may result in the imposition of taxes and fees, the required purchase of emission credits and the implementation of significant operational changes, each of which may require businesses to expend significant capital and incur compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. It is not possible to predict how climate change may impact Trustmark’s financial condition and operations; however, Trustmark operates in areas where its business and the activities of its customers could be impacted by the effects of climate change.  The effects of climate change may include increased frequency or severity of weather-related events, such as severe storms, hurricanes, flooding and droughts and rising sea levels.  These effects can disrupt business operations, damage property, devalue assets and change customer and business preferences, which may adversely affect borrowers, increase credit risk and reduce demand for Trustmark’s products and services.  Trustmark and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns.  Trustmark and its customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes and the like.  The impact to Trustmark’s customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities.  In addition, Trustmark could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans.  Trustmark’s efforts to take these risks into account may not be effective in protecting it from the negative 28 impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior and could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations"
7,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2021-02-18,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial 16instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below. Risks Related to Trustmark’s BusinessInterest Rate RisksTrustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of actions by the FRB.  Market interest rates have declined to historical lows.  On March 3, 2020, the ten-year Treasury yield fell below 1.00% for the first time, and the FRB reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%.  On March 15, 2020, the FRB further reduced the target federal funds rate by 100 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The FRB reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves from 1.60% to 1.10% on March 3, 2020, and then to 0.10% on March 15, 2020.  Trustmark expects that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect its net interest income and margins and its profitability.  Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2020, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may increase 20.4%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may increase net interest income 10.8%.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2020, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 5.7%.Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark’s interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below: •In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently. •The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and 17other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark may be adversely affected by the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate.In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after the end of 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR.  This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after the end of 2021.  The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a committee of U.S. financial market participants, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR.  However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR.  ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.  While the benchmark provider for US$ LIBOR (which is typically the benchmark that Trustmark uses) has announced that it intends to provide the benchmark through June 2023, Trustmark continues to work to transition to SOFR by the end of 2021.Trustmark has a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.  The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk.  Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR.  The transition will change Trustmark’s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies.  Trustmark has organized an internal initiative to identify operational and contractual best practices, assess its risks, manage the transition, facilitate communication with its customers, and monitor the impacts.  Trustmark cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be; however, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation with its customers.Credit and Lending RisksTrustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, they remain at depressed levels in certain regions.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for credit losses and may require an increase in the provision for credit losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required, to make further increases in its provision for credit losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Additionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.  This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and other information.  Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Declines in asset values may result in credit losses and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be 18affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for expected credit losses.  As of December 31, 2020, gross unrealized losses on securities for which an allowance for credit losses has not been recorded totaled $1.9 million.  Trustmark may be required to record credit loss expense if these investments suffer a decline in value that is the result of a credit loss.  If Trustmark determines that a credit loss exists, the credit portion of the allowance would be measured using a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis using the effective interest rate as of the security’s purchase date.  The amount of credit loss Trustmark may record is limited to the amount by which the amortized cost exceeds the fair value, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a credit loss, if any, occurs.Liquidity RiskTrustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.External and Market-Related RisksTrustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and around the world.  The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect economic activity globally, nationally and locally.  Actions taken around the world to help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 include restrictions on travel, quarantines in certain areas, and forced closures for certain types of public places and businesses.  COVID-19 and actions taken to mitigate the spread of it have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on the economies and financial markets of many regions, including the geographical area in which Trustmark operates and industries in which Trustmark regularly extends credit.  Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term.  While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. While domestic demand for loans has improved, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising rates and modest economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.Interest rates remain within a historically low level that, when combined with the extended period of lower interest rates in recent years, continue to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors).  Any further declines in interest rates will place additional competitive pressure on net interest margins.  Conversely, increases in interest rates will place competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.19Despite recent optimism resulting from stabilization in the housing sector, improvement of unemployment data and credit quality improvement, Trustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events: •Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses. •Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. •Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch. •As of December 31, 2020, energy-related LHFI represented approximately 1.0% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio and consisted principally of loans within the oilfield services and midstream segments.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2020, approximately 10.2% of Trustmark’s energy-related LHFI, or 0.1% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, were classified as nonaccrual.  Trustmark has no loan exposure where the source of repayment, or the underlying security of such exposure, is tied to the realization of value from energy reserves.  Nonetheless, if oil prices fall below current levels for an extended period of time, Trustmark could experience weakening or increased losses within its energy-related LHFI portfolio.It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.For a further discussion of the potential risks posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, see the risk factors under the section captioned “Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic” below.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include banks, as well as community banks operating nationwide and regionally within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  Additionally, fintech developments, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.20The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Compliance and Regulatory RisksTrustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes.  Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, continue to pursue enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark is subject to stringent capital requirements.Under the regulatory capital rules of the FRB, OCC, and FDIC that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III, Trustmark and TNB are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of at least 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of at least 4.0%.  In addition, for TNB to be “well-capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 8.0%, a total capital ratio of at least 10.0% and a leverage ratio of at least 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.The capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly-issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules, but this grandfather provision may cease to apply if Trustmark grows to $15 billion or more in total assets as a result of an acquisition of a depository institution holding company.Additionally, the FASB Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which implements CECL as a new impairment model based on expected credit losses, requires Trustmark to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  CECL generally is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses, which would increase reserves and decrease capital.  Additionally, the CECL model could be materially impacted by changes in current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions.  It is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of changes in macroeconomic conditions or the impact such changes could have on Trustmark’s allowance for credit losses; however, material changes in the allowance for credit losses could have a material impact on Trustmark’s reserves and capital.21The regulatory capital rules applicable to Trustmark and TNB may continue to evolve as a result of new requirements established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or legislative, regulatory or accounting changes in the United States.  Management cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on Trustmark and TNB.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC.  Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.Operational RisksThere may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining expected credit losses are inadequate, the allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Also, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.If Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price would generally be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2020, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $392.7 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2020 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.22Trustmark holds a significant amount of other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2020, Trustmark held $11.7 million of other real estate, compared to $29.2 million at December 31, 2019.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Lending and Selling Representations and Warranties Framework updated in May 2014, which provides certain instances in which FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, such as payment history and quality control review.Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Trustmark’s investments in premises, equipment, technology and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.Trustmark has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network.  Advances in technology such as ecommerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including interactive teller machines and other equipment, as well as an increasing customer preference for these other methods of accessing Trustmark’s products and services, could decrease the value of its branch network, technology, or other retail distribution physical assets and may cause Trustmark to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force.  These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of any long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate, reconfigure or close a number of Trustmark’s remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark’s control.  There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts.  Further, Trustmark’s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Trustmark may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which 23may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmarkSM) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark continues to invest in technology to facilitate the ability of its customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to its products and services.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.Trustmark’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.Trustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities.  Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”  Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.Substantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to its reputation.Damage to Trustmark’s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Trustmark’s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation.  Public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the economic downturn and related government response.  Trustmark faces increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn.  Significant harm to Trustmark’s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark’s 24reputation.  Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.  Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients.  The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s businesses.Risk Related to Acquisition ActivityPotential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark continuously monitors the market for merger or acquisition opportunities and, depending upon business and other considerations, may elect to pursue one or more such opportunities in the future.  Any such merger or acquisition candidate would need to have a similar culture to Trustmark, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark’s business, potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction.  Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken to mitigate its spread and economic impact, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, could adversely affect Trustmark’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.The spread of a highly infectious or contagious disease, such as COVID-19, and actions taken by governmental and public health authorities to mitigate its spread, such as instituting quarantines, travel restrictions and “shelter in place” orders, have lead to severe disruptions in the United States economy, which could continue to disrupt the business, activities and operations of Trustmark’s customers, as well as its business and operations.  Moreover, since the beginning of January 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruption in the financial markets both globally and in the United States.  Trustmark’s business is dependent upon the willingness and ability of its customers to conduct banking and other financial transactions.  A significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases, or an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, may result in a significant decrease in business and/or cause Trustmark’s customers to be unable to meet existing payment or other obligations, particularly in the event of a significant increase in COVID-19 cases or an outbreak of an infectious disease in Trustmark’s market regions.  Although Trustmark maintains contingency plans for pandemic outbreaks, a significant increase in COVID-19 case above current levels, or an outbreak of another contagious disease, could also negatively impact the availability of key personnel necessary to conduct its business activities. Such an increase or outbreak could also negatively impact the business and operations of third-party service providers who perform critical services for Trustmark.  If COVID-19, or another highly infectious or contagious disease, spreads or the response to contain COVID-19 is unsuccessful, Trustmark could continue to experience a material adverse effect to its business, financial condition, and results of operations.Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected the financial markets and has resulted in a number of actions by the FRB that affect Trustmark.  Market interest rates have declined significantly.  On March 3, 2020, the ten-year Treasury yield fell below 1.00% for the first time, and the FRB reduced the target federal funds rate by 50 basis points to a range of 1.00% to 1.25%.  On March 15, 2020, the FRB further reduced the target federal funds rate by 100 basis points to a range of 0.00% to 0.25% and announced a $700 billion quantitative easing program in response to the expected economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  The FRB reduced the interest that it pays on excess reserves from 1.60% to 1.10% on March 3, 2020, and then to 0.10% on March 15, 2020.  Trustmark expects that these reductions in interest rates, especially if prolonged, could adversely affect its net interest income and margins and its profitability.  In addition, the federal banking agencies have also issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to prudently work with affected borrowers and have providing relief from reporting loan classifications due to modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Pursuant to such guidance and related provisions of the CARES Act, Trustmark is not treating certain COVID-19-related loan modifications as TDRs.  For additional details regarding COVID-related loan modification, see the section captioned “COVID-19 Update – Loan Concessions” included in Part II. Item 7. – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.  Finally, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FRB established numerous emergency programs, including various liquidity facilities, intended to mitigate disruptions 25to certain financial markets.  The expiration or termination of any of these FRB emergency programs could result in further financial market disruptions, and adversely affect Trustmark’s business.In addition, the spread of COVID-19 has caused Trustmark to modify its business practices, including the implementation of temporary branch and office closures.  Trustmark may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that it determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers and business partners.  Although Trustmark has initiated a remote work protocol and restricted business travel in its workforce, if significant portions of its workforce, including key personnel, are unable to work effectively because of illness, government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on Trustmark’s business could be exacerbated.  Further, increased levels of remote access may create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, and Trustmark’s employees may be more susceptible to phishing and social engineering attempts in the remote environment.  In addition, Trustmark’s technological resources may be strained due to the number of remote users.The spread of COVID-19 and its impact on the economy heightens the risk associated with many of the risk factors described in this report, such as those related to credit losses and Trustmark’s reliance on its executives and third-party service providers, for example.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact Trustmark’s business, results of operations and financial condition, as well as its regulatory capital, liquidity ratios and stock price, will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.As a participating lender in the SBA’s PPP, Trustmark is subject to additional risks of litigation from its customers or other parties regarding TNB’s processing of loans for the PPP and risks that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties.Trustmark is participating as an eligible lender under the PPP.  Since the opening of the PPP, several financial institutions have been subject to litigation regarding the processes and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP.  Trustmark may be exposed to the risk of similar litigation, from both customers and non-customers that approached TNB regarding PPP loans, regarding its processes and procedures used in processing applications for the PPP.  In addition to litigation, Trustmark’s participation in the PPP exposes Trustmark to the possibility of governmental investigations, enforcement actions and negative publicity.  If any such litigation, enforcement action or other action is filed against Trustmark and is not resolved in a manner favorable to Trustmark, it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect Trustmark’s reputation.  In addition, litigation and investigations can be costly, regardless of outcome.  Any financial liability, litigation and investigation costs or reputational damage caused by PPP related litigation could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark also has credit risk on PPP loans if a determination is made by the SBA that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated, funded, or serviced by TNB, such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan, which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws, rules and guidance regarding the operation of the PPP.  In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the PPP loan was originated, funded, or serviced by TNB, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty, or, if it has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from Trustmark.General Risk Factors
The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include: •actual or anticipated variations in earnings; •changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections; •operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; •perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole; •significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors; •provisions in Trustmark’s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser; •changes in government regulation;26  •failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and •volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.  For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Trustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.Trustmark’s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel.  Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense.  While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and development of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees.  If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations"
3,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2020-02-20,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below. Trustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  During October 2019, the FRB lowered the target range for the federal funds rate for the third time in 2019 as anticipated.  While recently-released FRB minutes indicate that a majority of the Board believe that there is not a need to cut rates further, the level of future rates will likely depend upon the performance of the economy.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.  Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2019, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may increase 5.7%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may increase net interest income 3.0%.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2019, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 5.2%.Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark’s interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below: •In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently. •The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.17Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.The economy continued to show moderate signs of improvement in 2019; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of volatility in crude oil prices and uncertain growth prospects in emerging markets, combined with uncertainty regarding the potential monetary policy changes by the FRB, the consequences of the decision of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, the potential impact on the economy of the current United States presidential administration’s policies and United States trade relations, particularly with China.  Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term.  While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. While domestic demand for loans has improved, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising rates and modest economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.Interest rates remain within a low range that, when combined with the extended period of historically low interest rates in recent years, continue to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors).  Any further declines in interest rates will place additional competitive pressure on net interest margins.  Conversely, increases in interest rates will place competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of changes to interest rates, or the impact rate changes will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.Despite recent optimism resulting from stabilization in the housing sector, improvement of unemployment data and credit quality improvement, Trustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events: •Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses. •Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. •Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch. •The price per barrel of crude oil remained volatile during 2019.  As of December 31, 2019, energy-related LHFI represented approximately 1.3% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio and consisted principally of loans within the oilfield services and midstream segments.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2019, approximately 8.6% of Trustmark’s energy-18 related LHFI, or 0.1% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, were classified as nonperforming or nonaccrual.  Trustmark has no loan exposure where the source of repayment, or the underlying security of such exposure, is tied to the realization of value from energy reserves.  Nonetheless, if oil prices fall below current levels for an extended period of time, Trustmark could experience weakening or increased losses within its energy-related LHFI portfolio.It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, they remain at depressed levels in certain regions.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required, to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Additionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.  This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and other information.  Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.Trustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes.  Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation 19or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, continue to pursue enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark is subject to stringent capital requirements.Under the regulatory capital rules of the FRB, OCC, and FDIC that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III, Trustmark and TNB are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 4.0%.  In addition, for TNB to be “well-capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.The capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly-issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules, but this grandfather provision may cease to apply if Trustmark grows to $15 billion or more in total assets as a result of an acquisition of a depository institution holding company.Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which implements CECL as a new impairment model based on expected credit losses, will require Trustmark to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  CECL generally is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses, which would increase reserves and decrease capital.  Additionally, the CECL model could be materially impacted by changes in current and forecasted macroeconomic conditions.  It is not possible to predict the timing or magnitude of changes in macroeconomic conditions or the impact such changes could have on Trustmark’s allowance for expected credit losses; however, material changes in the allowance for expected credit losses could have a material impact on Trustmark’s reserves and capital.The regulatory capital rules applicable to Trustmark and TNB may continue to evolve as a result of new requirements established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or legislative, regulatory or accounting changes in the United States.  Management cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on Trustmark and TNB.There may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Also, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s 20shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark may be adversely affected by the transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate.In 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR.  This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021.  The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC), a committee of U.S. financial market participants, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to USD-LIBOR.  However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR.  ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry-wide and company-specific transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR.Trustmark has a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.  The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk.  Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR.  The transition will change Trustmark’s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies.  Trustmark has organized an internal initiative to identify operational and contractual best practices, assess its risks, manage the transition, facilitate communication with its customers, and monitor the impacts.  Trustmark cannot predict what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be; however, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation with its customers.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.If Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price would generally be allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2019, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $387.0 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2019 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.Trustmark holds a significant amount of other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2019, Trustmark held $29.2 million of other real estate, compared to $34.7 million at December 31, 2018.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.21On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators.  As of December 31, 2019, gross unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities totaled $7.3 million.  Trustmark may be required to record impairment charges if these investments suffer a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.  If it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred, Trustmark would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a write-off, if any, occurs.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Lending and Selling Representations and Warranties Framework updated in May 2014, which provides certain instances in which FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, such as payment history and quality control review.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks, as well as community banks within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  At this time, major international banks do not materially compete directly with Trustmark in its markets, although they may do so in the future.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  Additionally, fintech developments, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Changes in retail distribution strategies and consumer behavior may adversely impact Trustmark’s investments in premises, equipment, technology and other assets and may lead to increased expenditures to change its retail distribution channel.Trustmark has significant investments in bank premises and equipment for its branch network.  Advances in technology such as ecommerce, telephone, internet and mobile banking, and in-branch self-service technologies including interactive teller machines and other equipment, as well as an increasing customer preference for these other methods of accessing Trustmark’s products and services, could decrease the value of its branch network, technology, or other retail distribution physical assets and may cause Trustmark to change its retail distribution strategy, close and/or sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force.  These actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of any long-lived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate, reconfigure or close a number of Trustmark’s remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel.22Potential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark continuously monitors the market for merger or acquisition opportunities and, depending upon business and other considerations, may elect to pursue one or more such opportunities in the future.  Any such merger or acquisition candidate would need to have a similar culture to Trustmark, have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark’s business, potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction.  Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the acquisition of an insured depository institution that subsequently fails could significantly adversely affect an affiliated insured depository institution.  Under cross-guarantee provisions of the FDI Act, the FDIC may recoup losses to the DIF by assessing a claim against insured depository institutions under common control for losses caused by the failure of an affiliated insured depository institution.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark’s control.  There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts.  Further, Trustmark’s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Trustmark may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmarkSM) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.23Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark continues to invest in technology to facilitate the ability of its customers to engage in financial transactions, and otherwise enhance the customer experience with respect to its products and services.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC.  Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.Trustmark’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include: •actual or anticipated variations in earnings; •changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections; •operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; •perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole; •significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;24 •provisions in Trustmark’s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser; •changes in government regulation; •failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and •volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.  For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Trustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.Trustmark’s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel.  Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense.  While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and development of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees.  If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.Trustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities.  Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”  Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.Substantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to its reputation.Damage to Trustmark’s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Trustmark’s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation.  Public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the economic downturn and related government response.  Trustmark faces increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn.  Significant harm to Trustmark’s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived 25unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark’s reputation.  Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.  Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients.  The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s businesses"
1,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2019-02-19,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below. Trustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  During December 2018, the FRB increased the target range for the federal funds rate for the fourth time in 2018 as anticipated.  The FRB also continues to reduce the size of its 16balance sheet.  It is not possible to predict the impact, if any, on market interest rates (or on markets generally) of efforts by the FRB to continue to reduce the size of its balance sheet.  Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2018, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may decrease 0.9%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may decrease net interest income 0.5%.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2018, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 1.2%.Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark's interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below: •In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently. •The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.The economy continued to show moderate signs of improvement in 2018; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of volatility in crude oil prices and uncertain growth prospects in Russia and other emerging markets, combined with uncertainty regarding the possibility of further tightening of the monetary policy by the FRB and the potential market impact of efforts by the FRB to reduce the size of its balance sheet, the consequences of the decision of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, the potential impact on the economy of the current presidential administration’s policies, United States trade relations and the recent shut-down of the United States Government.  Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, 17and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term.  While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. While domestic demand for loans has improved, particularly for commercial loans, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising rates and modest economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.Notwithstanding recent increases in the target rate for federal funds by the FRB, interest rates remain within a low range that, when combined with the extended period of historically low interest rates in recent years, continue to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors).  The FRB has indicated that further increases in rates in 2019 will depend on market conditions.  Further increases in interest rates will place competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of rising interest rates, or the impact rising rates will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.Despite recent optimism resulting from stabilization in the housing sector, improvement of unemployment data and credit quality improvement, Trustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events: •Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses. •Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. •Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch. •The price per barrel of crude oil remained volatile during 2018.  As of December 31, 2018, energy-related LHFI represented approximately 2.0% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, and consisted principally of loans within the oilfield services and midstream segments.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2018, approximately 7.0% of Trustmark’s energy-related LHFI, or 0.1% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, were classified as nonperforming or nonaccrual.  Trustmark has no loan exposure where the source of repayment, or the underlying security of such exposure, is tied to the realization of value from energy reserves.  Nonetheless, if oil prices fall below current levels for an extended period of time, Trustmark could experience weakening or increased losses within its energy-related LHFI portfolio.It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, they remain at depressed levels in certain regions.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required, to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.18Additionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.  This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and other information.  Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.Trustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes.  Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, continue to pursue enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark is subject to stringent capital requirements.Under the regulatory capital rules of the FRB, OCC, and FDIC that implement a set of capital requirements issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision known as Basel III, Trustmark and TNB are required to maintain a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 7.0% (a minimum of 4.5% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5% (a minimum of 6.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%), a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5% (a minimum of 8.0% plus a capital conservation buffer of 2.5%) and a leverage ratio of Tier 1 capital to total consolidated assets of 4.0%.  In addition, for TNB to be “well-capitalized” under the banking agencies’ prompt corrective action framework, it must have a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.0%, a total capital ratio of 10.0% and a leverage ratio of 5.0%, and must not be subject to any written agreement, order or capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive issued by its primary federal regulator to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  Certain capital requirements, such as the capital conservation buffer, became fully phased in on January 1, 2019.19The capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly-issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules, but this grandfather provision may cease to apply if Trustmark grows to $15 billion or more in total assets as a result of an acquisition of a depository institution holding company.Additionally, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standard Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which implements CECL as a new impairment model based on expected credit losses, will require Trustmark to recognize all expected credit losses over the life of a loan based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  CECL generally is expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses, which would increase reserves and decrease capital.  Trustmark cannot predict the impact of CECL on its reserves and capital; however, the impact could be material.The regulatory capital rules applicable to Trustmark and TNB may continue to evolve as a result of new requirements established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision or legislative, regulatory or accounting changes in the United States.  Management cannot predict the effect that any changes to current capital requirements would have on Trustmark and TNB.There may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Also, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.When Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price is generally allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2018, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $390.7 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2018 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.Trustmark holds a significant amount of other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2018, Trustmark held $34.7 million of other real estate, compared to $43.2 million at December 31, 2017.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses 20associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators.  As of December 31, 2018, gross unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities totaled $64.4 million.  Trustmark may be required to record impairment charges if these investments suffer a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.  If it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred, Trustmark would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a write-off, if any, occurs.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Lending and Selling Representations and Warranties Framework updated in May 2014, which provides certain instances in which FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, such as payment history and quality control review.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks, as well as community banks within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  At this time, major international banks do not materially compete directly with Trustmark in its markets, although they may do so in the future.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  Additionally, fintech developments, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.21Potential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services, and Trustmark will likely continue to seek to acquire such businesses in the future.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark’s business, potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the acquisition of an insured depository institution that subsequently fails could significantly adversely affect an affiliated insured depository institution.  Under cross-guarantee provisions of the FDI Act, the FDIC may recoup losses to the DIF by assessing a claim against insured depository institutions under common control for losses caused by the failure of an affiliated insured depository institution.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark’s control.  There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts.  Further, Trustmark’s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Trustmark may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmarkSM) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.22Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties, and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC.  Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.Trustmark’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include: •actual or anticipated variations in earnings; •changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections; •operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; •perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole; •significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors; •provisions in Trustmark’s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser; •changes in government regulation;23 •failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and •volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the FASB changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.  For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects all current expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss estimates.  Trustmark intends to adopt ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020, and adoption of this ASU could materially affect its allowance for loan losses methodology, financial condition, capital levels and results of operations, including expenses Trustmark may incur in implementing this ASU.  For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Trustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.Trustmark’s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel.  Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense.  While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and developments of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees.  If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.Trustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities.  Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”  Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.Substantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.Damage to Trustmark’s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Trustmark’s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation.  Public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the economic downturn and related government response.  Trustmark faces increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn.  Significant harm to Trustmark’s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived 24unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark’s reputation.  Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.  Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients.  The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s businesses"
13,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2018-02-20,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below. Trustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  During June 2017, the FRB increased the target range for the federal funds rate for the third consecutive quarter.  In December 2017, the FRB further increased rates and commenced reducing the size of its balance sheet.  In December 2017, the FRB also predicted an additional three interest rate hikes in 2018.  It is not possible to predict the impact, if any, on market interest rates of efforts by the FRB to reduce the size of its balance sheet.Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between 17interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2017, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may decrease 2.1%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may decrease net interest income 1.0%.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2017, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 4.2%.Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark's interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below: •In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently. •The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.The economy continued to show moderate signs of improvement in 2017; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of volatility in crude oil prices and uncertain growth prospects in Russia and other emerging markets, combined with uncertainty regarding the impact of further tightening of the monetary policy by the FRB, the consequences of the decision of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union, and the potential impact on the economy of the current presidential administration’s policies.  Doubts surrounding the near-term direction of global markets, and the potential impact of these trends on the United States economy, are expected to persist for the near term.  While Trustmark’s customer base is wholly domestic, international economic conditions affect domestic conditions, and thus may have an impact upon Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. While domestic demand for loans has improved, particularly for commercial loans, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from rising rates and modest economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.18During June 2017, the FRB increased the target range for the federal funds rate for the third consecutive quarter.  In December 2017, the FRB further increased rates and commenced reducing the size of its balance sheet.  In December 2017, the FRB predicted an additional three interest rate hikes in 2018.  It is not possible to predict the impact, if any, on market interest rates of efforts by the FRB to reduce the size of its balance sheet.  The extended period of low interest rates continues to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors); however, interest rates have increased during 2017 and the FRB has indicated that it intends to continue to raise rates in 2018.  Any increases in interest rates will place competitive pressures on the deposit cost of funds.  It is not possible to predict the pace and magnitude of rising interest rates, or the impact rising rates will have on Trustmark’s results of operations.Despite recent optimism resulting from stabilization in the housing sector, improvement of unemployment data and credit quality improvement, Trustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events: •Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses. •Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. •Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch. •The price per barrel of crude oil remained volatile during 2017.  As of December 31, 2017, energy-related LHFI represented approximately 2.6% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, and consisted principally of loans within the oilfield services and midstream segments.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2017, approximately 9.7% of Trustmark’s energy-related LHFI, or 0.3% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, were classified as nonperforming or nonaccrual.  Trustmark has no loan exposure where the source of repayment, or the underlying security of such exposure, is tied to the realization of value from energy reserves.  Nonetheless, if oil prices remain at current levels or below for an extended period of time, Trustmark could experience weakening or increased losses within its energy-related LHFI portfolio.It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, they remain at depressed levels in certain regions.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required to, to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Additionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.  This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and other information.  Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial 19statements, credit reports, or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Federal Reserve Discount Window (Discount Window) and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.Trustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes.  Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, continue to pursue enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark is subject to stringent capital requirements.On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on the calibration and phase-in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III.  The FRB, OCC, and FDIC issued final rules establishing regulatory capital requirements consistent with Basel III and implementing the capital requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2013.  These capital rules require, among other things, a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, net of regulatory deductions, and establish a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% of common equity to risk-weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital requirement, effectively establishing a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 7%.  In addition, the capital rules increased the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets.  The capital rules also specify that a banking organization with a capital conservation buffer that does not exceed 2.5% shall face limitations on capital distributions and bonus payments to executives.The capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly-issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by a grandfather provision in the capital rules.20Trustmark and TNB were required to comply with the revised capital rules beginning January 1, 2015.  Certain of the requirements of the revised capital rules, such as the capital conservation buffer, will be phased in until January 1, 2019.  Once the revised capital requirements are fully phased in, Trustmark and TNB will be required to hold a greater amount of capital and a greater amount of common equity than they were previously required to hold.  Management does not expect the capital rules to have a significant impact on Trustmark or TNB.Unfavorable results from ongoing stress test analyses conducted on Trustmark and TNB may adversely affect Trustmark’s ability to approve, declare and pay dividends to shareholders or compete for new business opportunities.The FRB and OCC require Trustmark and TNB to perform periodic stress tests and analysis to evaluate their ability to absorb losses in various economic and financial scenarios.  This stress test analysis uses three economic and financial scenarios generated by the FRB and OCC, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios.  Trustmark and TNB are required to make certain assumptions in modeling future performance and must support these assumptions through statistical analysis and observed market behavior where applicable.  Results of the stress tests and analysis performed by Trustmark and TNB must be submitted to the FRB and the OCC annually to be used in the regulators’ analysis.The outcome of the FRB’s analysis of Trustmark’s projected performance (including capital, earnings and balance sheet changes) could hinder Trustmark’s ability to pay cash dividends to shareholders at levels consistent with prior practice, or at all.  The results of the stress tests could also impact decision making regarding future acquisitions by Trustmark as well as Trustmark’s ability to effectively compete for new business opportunities.Additionally, the FRB and OCC may require Trustmark and TNB to raise additional capital or take other actions, or may impose restrictions on its business, based on the results of the stress tests, including requiring revisions or changes to capital plans.  Trustmark and TNB may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on favorable terms.  Any such capital raises, if required, may also be dilutive to existing shareholders.There may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, conducting capital stress testing, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Also, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.When Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price is generally allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2017, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $396.0 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2017 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.21Trustmark holds a significant amount of other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2017, Trustmark held $43.2 million of other real estate, compared to $62.1 million at December 31, 2016.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators.  As of December 31, 2017, gross unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities totaled $42.1 million.  Trustmark may be required to record impairment charges if these investments suffer a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.  If it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred, Trustmark would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a write-off, if any, occurs.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Lending and Selling Representations and Warranties Framework updated in May 2014, which provides certain instances in which FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, such as payment history and quality control review.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks, as well as community banks within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  At this time, major international banks do not materially compete directly with Trustmark in its markets, although they may do so in the future.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  Additionally, fintech developments, such as blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies, have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.22Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Potential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services, and Trustmark will likely continue to seek to acquire such businesses in the future.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark’s business, potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the acquisition of an insured depository institution that subsequently fails could significantly adversely affect an affiliated insured depository institution.  Under cross-guarantee provisions of the FDI Act, the FDIC may recoup losses to the DIF by assessing a claim against insured depository institutions under common control for losses caused by the failure of an affiliated insured depository institution.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark’s control.  There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts.  Further, Trustmark’s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Trustmark may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which 23may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmarkSM) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties, and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, OCC, CFPB and FDIC.  Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.Trustmark’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.24The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include: •actual or anticipated variations in earnings; •changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections; •operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; •perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole; •significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors; •provisions in Trustmark’s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser; •changes in government regulation; •failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and •volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The most recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.  For example, in June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” which replaces the current incurred loss impairment methodology with a methodology that reflects all current expected credit losses (CECL) and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to determine credit loss estimates.  Trustmark intends to adopt ASU 2016-13 during the first quarter of 2020, and adoption of this ASU could materially affect its allowance for loan losses methodology, financial condition, capital levels and results of operations, including expenses Trustmark may incur in implementing this ASU.  For additional details regarding recently adopted and pending accounting pronouncements, see Note 1 – Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II. Item 8. - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.Trustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.Trustmark’s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel.  Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense.  While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and developments of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees.  If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.25Trustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.Trustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities.  Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”  Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.Substantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.Damage to Trustmark’s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Trustmark’s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation.  Public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the economic downturn and related government response.  Trustmark faces increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn.  Significant harm to Trustmark’s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark’s reputation.  Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.  Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients.  The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s businesses"
10,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2017-02-21,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could, individually or in combination, materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below. Trustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  In December 2015 and again in December 2016, the FRB increased the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points.  The FRB also indicated that it may further increase rates in the future.  It is not possible to predict the timing or amount of any further changes to the federal funds rate.Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2016, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may decrease 0.12%, while a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates, may increase net interest income 0.04%.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2016, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 6.33%.17Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark's interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below: •In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently. •The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge the mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.The economy showed moderate signs of improvement in 2016; however, economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of continued soft labor markets in the United States, volatility in crude oil prices and slowing growth in markets in Western Europe, Japan, China, Russia and other emerging markets, combined with uncertainty regarding anticipated further tightening of monetary policy by the FRB, the consequences of the decision of the United Kingdom to exit the European Union and the recent presidential election.  The U.S. and European economies and financial markets tend to be closely associated, and therefore significant weakness in Europe would likely dampen domestic growth prospects during 2017. While domestic demand for loans has improved, particularly for commercial loans, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from low rates and sluggish economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the complexities presented by current economic conditions, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenue and effectively managing the costs of compliance.In December 2016, the FRB increased the target range for the federal funds rate and indicated that it may further increase rates in the future, depending on economic conditions.  Continued low interest rates will continue to place pressure on net interest margins for Trustmark (as well as its competitors), as older, higher-yielding assets that mature or default and can only be replaced with lower-yielding instruments.  In addition, Management must protect against an increased vulnerability to rapidly changing rates in coming years in the event the current low-rate environment is replaced by a more volatile environment, which could increase exposure to reduced revenue from tighter margins.18Despite recent optimism resulting from stabilization in the housing sector, improvement of unemployment data and credit quality improvement, Trustmark does not assume that current uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events: •Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses. •Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. •Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that could make valuation of assets more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such charge, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch. •The price per barrel of crude oil remained volatile during 2016.  As of December 31, 2016, energy-related LHFI represented approximately 3.5% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, and consisted principally of loans within the oilfield services and midstream segments.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, approximately 4.2% of Trustmark’s energy-related LHFI, or 0.1% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, were classified as nonperforming or nonaccrual.  Trustmark has no loan exposure where the source of repayment, or the underlying security of such exposure, is tied to the realization of value from energy reserves.  Nonetheless, if oil prices remain at low levels for an extended period, Trustmark could experience weaker energy-related loan demand or increased losses within its energy-related LHFI portfolio.It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the United States (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, they remain at depressed levels in certain regions.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the United States economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required to, to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Additionally, Trustmark may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions.  This information could include financial statements, credit reports, business plans, and other information.  Trustmark may also rely on representations of those customers, counterparties, or other third parties, such as independent auditors, as to the accuracy and completeness of that information.  Reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements, credit reports, or other information could have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s business, financial condition, and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale 19borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Federal Reserve Discount Window and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.Trustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain nonbank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes.  The Dodd-Frank Act instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes.  Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, civil money penalties, other sanctions by regulatory agencies and/or reputational damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark will be subject to increasingly stringent capital requirements.On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on the calibration and phase-in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III.  The FRB, OCC, and FDIC issued final rules establishing regulatory capital requirements consistent with Basel III and implementing the capital requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2013.  These capital rules require, among other things, a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, net of regulatory deductions, and establish a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% of common equity to risk-weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital requirement, effectively establishing a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 7%.  In addition, the capital rules increased the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets.  The capital rules also specify that a bank with a capital conservation buffer that does not exceed 2.5% shall face limitations on capital distributions and bonus payments to executives.The capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly-issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to count $60.0 million in outstanding trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by the grandfather provision in the capital rules.Trustmark and TNB were required to comply with the revised capital rules beginning January 1, 2015.  Certain of the requirements of the revised capital rules, such as the capital conservation buffer, will be phased in until January 1, 2019.  Once the revised capital requirements are fully phased in, it is expected that Trustmark and TNB will be required to hold a greater amount of capital and a greater amount of common equity than they were previously required to hold.  Management does not expect the capital rules to have a significant impact on Trustmark or TNB; however, Management will continue to evaluate the impact of the capital rules on Trustmark and TNB as they are phased in.20Unfavorable results from ongoing stress test analyses conducted on Trustmark and TNB may adversely affect Trustmark’s ability to approve, declare and pay dividends to shareholders or compete for new business opportunities.The FRB and OCC require Trustmark and TNB to perform periodic stress tests and analysis to evaluate their ability to absorb losses in various economic and financial scenarios.  This stress test analysis uses three economic and financial scenarios generated by the FRB and OCC, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios.  Trustmark and TNB are required to make certain assumptions in modeling future performance and must support these assumptions through statistical analysis and observed market behavior where applicable.  Results of the stress tests and analysis performed by Trustmark and TNB must be submitted to the FRB and the OCC annually to be used in the regulators’ analysis.The outcome of the FRB’s analysis of Trustmark’s projected performance (including capital, earnings and balance sheet changes) could hinder Trustmark’s ability to pay cash dividends to shareholders at levels consistent with prior practice, or at all.  The results of the stress tests could also impact decision making regarding future acquisitions by Trustmark as well as Trustmark’s ability to effectively compete for new business opportunities.Additionally, the FRB and OCC may require Trustmark and TNB to raise additional capital or take other actions, or may impose restrictions on its business, based on the results of the stress tests, including requiring revisions or changes to capital plans.  Trustmark and TNB may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on favorable terms.  Any such capital raises, if required, may also be dilutive to existing shareholders.There may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, conducting capital stress testing, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Also, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.When Trustmark consummates an acquisition, a portion of the purchase price is generally allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2016, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $386.8 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2016 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.Trustmark holds a significant amount of other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2016, Trustmark held $62.1 million of other real estate, compared to $78.8 million at December 31, 2015.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could 21lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties as well as to remediate any environmental cleanup costs incurred in connection with any contamination discovered on real property on which Trustmark has foreclosed and to which Trustmark has taken title.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators.  As of December 31, 2016, gross unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities totaled $30.5 million.  Trustmark may be required to record impairment charges if these investments suffer a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.  If it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred, Trustmark would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a write-off, if any, occurs.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a significant number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the anticipated economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Lending and Selling Representations and Warranties Framework updated in May 2014, which provides certain instances in which FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, such as payment history and quality control review.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have greater financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks, as well as community banks within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  At this time, major international banks do not compete directly with Trustmark in its markets, although they may do so in the future.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  Additionally, fintech developments, such as distributed ledger technology (or blockchain), have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.22Potential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services, and Trustmark will likely continue to seek to acquire such businesses in the future.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company, exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company, difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company, potential disruption to Trustmark’s business, potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention, the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company, difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the acquisition of an insured depository institution that subsequently fails could significantly adversely affect an affiliated insured depository institution.  Under cross-guarantee provisions of the FDI Act, the FDIC may recoup losses to the DIF by assessing a claim against insured depository institutions under common control for losses caused by the failure of an affiliated insured depository institution.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, which could, in turn, lead to defaults or losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond Trustmark’s control.  There could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including terrorist acts.  Further, Trustmark’s operational and security systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Trustmark may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities (myTrustmarkSM) could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  However, these precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.23Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services, which could require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks, including cyber-security risks.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties, and relies on certain third-parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC.  Under regulatory guidance, Trustmark is required to apply stringent due diligence, conduct ongoing monitoring and maintain effective control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to ensure adequate due diligence is performed and to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures effectively mitigate risk, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.Trustmark’s controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures are based in part on assumptions, and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met.  Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition and results of operations.The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry, such as Trustmark, may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include: •actual or anticipated variations in earnings; •changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections; •operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; •perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole; •significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors; •provisions in Trustmark’s by-laws and articles of incorporation that may discourage takeover attempts, which may make Trustmark less attractive to a potential purchaser; •changes in government regulation;24 •failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and •volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The recent economic recession resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark may not be able to attract or retain key employees.Trustmark’s success depends substantially on its ability to attract and retain skilled, experienced personnel.  Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that Trustmark serves is intense.  While Trustmark invests significantly in the training and developments of its employees, it is possible that Trustmark may not be able to retain key employees.  If Trustmark were unable to retain its most qualified employees, its performance and competitive positioning could be materially adversely affected.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas, which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark may be subject to increased claims and litigation, which could result in legal liability and reputational damage.Trustmark has been named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its businesses and activities.  Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. In recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed “lender liability.”  Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.Substantial legal liability against Trustmark, including its subsidiaries, could materially adversely affect Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.Damage to Trustmark’s reputation could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Trustmark’s ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by its reputation.  Public perception of the financial services industry declined as a result of the economic downturn and related government response.  Trustmark faces increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn.  Significant harm to Trustmark’s reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, litigation or regulatory outcomes, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, compliance failures, disclosure of confidential information, significant or numerous failures, interruptions or breaches of its information systems and the activities of its clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial services industry generally or by certain members or individuals in the industry may have a significant adverse effect on Trustmark’s reputation.  Trustmark could also suffer significant reputational harm if it fails to properly identify and manage potential conflicts of interest.  Management of potential conflicts of interests has become increasingly complex as Trustmark expands its business activities 25through more numerous transactions, obligations and interests with and among its clients.  The actual or perceived failure to adequately address conflicts of interest could affect the willingness of clients to deal with Trustmark, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s businesses"
0,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2015-03-02,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risks, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below.  The occurrence of any one of, or of a combination of, these risk factors could have a material negative effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s profitability depends to a large extent on net interest income, which is the difference between income on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and expense on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.  Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  Trustmark is unable to predict changes in market interest rates, which are affected by many factors beyond Trustmark’s control, including inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, domestic and international events and changes in the United States and other financial markets.  Even in an environment in which the Federal Reserve is signaling intent to raise rates in the future, it is not possible to predict the timing, amount or even direction of any such increase in the coming year.Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2014, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point and 100 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may increase 2.4% and 1.3%, respectively.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2014, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 5.8%. 18Table of ContentsNet interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark's interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below:·In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.·The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge mortgage servicing rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.Trustmark’s business may be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions in general.The economy has continued to show moderate signs of improvement; however, lingering economic concerns remain as a result of the cumulative weight of soft U.S. labor markets, continuation of the recent decline in crude oil prices for an extended period of time, slowing growth in markets in Western Europe, as well as in China and other emerging markets, combined with uncertainty regarding the timing of the anticipated tightening of the monetary policy by the FRB, continued instability of the Russian economy and renewed uncertainty as to the potential of increased financial instability in Greece and, perhaps, in the broader European Union.  The U.S. and European economies and financial markets tend to be closely associated, and therefore significant weakness in Europe would likely dampen domestic growth prospects during 2015. While domestic demand for loans has improved, particularly for commercial loans, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from low rates and sluggish economic growth, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the increasing regulatory expectations created by recent legislation, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying assets, liabilities and revenues and effectively managing the costs of compliance.The FRB has recently signaled its intent to begin increasing interest rates during the second half of 2015; however, the pace at which interest rates will increase remains uncertain.  Low interest rates will continue to place pressure on net interest margins, as older assets continue to mature or default and are replaced with lower-yielding instruments.  In addition, Management must protect against an increased vulnerability to rapidly changing rates in coming years in the event the current low-rate environment is replaced by a more volatile environment, which could increase exposure to reduced revenues from tighter margins. 19Table of Contents Despite recent optimism resulting from stabilization in the housing sector, unemployment data and credit quality improvement, Trustmark does not assume that the uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events: ·Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses.·Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline in value, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.·Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that have made valuation of assets even more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such change, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch.·The price per barrel of crude oil has declined from $98 as of December 31, 2013, to approximately $53 as of December 31, 2014. As of December 31, 2014, energy-related LHFI represented approximately 3.0% of Trustmark’s total LHFI portfolio, and these loans had no adversely rated credits and were all currently performing. Nonetheless, if oil prices remain at low levels for an extended period, Trustmark could experience weaker energy-related loan demand or increased losses within its energy-related LHFI portfolio. It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether recent progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the U.S. (and, indirectly, global) economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations. Trustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, they remain at depressed levels.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the U.S. economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required to, to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Trustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Federal Reserve Discount Window and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.Trustmark is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and possible enforcement and other legal actions.Trustmark, primarily through TNB and certain non-bank subsidiaries, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision, which vests a significant amount of discretion in the various regulatory authorities.  Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not security holders.  These regulations and supervisory guidance affect Trustmark’s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes.  The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes.  Other changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies or supervisory guidance, including changes in interpretation or implementation or statutes, regulations, policies and supervisory guidance, could affect Trustmark in substantial and unpredictable ways.  Such changes could subject Trustmark to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products Trustmark may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things.  Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in enforcement and other legal actions by Federal or state authorities, including criminal and civil penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage.  In this regard, government authorities, including bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement agendas with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.  Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 20Table of ContentsSee the section captioned “Supervision and Regulation” included in Part I. Item 1. - Business, located elsewhere in this report.Trustmark will be subject to increasingly stringent capital and liquidity requirements.On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on the calibration and phase-in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III.  The FRB, OCC, and FDIC issued final rules establishing regulatory capital requirements consistent with Basel III and implementing the capital requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act in July 2013.  The new capital rules require, among other things, a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%, net of regulatory deductions, and establish a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% of common equity to risk-weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital requirement, effectively establishing a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 7%.  In addition, the new capital rules increase the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement from 4% to 6% of risk-weighted assets.  The new capital rules also specify that a bank with a capital conservation buffer that does not exceed 2.5% shall face limitations on capital distributions and bonus payments to executives.The new capital rules also include stringent criteria for capital instruments to qualify as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital.  For instance, the rules effectively disallow newly-issued trust preferred securities to be a component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital.  Trustmark will continue to utilize $60.0 million in trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by the grandfather provision in the new capital rules.Trustmark and TNB were required to comply with the new capital rules beginning January 1, 2015.  Certain of the requirements of the capital rules, such as the capital conservation buffer, will be phased in until January 1, 2019.  Once the new capital requirements are fully phased in, it is expected that Trustmark and TNB will be required to hold a greater amount of capital and a greater amount of common equity than they were previously required to hold.  Management does not expect the new capital rules to have a significant impact on Trustmark or TNB; however, Management will continue to evaluate the impact of the capital rules on Trustmark and TNB as they are phased in.Unfavorable results from ongoing stress test analyses conducted on Trustmark and TNB may adversely affect Trustmark’s ability to approve, declare and pay dividends to shareholders or compete for new business opportunities.Under final rules associated with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB and OCC require Trustmark and TNB to perform periodic stress tests and analysis to evaluate its ability to absorb losses in various economic and financial scenarios.  This stress test analysis uses three economic and financial scenarios generated by the FRB and OCC, including baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios.  Trustmark and TNB are required to make certain assumptions in modeling future performance and must support these assumptions through statistical analysis and observed market behavior where applicable.  Results of the stress tests and analysis performed by Trustmark and TNB must be submitted to the FRB and the OCC annually to be used in the regulators’ analysis.The outcome of the FRB’s analysis of Trustmark’s projected performance (including capital, earnings and balance sheet changes) could hinder Trustmark’s ability to pay cash dividends to shareholders at levels consistent with prior practice, or at all.  The results of the stress tests could also impact future decision making regarding future acquisitions by Trustmark as well as Trustmark’s ability to effectively compete for new business opportunities.Additionally, the FRB and OCC may require Trustmark and TNB to raise additional capital or take other actions, or may impose restrictions on its business, based on the results of the stress tests, including requiring revisions or changes to capital plans.  Trustmark and TNB may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so, or may not be able to do so on favorable terms.  Any such capital raises, if required, may also be dilutive to existing shareholders.There may be risks resulting from the extensive use of models in Trustmark’s business.Trustmark relies on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, assessing potential acquisition opportunities, developing presentations made to market analysts and others, creating loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting losses, assessing capital adequacy, conducting capital stress testing, calculating regulatory capital levels and estimating the fair value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  These models reflect assumptions that may not be accurate, particularly in times of market stress or other unforeseen circumstances.  Even if these assumptions are adequate, the models may prove to be inadequate or inaccurate because of other flaws in their design or their implementation.  If models for determining interest rate risk and asset-liability management are inadequate, Trustmark may incur increased or unexpected losses upon changes in market interest rates or other market measures.  If models for determining probable loan losses are inadequate, the allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to support future charge-offs.  If models to measure the fair value of financial instruments are inadequate, the fair value of such financial instruments may fluctuate unexpectedly or may not accurately reflect what Trustmark could realize upon sale or settlement of such financial instruments.  Any such failure in the analytical or forecasting models could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, financial condition or results of operations. 21Table of ContentsAlso, information Trustmark provides to its regulators based on poorly designed or implemented models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Certain decisions that the regulators make, including those related to capital distributions and dividends to Trustmark’s shareholders, could be adversely affected due to the regulator’s perception that the quality of Trustmark’s models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.Trustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.When Trustmark acquires a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is generally allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2014, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $398.7 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2014 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial condition and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.Trustmark holds a significant amount of other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2014, Trustmark held $98.6 million of other real estate, compared to $111.6 million at December 31, 2013.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s results of operations or financial condition.Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators.  As of December 31, 2014, total gross unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities totaled $14.6 million.  Trustmark may be required to record impairment charges if these investments suffer a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.  If it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred, Trustmark would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a write-off, if any, occurs.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a larger number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale, herein referred to as mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation, loans that do not meet investor guidelines, loans in which the appraisal does not support the value and/or loans obtained through fraud by the borrowers or other third parties.  Generally, putback requests may be made until the loan is paid in full.  However, mortgage loans delivered to FNMA and FHLMC on or after January 1, 2013 are subject to the Lending and Selling Representations and Warranties Framework updated in May 2014, which provides certain instances in which FNMA and FHLMC will not exercise their remedies, including a putback request, for breaches of certain selling representations and warranties, such as payment history and quality control review. 22Table of ContentsTotal mortgage loan servicing putback expense incurred by Trustmark in 2014 was $600 thousand, a decrease of $900 thousand when compared to 2013.  During November 2013, Trustmark finalized its agreement with FNMA (the “Resolution Agreement”) to resolve its existing and future repurchase and make whole obligations (collectively “Repurchase Obligations”) related to mortgage loans originated between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008 and delivered to FNMA.  Under the terms of the Resolution Agreement, Trustmark paid FNMA approximately $3.6 million with respect to the Repurchase Obligations.  Trustmark believes that it was in its best interests to execute the Resolution Agreement in order to bring finality to the loss reimbursement exposure with FNMA for these years and reduce the resources spent on individual file reviews and defending loss reimbursement requests.  The Repurchase Obligations were covered by Trustmark’s existing reserve for mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.  The reserve for mortgage loan servicing putback expenses for FNMA loans in periods not covered by the Resolution Agreement and to other entities totaled $1.2 million at December 31, 2014, which represented 0.02% of total loans serviced for others, compared to $1.1 million, or 0.02%, at December 31, 2013.  If the level of investor repurchase demands increases in the future, this could significantly increase costs and have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks, as well as community banks within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  At this time, major international banks do not compete directly with Trustmark in its markets, although they may do so in the future.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Potential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services, and Trustmark will likely continue to seek to acquire such businesses in the future.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company; exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company; difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company; potential disruption to Trustmark’s business; potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention; the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. 23Table of ContentsThe acquisition of an insured depository institution that fails could significantly adversely affect an affiliated insured depository institution.  Under cross-guarantee provisions of the FDI Act, the FDIC may recoup losses to the DIF by assessing a claim against insured depository institutions under common control for losses caused by the failure of an affiliated insured depository institution.  See the section captioned “Supervision and Regulation—Payment of Dividends and Other Restrictions” included in Part I. Item 1. - Business, located elsewhere in this report.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, defaults and losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.Trustmark is dependent upon communications and information systems to conduct business as such systems are used to manage virtually all aspects of Trustmark’s business.  Trustmark’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information within its computer systems and networks.  Trustmark has taken protective measures, which are continuously monitored and modified as warranted; however, Trustmark’s computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to breaches, unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses or other malicious codes and cyber-attacks that could affect their information system security.  If one or more of these events were to occur, Trustmark’s or its customers’ confidential and other information would be jeopardized, or such an event could cause interruptions or malfunctions in Trustmark’s or its customers’ or counterparties’ operations.  Trustmark may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify its protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures in its computer systems and networks, and Trustmark may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by Trustmark.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business and additional regulatory scrutiny.Security breaches in Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking activities could further expose Trustmark to possible liability and reputational risk.  Any compromise in security could deter customers from using Trustmark’s internet and mobile banking services that involve the transmission of confidential information.  Trustmark relies on standard internet security systems to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data.  These precautions may not protect Trustmark’s systems from compromise or breaches of security, which could result in significant legal liability and significant damage to Trustmark’s reputation and business.Trustmark relies upon certain third-party vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations.  Accordingly, Trustmark’s operations are exposed to the risk that these vendors might not perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or that the security of the third-party vendors’ computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to compromises that could impact information system security.  Trustmark maintains a system of policies and procedures designed to monitor vendor risks.  While Trustmark believes these policies and procedures mitigate risk, the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with applicable contractual arrangements or service level agreements or any compromise in the security of an external vendor’s information systems could be disruptive to Trustmark’s operations, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.  Incorporation of new products and services, such as internet and mobile banking services, may require significant resources and expose Trustmark to additional risks. 24Table of ContentsTrustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC.  The regulators are requiring Trustmark to enhance its due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  As a result, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include:·actual or anticipated variations in earnings;·changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;·operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;·perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole;·significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;·changes in government regulation;·failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and·volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition or results of operations.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations"
6,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2014-02-24,"ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below.  The occurrence of any one of, or of a combination of, these risk factors could have a material negative effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Risks related to Trustmark’s Industry and BusinessTrustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk.Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  For the year ended December 31, 2013, Trustmark’s total interest income was $414.3 million while net interest income was approximately $388.5 million.  Total interest income and net interest income were higher when compared with 2012, and the impact of interest rate risk improved as Trustmark was able to secure more core deposits, which are a less sensitive funding source, during the year.Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using static balances at December 31, 2013, estimated that in the event of a hypothetical 200 basis point and 100 basis point increase in interest rates, net interest income may increase 3.1% and 1.3%, respectively.  In the event of a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates using static balances at December 31, 2013, it is estimated net interest income may decrease by 4.5%.16Table of ContentsNet interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark's interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below:·In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.·The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, fixed-rate loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times.  For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points.Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s investment, funding and hedging strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.The current low-interest-rate, slow-growth economic environment is inhibiting potential lending and economic growth, which could increase business risks for Trustmark.The impending passage of a two-year budget agreement in the U.S., which reportedly excludes large tax increases or spending cuts, Europe’s reported emergence from its economic recession, and strengthening business and consumer confidence have increased optimism for economic improvements during 2014.  However, lingering economic concerns resulting from the cumulative weight of soft U.S. labor markets, slowing growth in emerging markets and uncertainty resulting from the timing and implementation by the Federal Reserve Board of its tapering of its quantitative easing program remain.  The U.S. and European economies and financial markets tend to be closely associated, and therefore significant weakness in Europe would likely dampen domestic growth prospects during 2014. While domestic demand for loans has improved, particularly for commercial loans, further meaningful gains will depend on sustained economic growth.  Washington’s impending passage of a two-year budget agreement has increased both businesses and consumers’ confidence for economic growth during 2014.  However, even with the legislative actions taken, the potential drag on economic growth due to continued government deficit reductions in 2014 may only be mitigated and not eliminated.  Strategic risk, including threats to business models from low rates, sluggish economic growth and the historic volume of new banking regulations, remains high.  Management’s ability to plan, prioritize and allocate resources in this new environment will be critical to Trustmark’s ability to sustain earnings that will attract capital.  Because of the increasing regulatory expectations created by recent legislation, Management will continue to be challenged in identifying alternative sources of revenue, prudently diversifying balance sheets and revenues and effectively managing the costs of compliance.17Table of ContentsLow interest rates seem likely to persist for some time, keeping pressure on net interest margins, as older assets continue to mature or default and are replaced with lower-yielding instruments.  In addition, Management must protect against an increased vulnerability to rapidly changing rates in coming years in the event the current low-rate environment is replaced by a more volatile environment, which would increase exposure to reduced revenues from tighter margins.Despite recent optimism resulting from stabilization in the housing sector and credit quality improvement, Trustmark does not assume that the uncertain conditions in the economy will improve significantly in the near future.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events:·Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses.·Loan performance could experience a significantly extended deterioration or loan default levels could accelerate, foreclosure activity could significantly increase, or Trustmark’s assets (including loans and investment securities) could materially decline, any one of which, or any combination of more than one of which, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.·Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected by market disruptions that have made valuation of assets even more difficult and subjective.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such change, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch.It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist or whether that progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the U.S. economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations.There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  While the housing and real estate markets have shown continued improvement, they remain at depressed levels.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the U.S. economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect, or be required to, to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Trustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ or when assets cannot be liquidated at fair market value as needed.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, the Federal Reserve Discount Window and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Board and the FHLB of Dallas that are secured by loans and investment securities.  Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.18Table of ContentsThe Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry could materially affect Trustmark’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or the market price of Trustmark’s Common Stock.On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which significantly reforms the regulatory structure relating to the financial services industry.  The legislation, among other things, established the CFPB, which has broad authority to regulate providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services; narrows the scope of federal preemption of state consumer finance laws relating to national banks and operating subsidiaries of national banks, and may expand the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions against national banks to enforce federal consumer protection legislation.  The Dodd-Frank Act also more comprehensively regulates the over-the-counter derivatives market, including providing for more strict capital and margin requirements and central clearing of certain standardized derivatives; strengthens restrictions on lending limits and transactions with affiliates imposed by the National Bank Act; and restricts the interchange fees payable on electronic debit card transactions.  Much of the legislative import of the Dodd-Frank Act is delegated to a variety of federal regulatory agencies, which are required to enact rules to implement various statutory mandates in the Act.As the Dodd-Frank Act continues to turn into specific regulatory requirements, there will be further business impacts across a myriad of industries, not just banking.  Some of those impacts are readily anticipated, such as the change to interchange fees, which is described in the State Laws and Other Federal Oversight section in Item 1 – Business of this report.  However, other impacts are subtle and are not yet capable of precise quantification.  Many of these more subtle impacts will likely only emerge after months and perhaps years of further analysis and evaluation.  In addition, certain provisions that affect deposit insurance assessments, payment of interest on demand deposits and interchange fees could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate.  Finally, implementation of certain significant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to occur over a multi-year period.  Because aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years, it is difficult to anticipate the potential impact on Trustmark and its customers.  It is clear, however, that the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act will continue to require Management to invest significant time and resources to evaluate the potential impact of this Act.The Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by the various federal regulatory agencies, along with other regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry, could materially affect Trustmark’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or the market price of Trustmark’s common stock.  Management is unable to completely evaluate these potential effects at this time.  It is also possible that these measures could adversely affect the creditworthiness of counterparties, which could increase Trustmark’s risk profile.Trustmark may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.On September 12, 2010, the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision, the oversight body of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, announced agreement on the calibration and phase-in arrangements for a strengthened set of capital requirements, known as Basel III.  On June 7, 2012, the Federal Reserve Board, OCC, and FDIC jointly proposed new capital requirements that were consistent with Basel III and implemented the capital requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act.  The new final rule revising regulatory capital requirements was issued by the Federal Reserve Board on July 2, 2013, and approved by the FDIC and the OCC on July 9, 2013.  The new final rules require, among other things, a minimum common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5 percent, net of regulatory deductions, and establish a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5 percent of common equity to risk-weighted assets above the regulatory minimum capital requirement, effectively establishing a minimum common equity Tier 1 ratio of 7 percent.  In addition, the new final rules increase the minimum Tier 1 capital requirement from 4 percent to 6 percent of risk-weighted assets.  The new final rules also specify that a bank with a capital conservation buffer of less than 2.5 percent would potentially face limitations on capital distributions and bonus payments to executives.The Dodd-Frank Act created the Financial Stability Oversight Council that is expected to recommend to the Federal Reserve Board increasingly strict rules for capital requirements as companies grow in size and complexity and that applies the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to most bank holding companies.  These recommendations may remove trust preferred securities as a permitted component of a holding company’s Tier 1 capital, consistent with the federal bank regulatory agencies’ new final capital rules.  Trustmark will continue to utilize $60.0 million in trust preferred securities issued by the Trust as Tier 1 capital up to the regulatory limit, as permitted by the grandfather provision in the Dodd-Frank Act and the Basel III Final Rule.  These recommendations, and any other new regulations, could adversely affect Trustmark’s ability to pay dividends, or could require Trustmark to reduce business levels or to raise capital, including in ways that may adversely affect its results of operations or financial condition.Most banking organizations will be required to apply the new capital rules on January 1, 2015.  It is expected that banking organizations subject to the new final capital rules, including Trustmark, will be required to hold a greater amount of capital and a greater amount of common equity than they are currently required to hold.  Management is currently evaluating the impact the new final capital rules will have on Trustmark.19Table of ContentsTrustmark could be required to write down goodwill and other intangible assets.When Trustmark acquires a business, a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition is generally allocated to goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets.  The amount of the purchase price that is allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets is determined by the excess of the purchase price over the net identifiable assets acquired.  At December 31, 2013, goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets were $414.8 million.  Under current accounting standards, if Trustmark determines goodwill or intangible assets are impaired, Trustmark would be required to write down the carrying value of these assets.  Trustmark’s annual goodwill impairment evaluation performed during the fourth quarter of 2013 indicated no impairment of goodwill for any reporting segment.  Management cannot provide assurance, however, that Trustmark will not be required to take an impairment charge in the future.  Any impairment charge would have an adverse effect on Trustmark’s shareholders’ equity and financial results and could cause a decline in Trustmark’s stock price.Trustmark holds a significant amount of other real estate and may acquire and hold significant additional amounts, which could lead to increased operating expenses and vulnerability to additional declines in real property values.As business necessitates, Trustmark forecloses on and takes title to real estate serving as collateral for loans.  At December 31, 2013, Trustmark held $111.6 million of other real estate, compared to $83.9 million at December 31, 2012.  The amount of other real estate held by Trustmark may increase in the future as a result of, among other things, business combinations, increased uncertainties in the housing market or increased levels of credit stress in residential real estate loan portfolios.  Increased other real estate balances could lead to greater expenses as Trustmark incurs costs to manage, maintain and dispose of real properties.  As a result, Trustmark’s earnings could be negatively affected by various expenses associated with other real estate owned, including personnel costs, insurance and taxes, completion and repair costs, valuation adjustments and other expenses associated with real property ownership, as well as by the funding costs associated with other real estate assets.  The expenses associated with holding a significant amount of other real estate could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s results of operations and financial condition.Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities.  In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators.  As of December 31, 2013, total gross unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities totaled $47.8 million.  Trustmark may be required to record impairment charges if these investments suffer a decline in value that is other-than-temporary.  If it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred, Trustmark would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a write-off, if any, occurs.If Trustmark is required to repurchase a larger number of mortgage loans that it had previously sold, such repurchases could negatively affect earnings.One of Trustmark’s primary business operations is mortgage banking under which residential mortgage loans are sold in the secondary market under agreements that contain representations and warranties related to, among other things, the origination and characteristics of the mortgage loans.  Trustmark may be required to either repurchase the outstanding principal balance of a loan or make the purchaser whole for the economic benefits of a loan if it is determined that the loan sold was in violation of representations or warranties made by Trustmark at the time of the sale.  Such representations and warranties typically include those made regarding loans that had missing or insufficient file documentation and/or loans obtained through fraud by borrowers or other third parties.  Total mortgage loan servicing putback expense incurred by Trustmark in 2013 was $1.5 million, a decrease of $6.4 million when compared to 2012.  At December 31, 2013, the reserve for mortgage loan servicing putback expense was $1.1 million, which represented 0.02% of total loans serviced for others, compared to $7.8 million, or 0.2%, at December 31, 2012.  If the level of investor repurchase demands increase in the future, this could significantly increase costs and have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s results of operations.During November 2013, Trustmark finalized its agreement with FNMA (the “Resolution Agreement”) to resolve its existing and future repurchase and make whole obligations (collectively “Repurchase Obligations”) related to mortgage loans originated between January 1, 2000 and December 31, 2008 and delivered to FNMA.  Under the terms of the Resolution Agreement, Trustmark paid FNMA approximately $3.6 million with respect to the Repurchase Obligations.  Trustmark believes that it was in its best interests to execute the Resolution Agreement in order to bring finality to the loss reimbursement exposure with FNMA for these years and reduce the resources spent on individual file reviews and defending loss reimbursement requests.  The Repurchase Obligations were covered by Trustmark’s existing reserve for mortgage loan servicing putback expenses.20Table of ContentsTrustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry.Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks, as well as community banks within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  At this time, major international banks do not compete directly with Trustmark in its markets, although they may do so in the future.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures.  Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s growth and profitability.Potential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value.Trustmark seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services, and Trustmark will likely continue to seek to acquire such businesses in the future.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company; exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company; difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company; potential disruption to Trustmark’s business; potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention; the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect Trustmark.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or questions or rumors about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general, could lead to market-wide liquidity problems, defaults and losses by Trustmark and by other institutions.  Trustmark has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose Trustmark to credit risk in the event of default of its counterparty or client.  In addition, Trustmark’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral it holds cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure owed to Trustmark.  Losses related to these credit risks could materially and adversely affect Trustmark’s results of operations.Trustmark may experience disruptions of its operating systems or breaches in its information system security.As is customary in the banking industry, Trustmark is dependent upon automated and non-automated systems to record and process our transaction volume.  This poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors or tampering or manipulation of those systems by employees, customers or outsiders will result in losses.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny or civil litigation and possible financial liability.  Trustmark may also be subject to disruptions of operating systems arising from events that are beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages).  Trustmark is further exposed to the risk that third party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as Trustmark).  These disruptions may interfere with service to customers and result in a financial loss or liability that could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.21Table of ContentsTrustmark must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services.In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management cannot provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.Trustmark’s use of third-party service providers and Trustmark’s other ongoing third-party business relationships are subject to increasing regulatory requirements and attention.Trustmark regularly uses third-party service providers and subcontractors as part of its business.  Trustmark also has substantial ongoing business relationships with partners and other third-parties.  These types of third-party relationships are subject to increasingly demanding regulatory requirements and attention by regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the FDIC.  The regulators are requiring Trustmark to enhance its due diligence, ongoing monitoring and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors and other ongoing third-party business relationships.  Trustmark expects that the regulators will hold Trustmark responsible for deficiencies in its oversight and control of its third-party relationships and in the performance of the parties with which Trustmark has these relationships.  As a result, if the regulators conclude that Trustmark has not exercised adequate oversight and control over third-party service providers and subcontractors or other ongoing third-party business relationships or that such third-parties have not performed appropriately, Trustmark could be subject to enforcement actions, including civil monetary penalties or other administrative or judicial penalties or fines as well as requirements for customer remediation.The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile.The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include:·actual or anticipated variations in earnings;·changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;·operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;·perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole;·significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;·changes in government regulation;·failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and·volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, the potential for breakdowns on electronic trading or other platforms for executing securities transactions, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Alabama, Florida, Mississippi and Texas which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s results of operations.22Table of Contents"

RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below.  The occurrence of any one of, or of a combination of, these risk factors could have a material negative effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.   15TABLE OF CONTENTSTrustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk. Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  For the year ended December 31, 2011, Trustmark’s total interest income was $392.0 million while net interest income was approximately $348.9 million.  Although total interest income and net interest income were lower when compared with 2010, the impact of interest rate risk actually improved as Trustmark was able to secure more core deposits as a less sensitive funding source during the year.Financial simulation models are the primary tools used by Trustmark to measure interest rate exposure.  Using a wide range of scenarios, Management is provided with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates.  Models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Trustmark’s balance sheet.  Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of Trustmark’s balance sheet, resulting from both strategic plans and customer behavior.  In addition, the model incorporates Management’s assumptions and expectations regarding such factors as loan and deposit growth, pricing, prepayment speeds and spreads between interest rates.  Trustmark’s simulation model using balances at December 31, 2011 estimated that in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, there would be a reduction in net interest income of 1.8%.Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to discuss how Trustmark's interest rate risk may be influenced by the various factors shown below:  ·In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently.  ·The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives.  ·Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times. For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the Federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points. Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s funding strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from rapidly changing interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the over-the-counter derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective MSR hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.   16TABLE OF CONTENTSThe U.S. economic recovery is showing early signs of stabilizing, however, challenges surrounding the U.S. fiscal policy, the European debt crisis, and geopolitical risks could negatively impact the U.S. economic recovery, which could increase business risks for Trustmark.Economic growth nearly stalled during the first half of 2011 due to several major global developments, including surging oil prices, supply-chain disruptions resulting from the Japanese tsunami and earthquakes, and the escalation of the European sovereign debt crisis.  However, economic performance gained momentum during the last half of 2011, and the U.S. economy is expected to continue on a course of moderate growth with relatively low inflation in 2012.  The unemployment rate for December 2011 was 8.5% and is expected to remain relatively stable in 2012.  While consumer confidence is expected to remain low, consumer spending is expected to continue the growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2011.  The housing market continued to show signs of improvement throughout 2011 as housing price declines showed signs of easing nationwide and housing starts and sales climbed upward.  However, risks remain that foreclosures could again increase.  Historically low interest rates and strengthening credit for both consumers and businesses is expected to gradually reduce delinquencies and increase consumer and business loan demand during 2012.Despite signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, the economic recovery continues to progress slowly.  Trustmark does not assume that the difficult conditions in the economy and in the financial markets will improve significantly in the near future.  The concern now exists that the future of the recovery could be at risk because the economic backdrop is uncertain and unstable.  Several significant downside risks to the U.S. economy exist, including the European debt crisis, challenges surrounding the U.S. fiscal policy, and geopolitical risks.  Europe is expected to experience a mild recession during 2012, which should not dramatically impact the U.S. economy unless the European financial crisis becomes much more severe.  Trustmark has no direct or indirect exposure to any debt of European sovereign and non-sovereign issuers.  However, Trustmark could be exposed to various market risks as U.S. markets react to the escalation of the European financial crisis as part of the global economy.Record levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus in the United States in 2009 and 2010 failed to produce the expected level of economic growth.  Significant fiscal tightening is expected in 2012, as the expiration of the payroll tax holiday and unemployment benefits programs, which Congress extended for two months at the end of 2011, as well as the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts could result in a drag on income.  Risks that the U.S. sovereign debt rating could be further downgraded also remain as no credible plans to address the U.S. deficit have been developed.  The national presidential election will also affect additional policy actions taken throughout 2012.  These risks could negatively impact the U.S. economic recovery, or force the economy back into recession.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways, including affecting its borrowers’ ability to meet their repayment obligations.  It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist as well as the possibility that progress in the economic recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.  If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the U.S. economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.The economic recession has had adverse effects on Trustmark’s business and these effects could increase in severity and heighten risks for Trustmark in key areas of its business.In addition to the general potential risks to Trustmark posed by the uncertainty of the progress of the economy, noted above, specific issues in the housing market over the past year have negatively affected Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, and could continue to do so.As noted above, economic indicators showed improvement in the U.S. economy during the last half of 2011.  Declines in the national unemployment rate, increased consumer spending, and improved capital expenditures from businesses indicate that the U.S. economy is seeing gradual improvements that are expected to continue in 2012.  Declines in housing prices showed signs of easing nationwide in 2011, but not in all geographic areas.  While improvements were seen in 2011, the unemployment rate remains high and the housing market remains at depressed levels.  These factors continue to add uncertainty to the economic outlook and negatively impact the credit performance of loans in affected markets.  Economic conditions and negative credit performance have resulted in writedowns of asset values by financial institutions, including Trustmark, during this recession period.  Trustmark’s strategic focus to reduce exposure to construction and land development lending as well as successful efforts to manage problem assets resulted in significant improvements in credit quality during 2011.While improvements were seen in economic conditions during 2011, the economic outlook remains uncertain and risks remain that could negatively impact progress in the economy.  As noted above, Trustmark does not assume that the difficult conditions in the economy and in the financial markets will improve significantly in the near future.  A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on Trustmark.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events:   17TABLE OF CONTENTS  ·Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses.  ·Conditions in Trustmark’s markets in Mississippi, Tennessee or Texas, which to date have been less severe than in Trustmark’s Florida market, could worsen.  ·Competition in the industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.  ·The market disruptions have made valuation of assets even more difficult and subjective, and Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such change, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch.Trustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations. There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  As discussed above, the recent economic recession resulted in increases in Trustmark’s loan losses and impaired loans.  While the housing and real estate markets have improved, they remain at depressed levels.  If trends in the housing and real estate markets were to revert or further decline below recession levels, Trustmark may experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if the U.S. economy returns to a recessionary state, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions deteriorate.Trustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered deposits, the Federal Reserve Discount Window and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition.In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the FRB and the FHLB that are secured by loans and investment securities. Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities. In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities, such as the conservatorship of FNMA and FHLMC.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators. As of December 31, 2011, total gross unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities totaled $191 thousand. Trustmark may be required to record impairment charges if these investments suffer a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. If it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred, Trustmark would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than-temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a write-off, if any, occurs.   18TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry could materially affect Trustmark’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or the market price of Trustmark’s Common Stock.On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which significantly reforms the regulatory structure relating to the financial services industry.  The legislation, among other things, establishes a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will have broad authority to regulate providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services; narrows the scope of federal preemption of state consumer finance laws relating to national banks and operating subsidiaries of national banks, and may expand the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions against national banks to enforce federal consumer protection legislation; more comprehensively regulates the over-the-counter derivatives market, including providing for more strict capital and margin requirements and central clearing of certain standardized over-the-counter derivatives; strengthens restrictions on lending limits and transactions with affiliates imposed by the National Bank Act; and restricts the interchange fees payable on electronic debit card transactions.  Much of the legislative import of the Dodd-Frank Act is delegated to a variety of federal regulatory agencies, which are required to enact rules to implement various statutory mandates in the Act.  As the Dodd-Frank Act continues to turn into specific regulatory requirements, there will be further business impacts across a myriad of industries, not just banking.  Some of those impacts are readily anticipated, such as the change to interchange fees, which is described in the State Laws and Other Federal Oversight section in Item 1 – Business of this document.  However, other impacts are more difficult to predict and quantify at this time.  For example, provisions that affect deposit insurance assessments and payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the costs associated with deposits as well as place limitations on certain revenues those deposits may generate.  Finally, because many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to further rulemaking and will take effect over several years, it is difficult to anticipate the potential impact on Trustmark and its customers.  It is clear, however, that the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act will require Management to invest significant time and resources to evaluate the potential impact of this Act.  Management will continue to evaluate this impact as more details regarding the implementation of these provisions become available.In addition, in September 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced that its participants had agreed to new international minimum capital standards for banks.  The new agreement, known as Basel III, increases the required minimum capital requirements for banks.  Under Basel III, these requirements will be phased in over an eight year period, subject to rulemaking by the relevant local jurisdiction.  Federal banking regulators have not yet determined how to implement Basel III in the United States, or the timeframe for implementation.  As a result, Management cannot determine the implementation date or the final capital impact Basel III will have on Trustmark.The Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by the regulations currently being promulgated by various federal regulatory agencies, along with other regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry, could materially affect Trustmark’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or the market price of Trustmark’s common stock.  Management is unable to completely evaluate these potential effects at this time.  It is also possible that these measures could adversely affect the creditworthiness of counterparties, which could increase Trustmark’s risk profile.Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry. Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks, as well as community banks within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  At this time, major international banks do not compete directly with Trustmark in its markets, although they may do so in the future.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s growth and profitability.   19TABLE OF CONTENTSThe stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile. The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  Trustmark’s stock price in 2011 was subjected to increased volatility, reflecting the volatility faced by the financial markets in general.  Since January 1, 2011, Trustmark’s stock reached a high of $26.14 per share on January 18, 2011, and a low of $17.06 per share on October 4, 2011.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include:  ·actual or anticipated variations in earnings;  ·changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;  ·operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;  ·perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole;  ·significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;  ·changes in government regulation;  ·failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions; and  ·volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Potential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value. Trustmark seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services, and Trustmark will likely continue to seek to acquire such businesses in the future.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company; exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company; difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company; potential disruption to Trustmark’s business; potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention; the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations. Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to U.S. GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark is exposed to operational, reputational and regulatory risk and must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services.As is customary in the banking industry, Trustmark is dependent upon automated and non-automated systems to record and process our transaction volume.  This poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors or tampering or manipulation of those systems by employees, customers or outsiders will result in losses.  Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny or civil litigation and possible financial liability.  Trustmark may also be subject to disruptions of operating systems arising from events that are beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages).  Trustmark is further exposed to the risk that third party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as Trustmark).  These disruptions may interfere with service to customers and result in a financial loss or liability that could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.  In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies.  Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects.  Management can not provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.   20TABLE OF CONTENTSNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf Coast regions of Texas, Mississippi and Florida which are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  As reported in previous filings, Hurricane Katrina had a catastrophic effect on Trustmark’s Mississippi market, and in late summer 2008, Hurricane Gustav threatened to create a similar result in the Houston metropolitan area, which is the location of Trustmark’s Texas operations.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark"
4,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2011-02-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSTrustmark and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties, which are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution, Trustmark has significant exposure to market risk, including interest rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk.  This section includes a description of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by Management that could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, in particular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Management currently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by the risk factors that are identified below.  The occurrence of any one of, or of a combination of, these risk factors could have a material negative effect on Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations.Trustmark’s largest source of revenue (net interest income) is subject to interest rate risk. Trustmark is exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and deposit taking, since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change.  For the year ended December 31, 2010, Trustmark’s total interest income was $408.2 million while net interest income was approximately $352.0 million.  Trustmark’s simulation model using balances at December 31, 2010 estimated that in the event of a 200 basis point increase in interest rates, there would be a reduction in net interest income of 3.2%.  Net interest income is Trustmark’s largest revenue source, and it is important to understand how Trustmark is subject to interest rate risk.   15  Table of Contents ·  In general, for a given change in interest rates, the amount of the change in value (positive or negative) is larger for assets and liabilities with longer remaining maturities.  The shape of the yield curve may affect new loan yields, funding costs and investment income differently. ·  The remaining maturity of various assets or liabilities may shorten or lengthen as payment behavior changes in response to changes in interest rates.  For example, if interest rates decline sharply, loans may pre-pay, or pay down, faster than anticipated, thus reducing future cash flows and interest income.  Conversely, if interest rates increase, depositors may cash in their certificates of deposit prior to term (notwithstanding any applicable early withdrawal penalties) or otherwise reduce their deposits to pursue higher yielding investment alternatives. ·  Repricing frequencies and maturity profiles for assets and liabilities may occur at different times. For example, in a falling rate environment, if assets reprice faster than liabilities, there will be an initial decline in earnings.  Moreover, if assets and liabilities reprice at the same time, they may not be by the same increment.  For instance, if the Federal funds rate increased 50 basis points, rates on demand deposits may rise by 10 basis points, whereas rates on prime-based loans will instantly rise 50 basis points. ·  Trustmark is likely to face increased regulation of its industry.  Compliance with such regulation may increase its costs and limit its ability to pursue business opportunities. Financial instruments do not respond in a parallel fashion to rising or falling interest rates.  This causes asymmetry in the magnitude of changes in net interest income, net economic value and investment income resulting from the hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates.  Therefore, Management monitors interest rate risk and adjusts Trustmark’s funding strategies to mitigate adverse effects of interest rate shifts on Trustmark’s balance sheet.Trustmark utilizes derivative contracts to hedge Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair value resulting from rapidly changing interest rate environments.  In spite of Trustmark’s due diligence in regard to these hedging strategies, significant risks are involved that, if realized, may prove such strategies to be ineffective, which could adversely affect results of operations.  Risks associated with these strategies include the risk that counterparties in any such derivative and other hedging transactions may not perform; the risk that these hedging strategies rely on Management’s assumptions and projections regarding these assets and general market factors, including prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape of the yield curve, and that these assumptions and projections may prove to be incorrect; the risk that these hedging strategies do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other forecasted inputs to the hedging model; and the risk that the models used to forecast the effectiveness of hedging instruments may project expectations that differ from actual results.  In addition, increased regulation of the over-the-counter derivative markets may increase the cost to Trustmark to implement and maintain an effective MSR hedging strategy.Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income and investment income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.  Trustmark makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk.The economic recovery is fragile at this time, and if monetary and fiscal policy measures fail to have their intended effect, the economy could further weaken, which could increase business risks for Trustmark.The capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption during the last two years.  Despite signs of improvement in the U.S. economy, the economic recovery continues to progress slowly and uncertainly.  Consumer confidence remains low, unemployment remains high at 9.0% for January 2011, and the housing market remains an important downside risk, with prices expected to fall through much of 2011.  Given the concerns about the U.S. economy, employers have continued to approach hiring with caution, and as a result, unemployment is expected to be, at best, only slightly lower in 2011.  Furthermore, record levels of monetary and fiscal stimulus in 2010 have failed to produce the expected level of economic growth.  Trustmark does not assume that the difficult conditions in the economy and in the financial markets generally, and in particular in the Florida market, will improve significantly in the near future.  The concern now exists that the future of the recovery is at risk because the economic backdrop is uncertain and unstable.  Monetary and fiscal policy measures of the federal government may be insufficient to strengthen the recovery and restore stability to the financial markets.  If efforts to revive the economy fail, the U.S. could face prolonged economic uncertainty, and perhaps a double dip recession or deflation, or both.  A further weakened economy could affect Trustmark in a variety of substantial and unpredictable ways, including affecting its borrowers’ ability to meet their repayment obligations.  It is difficult to predict the extent to which these challenging economic conditions will persist, as well as the possibility that signs of a nascent recovery will instead shift to the potential for further decline.   If the economy does weaken in the future, it is uncertain how Trustmark’s business would be affected and whether Trustmark would be able successfully to mitigate any such effects on its business.  Accordingly, these factors in the U.S. economy could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  16  Table of Contents The economic recession has had adverse effects on Trustmark’s business in the past two years, particularly in its Florida loan market, and these effects could increase in severity and heighten risks for Trustmark in key areas of its business.In addition to the general potential risks to Trustmark posed by the uncertainty of the progress of the economy, noted above, specific issues in the housing market over the past year have negatively affected Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, and could continue to do so.The recent anemic improvement in home prices, along with prolonged losses of jobs, have continued to add uncertainty to the employment outlook and have negatively impacted the credit performance of loans in affected markets.  This has resulted in writedowns of asset values by financial institutions, including Trustmark.  For example, in Trustmark’s Florida market, which is the market in which Trustmark has experienced the greatest impact from the economic recession, at December 31, 2010, $139.5 million in aggregate principal amount of loans, or 31.4% of total Florida loans of $444.5 million, were classified as criticized, meaning that those loans exhibit potential credit weaknesses.  Of those loans, approximately $42.0 million in aggregate principal amount were classified as impaired, and determined to be collateral dependent, and that Trustmark charges off the full difference between the loan value and the net realizable value of the underlying collateral.  For Trustmark, nonaccrual loans increased $1.8 million between December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2010, or 1.2%, to total $142.9 million at December 31, 2010.   Trustmark’s total nonperforming assets amounted to approximately $229.6 million at December 31, 2010, a decrease of $1.6 million when compared to December 31, 2009 and an increase of $77.0 million when compared to December 31, 2008.As noted above, Trustmark does not assume that the difficult conditions in the economy and in the financial markets generally, and in particular in the Florida market, will improve significantly in the near future.  A worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on Trustmark.  In particular, Trustmark may face the following risks in connection with these events:·  Market developments and the resulting economic pressure on consumers may affect consumer confidence levels and may cause increases in delinquencies and default rates, which, among other effects, could further affect Trustmark’s charge-offs and provision for loan losses.·  Conditions in Trustmark’s markets in Mississippi, Tennessee or Texas, which to date have been less severe than in Trustmark’s Florida market, could worsen.·  Competition in the industry could intensify as a result of the increasing consolidation of financial services companies in connection with current market conditions.·  The market disruptions have made valuation of assets even more difficult and subjective, and Management’s ability to measure the fair value of Trustmark’s assets could be adversely affected.  If Management determines that a significant portion of its assets have values that are significantly below their recorded carrying value, Trustmark could recognize a material charge to earnings in the quarter during which such determination was made, Trustmark’s capital ratios would be adversely affected by any such change, and a rating agency might downgrade Trustmark’s credit rating or put Trustmark on credit watch.Trustmark is subject to lending risk, which could impact the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and results of operations. There are inherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  As discussed above, the current economic environment resulted in increases in Trustmark’s loan losses and impaired loans.  If current trends in the housing and real estate markets continue, Trustmark may continue to experience higher than normal delinquencies and credit losses.  Moreover, if a prolonged recession occurs, Management expects that it could severely affect economic conditions in Trustmark’s market areas and that Trustmark could experience significantly higher delinquencies and credit losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based on judgments different from those of Management.  As a result, Trustmark may elect to make further increases in its provision for loan losses in the future, particularly if economic conditions continue to deteriorate. Trustmark is subject to liquidity risk, which could disrupt its ability to meet its financial obligations.Liquidity refers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demand for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs and other corporate purposes.  Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.  Trustmark obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokered deposits, the Federal Reserve Discount Window and Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances.  Any significant restriction or disruption of Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could have a negative effect on Trustmark’s ability to satisfy its current and future financial obligations, which could materially affect Trustmark’s financial condition.  17  Table of Contents In addition to the risk that one or more of the funding sources may become constrained due to market conditions unrelated to Trustmark, there is the risk that Trustmark’s credit profile may decline such that one or more of these funding sources becomes partially or wholly unavailable to Trustmark.Trustmark attempts to quantify such credit event risk by modeling bank specific and systemic scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact.  Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets.  To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available lines of credit with the FRB and the FHLB that are secured by loans and investment securities. Management continuously monitors Trustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies.Declines in asset values may result in impairment charges and adversely affect the value of Trustmark’s investments.Trustmark maintains an investment portfolio that includes, among other asset classes, obligations of states and municipalities, agency debt securities and agency mortgage-related securities.  As of December 31, 2010, Trustmark had approximately $2.2 billion of securities available for sale and $140.8 million of securities held to maturity.  Trustmark may be required to record mark-to-market adjustments on these investment securities from time to time. The market value of investments in Trustmark’s investment portfolio may be affected by factors other than interest rates or the underlying performance of the issuer of the securities, such as ratings downgrades, adverse changes in the business climate and a lack of pricing information or liquidity in the secondary market for certain investment securities. In addition, government involvement or intervention in the financial markets or the lack thereof or market perceptions regarding the existence or absence of such activities could affect the market and the market prices for these securities, such as the conservatorship of FNMA and FHLMC.On a quarterly basis, Trustmark evaluates investments and other assets for impairment indicators. As of December 31, 2010, total gross unrealized losses on temporarily impaired securities totaled $15.9 million. Trustmark may be required to record impairment charges if these investments suffer a decline in value that is other-than-temporary. If it is determined that a significant impairment has occurred, Trustmark would be required to charge against earnings the credit-related portion of the other-than temporary impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations in the period in which a write-off, if any, occurs.The effects of the Federal government’s efforts to wind down various programs implemented to support the financial markets cannot be predicted.Unstable economic conditions have resulted in government regulatory agencies and political bodies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the financial services industry.  The Federal government has intervened on an unprecedented scale.  Many of these programs are in the process of being unwound, as the government seeks to effect an orderly withdrawal of this support.  The effects of this wind down on Trustmark, or on the markets in which we compete, cannot be predicted.The Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry could materially affect Trustmark’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or the market price of Trustmark’s Common Stock.On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act, which significantly reforms the regulatory structure relating to the financial services industry.  The legislation, among other things, establishes a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will have broad authority to regulate providers of credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services; narrows the scope of federal preemption of state consumer finance laws relating to national banks and operating subsidiaries of national banks, and may expand the authority of state attorneys general to bring actions against national banks to enforce federal consumer protection legislation; more comprehensively regulates the over-the-counter derivatives market, including providing for more strict capital and margin requirements and central clearing of certain standardized over-the-counter derivatives; strengthens restrictions on lending limits and transactions with affiliates imposed by the National Bank Act; and restricts the interchange fees payable on electronic debit card transactions.  Much of the legislative import of the Dodd-Frank Act is delegated to a variety of federal regulatory agencies, which are required to enact rules to implement various statutory mandates in the Act.  This rulemaking is currently in progress, and thus management cannot predict the final impact on Trustmark of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, in September 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision announced that its participants had agreed to new international minimum capital standards for banks.  The new agreement, known as Basel III, increases the required minimum capital requirements for banks.  Under Basel III, these requirements will be phased in over an eight year period, subject to rulemaking by the relevant local jurisdiction.  Federal banking regulators have not yet determined how to implement Basel III in the United States, or the timeframe for implementation.  As a result, Management cannot determine the implementation date or the final capital impact Basel III will have on Trustmark.   18  Table of Contents The Dodd-Frank Act, as implemented by the regulations currently being promulgated by various federal regulatory agencies, along with other regulatory initiatives relating to the financial services industry, could materially affect Trustmark’s results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or the market price of Trustmark’s common stock.  Management is unable to completely evaluate these potential effects at this time.  It is also possible that these measures could adversely affect the creditworthiness of counterparties, which could increase Trustmark’s risk profile. Trustmark operates in a highly competitive financial services industry. Trustmark faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financial resources.  Such competitors primarily include national and regional banks, as well as community banks within the various markets in which Trustmark operates.  At this time, major international banks do not compete directly with Trustmark in its markets, although they may do so in the future.  Trustmark also faces competition from many other types of financial institutions, including savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries.  The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation.Some of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many of Trustmark’s larger competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than Trustmark.Trustmark’s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including: the ability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationships based on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; the ability to continue to expand Trustmark’s market position through organic growth and acquisitions; the scope, relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate at which Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to its competitors; and industry and general economic trends.  Failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position, which could adversely affect Trustmark’s growth and profitability.The stock price of financial institutions, like Trustmark, can be volatile. The volatility in the stock prices of companies in the financial services industry may make it more difficult for shareholders to resell Trustmark common stock at attractive prices in a timely manner.  Trustmark’s stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors, including factors affecting the financial industry as a whole.  Trustmark’s stock price in 2010 was subjected to increased volatility, reflecting the volatility faced by the financial markets in general.  Since January 1, 2010, Trustmark’s stock reached a high of $26.88 per share on April 23, 2010 and a low of $18.83 per share on August 25, 2010.  The factors affecting financial stocks generally and Trustmark’s stock price in particular include:·  actual or anticipated variations in earnings;·  changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections;·  operating and stock performance of other companies deemed to be peers;·  perception in the marketplace regarding Trustmark, its competitors and/or the industry as a whole;·  significant acquisitions or business combinations involving Trustmark or its competitors;·  changes in government regulation;·  failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions and;·  volatility affecting the financial markets in general.General market fluctuations, industry factors and general economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stock price to decrease regardless of operating results.Potential acquisitions by Trustmark may disrupt Trustmark’s business and dilute shareholder value. Trustmark seeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and have experienced management and possess either significant market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management, economies of scale or expanded services, and Trustmark will likely continue to seek to acquire such businesses in the future.  Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company; exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company; difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company; potential disruption to Trustmark’s business; potential diversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention; the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company; difficulty in estimating the value of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company.  Acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income per share of common stock may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue projections, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results of operations.  19  Table of Contents Changes in accounting standards may affect how Trustmark reports its financial condition and results of operations. Trustmark’s accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) changes the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of Trustmark’s financial statements.  The ongoing economic recession has resulted in increased scrutiny of accounting standards by regulators and legislators, particularly as they relate to fair value accounting principles.  In addition, ongoing efforts to achieve convergence between U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and International Financial Reporting Standards may result in changes to U.S. GAAP.  Any such changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how Trustmark records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.Trustmark is exposed to operational, reputational and regulatory risk and must utilize new technologies to deliver its products and services.As is customary in the banking industry, Trustmark is dependent upon automated and non-automated systems to record and process our transaction volume. This poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors or tampering or manipulation of those systems by employees, customers or outsiders will result in losses. Any such losses, which may be difficult to detect, could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the occurrence of such a loss could expose Trustmark to reputational risk, the loss of customer business, additional regulatory scrutiny or civil litigation and possible financial liability. Trustmark may also be subject to disruptions of operating systems arising from events that are beyond our control (for example, computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages). Trustmark is further exposed to the risk that third party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations (or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors as Trustmark). These disruptions may interfere with service to customers and result in a financial loss or liability that could adversely affect Trustmark’s financial condition or results of operations. In order to deliver new products and services and to improve the productivity of existing products and services, the banking industry relies on rapidly evolving technologies. Trustmark’s ability to effectively utilize new technologies to address customer needs and create operating efficiencies could materially affect future prospects. Management can not provide any assurances that Trustmark will be successful in utilizing such new technologies.Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on Trustmark’s business.Many of Trustmark’s loans are secured by property or are made to businesses in or near the Gulf coast regions of Texas, Mississippi and Florida, which regions are often in the path of seasonal hurricanes.  As reported in previous filings, Hurricane Katrina had a catastrophic effect on Trustmark’s Mississippi market, and in late summer 2008, Hurricane Gustav threatened to create a similar result in the Houston metropolitan area, which is the location of Trustmark’s Texas operations.  Natural disasters, such as hurricanes, could have a significant negative impact on the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing loans, and could cause Trustmark to incur material additional expenses.  Although Management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures, the occurrence of a natural disaster, especially if any applicable insurance coverage is not adequate to enable Trustmark’s borrowers to recover from the effects of the event, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark"
12,TRMK,TRUSTMARK CORP,2008-02-29,"ITEM 1A.   RISKFACTORSTrustmarkand its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks anduncertainties, which are difficult to predict. As a financial institution,Trustmark has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk,liquidity risk and credit risk, among others. This section includes adescription of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified byManagement that are difficult to predict and that could materially affectTrustmark’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the valueof Trustmark’s financial instruments in general, and Trustmark common stock, inparticular.  Additional risks and uncertainties that Managementcurrently deems immaterial or is unaware of may also impair Trustmark’s businessoperations.  This report is qualified in its entirety by these riskfactors.Trustmarkis Subject to Interest Rate RiskTrustmarkis exposed to interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending anddeposit taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and bydifferent amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income,which represents the largest revenue source for Trustmark, is subject to theeffects of changing interest rates. Trustmark closely monitors the sensitivityof net interest income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit thevariability of net interest income as interest rates change. Trustmark makes useof both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure tointerest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such risk include, but are notlimited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products, modifying thecomposition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other financialinstruments used for interest rate risk managementpurposes.  Trustmark has entered into derivative contracts to hedgeour Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) in order to offset changes in fair valueresulting from rapidly changing interest rate environments.  In spiteof Trustmark’s due diligence in regards to these hedging strategies, significantrisk are involved that, if realized, may prove our strategies to be ineffectiveand our results of operations adversely impacted.  Risks associatedwith this strategy include the risk that our hedging strategies are susceptibleto prepayment risk, basis risk, market volatility and changes in the shape ofthe yield curve; the risk that our hedging strategies rely on our assumptionsand projections regarding these assets and general market factors and thatassumptions may prove to be incorrect; the risk that our hedging strategies donot adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepaymentspeeds; the risk that the valuation of MSR based on certain circumstances andassumptions will not be realized due to differences in forecasted inputs withinthe model and the actual results and the risk that the models used to forecasthedge instruments may project expectations that differ from actualresults.Trustmarkis Subject to Lending RiskThere areinherent risks associated with Trustmark’s lending activities.  Therisks include, among other things, the impact of changes in the economicconditions in the markets where Trustmark operates as well as those across theUnited States.  Weakening economic conditions could adversely impactthe ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of collateralsecuring these loans.  As of December 31, 2007, approximately 53% ofTrustmark’s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial: construction,land development and other land loans; and loans secured by nonfarm,nonresidential properties.  These types of loans are also typicallylarger than residential real estate and consumer loans.  BecauseTrustmark’s loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial andindustrial, construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively largebalances, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause asignificant increase in nonperforming loans.  An increase innonperforming loans could result in a net loss in earnings from these loans, anincrease in the provision for possible loan losses and an increase in loancharge-offs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’sfinancial condition and results of operations.To helpmanage credit risk, Trustmark maintains a detailed credit policy and utilizesvarious committees that include members of senior management to approvesignificant extensions of credit. Trustmark also maintains a credit reviewdepartment that regularly reviews Trustmark’s loan portfolios to ensurecompliance with established credit policy. Trustmark maintains an allowance forcredit losses that in Management’s judgment is adequate to absorb lossesinherent in the loan portfolio.Trustmark’sAllowance for Loan Losses May Not Be Adequate to Cover CreditLossesTheallowance for loan losses is established through provisions for estimated loanlosses charged against earnings.  The allowance for loan losses ismaintained at a level believed adequate by management, based on estimatedprobable losses within the existing loan portfolio.  This evaluationis inherently subjective, as it requires material estimates, including theamounts and timing of future cash flows expected to be received on impairedloans that may be susceptible to significant change. Changes in economicconditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans,identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within andoutside of Trustmark’s control, may require an increase in the allowance forloan losses.  In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodicallyreview Trustmark’s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in theprovision for loan losses or the recognition of further charge-offs, based onjudgments different than those of Management.  In addition, ifcharge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, Trustmarkwill need additional provisions to increase the allowance for loanlosses.  Any increases in the allowance for loan losses will result ina decrease in net income and, possibly, stockholders’ equity, and may have amaterial adverse affect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results ofoperations. Table of ContentsTrustmarkis Subject to Liquidity RiskLiquidityrefers to Trustmark’s ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquidassets are available to satisfy current and future financial obligations,including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs,and for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturitiesof financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ. Trustmarkobtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesaleborrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold underagreements to repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit and borrowings fromthe Federal Home Loan Bank.  Should Trustmark experience asubstantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, orshould the availability of funding become restricted due to disruption in thefinancial markets, Trustmark’s ability to obtain funding from these or othersources could be negatively impacted. Trustmark attempts to quantify suchcredit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impactresulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels.Trustmark estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on availableunsecured lines of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources andsecuritizable assets. To mitigate such risk, Trustmark maintains available linesof credit with the Federal Reserve Bank and the Federal Home Loan Bank thatare secured by loans and investment securities. Management continuously monitorsTrustmark’s liquidity position for compliance with internal policies andbelieves that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needsin the normal course of business.TrustmarkOperates In A Highly Competitive Industry and Market Area  Trustmarkfaces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety ofdifferent competitors, many of which are larger and may have more financialresources. Such competitors primarily include national, regional, and communitybanks within the various markets Trustmark operates. Additionally, variousout-of-state banks have entered or have announced plans to enter the marketareas in which Trustmark currently operates. Trustmark also faces competitionfrom many other types of financial institutions, including, without limitation,savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurancecompanies, factoring companies and other financial intermediaries. The financialservices industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative,regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks,securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of afinancial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financialservice, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency andunderwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers toentry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and servicestraditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automaticpayment systems. Many of Trustmark’s competitors have fewer regulatoryconstraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size,many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, mayoffer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing forthose products and services than Trustmark can. Trustmark’s ability to competesuccessfully depends on a number of factors, including, among other things: theability to develop, maintain and build upon long-term customer relationshipsbased on top quality service, high ethical standards and safe, sound assets; theability to expand Trustmark’s market position; the scope, relevance and pricingof products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands; the rate atwhich Trustmark introduces new products and services relative to itscompetitors;  customer satisfaction with Trustmark’s level of serviceand  industry and general economic trends. Failure to perform in anyof these areas could significantly weaken Trustmark’s competitive position,which could adversely affect Trustmark’s growth and profitability, which, inturn, could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial conditionand results of operations.Trustmarkis Subject to Extensive Government Regulation and SupervisionTrustmarkis subject to extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing thebanking industry, in particular, and public companies, in general. Many of thoselaws and regulations are described in Part I, Item 1 “Business.”Changes in those laws and regulations, or the degree of Trustmark’s compliancewith those laws and regulations as judged by any of several regulators thatoversee Trustmark, could have a significant effect on Trustmark’s financialcondition and results of operations. Table of ContentsTrustmark’sControls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented  Managementregularly reviews and updates Trustmark’s internal controls, disclosure controlsand procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system ofcontrols, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certainassumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that theobjectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of Trustmark’scontrols and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related tocontrols and procedures could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’sfinancial condition and results of operations.PotentialAcquisitions May Disrupt Trustmark’s Business and Dilute StockholderValue  Trustmarkseeks merger or acquisition partners that are culturally similar and haveexperienced management and possess either significant market presence or havepotential for improved profitability through financial management, economies ofscale or expanded services. Acquiring other banks, businesses, or branchesinvolves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, amongother things: potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of thetarget company; exposure to potential asset quality issues of the targetcompany; difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel ofthe target company; potential disruption to Trustmark’s business; potentialdiversion of Trustmark’s Management’s time and attention; the possible loss ofkey employees and customers of the target company; difficulty in estimating thevalue of the target company and potential changes in banking or tax laws orregulations that may affect the target company.   Acquisitionstypically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and,therefore, some dilution of Trustmark’s tangible book value and net income percommon share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore,failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases ingeographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from anacquisition could have a material adverse effect on Trustmark’s financialcondition and results of operations.TrustmarkContinually Encounters Technological Change  Thefinancial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological changewith frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. Theeffective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financialinstitutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Trustmark’s futuresuccess depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customersby using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customerdemands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in Trustmark’s operations.Many of Trustmark’s competitors have substantially greater resources to investin technological improvements. Trustmark may not be able to effectivelyimplement new technology-driven products and services or be successful inmarketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfullykeep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industrycould have a material adverse impact on Trustmark’s financial condition andresults of operations.Trustmarkis Subject to Claims and LitigationTrustmarkand its subsidiaries are parties to lawsuits and other claims that arise in theordinary course of business.  Some of these lawsuits assert claimsrelated to the lending, collection, servicing, investment, trust and otherbusiness activities, and some of the lawsuits allege substantial claims fordamages.  Whether these claims are founded or unfounded, if suchclaims are not resolved in a manner favorable to Trustmark they may result insignificant financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception ofTrustmark and its banking, wealth management and insurance products and servicesas well as impact customer demand for these products andservices.  Any financial liability or reputation damage could have amaterial adverse effect on Trustmark’s business, which in turn, could have amaterial adverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results ofoperations.NaturalDisasters, Acts of War or Terrorism Could Significantly Impact Trustmark’sBusinessNaturaldisasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could have asignificant impact on Trustmark’s ability to conduct business.  Suchevents could affect the stability of Trustmark’s deposit base, impair of abilityof borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securingloans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or causeTrustmark to incur additional expenses.  For example, during 2005,Hurricane Katrina made landfall and subsequently caused extensive flooding anddestruction along the Mississippi Gulf Coast as well as central andeastern Mississippi.  Operations in several of the communities whereTrustmark does business were disrupted by damage and/or lack of access toTrustmark’s banking facilities.  Other natural disasters, acts of waror terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in thefuture.  Although Management has established disaster recoverypolicies and procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a materialadverse effect on Trustmark’s business, which in turn, could have a materialadverse effect on Trustmark’s financial condition and results ofoperations. Table of Contents Trustmark’sStock Price Can Be VolatileStockprice volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stockwhen you want and at prices you find attractive.  Trustmark’s stockprice can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety offactors.  These factors include: actual or anticipated variations inearnings; changes in analysts’ recommendations or projections; operating andstock performance of other companies deemed to be peers; perception in themarketplace regarding Trustmark and/or its competitors; new technology used, orservices offered, by competitors; significant acquisitions or businesscombinations involving Trustmark or its competitors, changes in governmentregulation and failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefitsfrom acquisitions.  General market fluctuations, industry factors andgeneral economic and political conditions could also cause Trustmark’s stockprice to decrease regardless of operating results.AnInvestment In Trustmark’s Common Stock Is Not An Insured Deposit  Trustmark’scommon stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against lossby the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), any other deposit insurancefund or by any other public or private entity.
