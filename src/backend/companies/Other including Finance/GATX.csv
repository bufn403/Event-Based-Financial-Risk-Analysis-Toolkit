Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Business, Operational and Industry RisksWe depend on continued demand from our customers to lease or use our transportation assets and services at satisfactory rates. A significant decline in customer demand could negatively impact our business and financial performance. Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Customer demand for our transportation assets and services can be adversely affected by various economic and other factors, including: •Prolonged inflation or deflation•High interest rates•Weak macroeconomic conditions and world trade policies•Weak market conditions in our customers’ businesses•Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities •Changes in railroad operations, efficiency, safety, pricing and service offerings, including those related to “precision scheduled railroading” or labor strikes or shortages•Changes in, or disruptions to, supply chains•Availability of pipelines, trucks, and other alternative modes of transportation•Changes in conditions affecting the aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations •Other operational or commercial needs or decisions of our customersDemand for our railcars and other transportation assets is dependent on the strength and growth of our customers’ businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical or fluctuating markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, transportation, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease our transportation assets or to lease them on profitable terms. Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of assets in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive alternatives. In either case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. In addition, demand for transportation assets used to transport certain commodities, including ethanol and other renewable fuels, may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time, while demand for transportation assets used to transport fossil fuels or that directly or indirectly require consumption of fossil fuels for operation may be affected by government policies and mandates with respect to climate change and carbon emissions.The availability and relative cost of alternative modes of transportation and changes in customer transportation preferences also could reduce demand for our assets. For example, technological innovations in the trucking industry and patterns in U.S. economic growth that favor truck over rail could result in a modal shift away from rail and reduce customer demand for our rail assets. Demand 13for our other transportation assets and related services is also influenced by many of the factors discussed above. For example, aircraft spare engine leasing is influenced by airline and lessee profitability, patterns in global air travel, reliability and durability of engine types, world trade policies, geopolitical tensions or conflict, technological advances, and price and other competitive factors. A significant decline in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.In many cases, demand for our transportation assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors could negatively impact demand for our transportation assets held for lease.A significant change in pricing and/or service offerings by North American railroads or poor operating conditions could reduce demand for our rail assets and negatively impact our financial performance.Our North American rail asset leasing business is impacted by the operations of the railroads, particularly the largest rail systems known as the “Class I railroads”, most of which are utilizing some form of major operational transformation under the umbrella term of “precision scheduled railroading” or “PSR”. If PSR results in substantial increases in train velocity or decreases in dwell time for rail assets, the resulting excess supply of railcars and/or locomotives may adversely impact the demand for our rail assets. Alternatively, if PSR results in increased pricing and/or reduced service frequency, safety and quality, the value proposition of rail freight for shippers relative to alternative modes of transportation could be reduced. Apart from PSR, other factors such as adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, labor strikes or shortages, poor service to shippers, other disruptions to railroad operations, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. Each of these cases could reduce demand for our rail assets and decreased fleet utilization due to modal shift away from rail, all of which could negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital, while some of our competitors manufacture railcars for their own leasing businesses. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases or services to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization, and investment volume.A significant decrease in lease renewals of our transportation assets by our customers or a significant increase in the number of compliance-based maintenance events could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.Decreases in customer demand for our transportation assets could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the return of such assets by our customers. Returned transportation assets often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of leased assets requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs.We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our fleet of transportation assets. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the number of maintenance events in any given year. A significant increase in maintenance events or severe constraints in the repair networks may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs as a result of increased volume or the need to utilize higher cost third party maintenance providers. In addition, while we rely on third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures for our transportation assets, high demand faced by these providers from other asset owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.14Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars at reasonable rates, or at all. Furthermore, we may be required to take delivery of railcars at points when our financing costs may be high. These factors could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, if tariffs, labor interruptions or shortages, trade disputes, commodity prices, geopolitical tensions, inflation, supply chain disruptions, or other factors lead to higher prices for steel or other raw materials used to manufacture railcars, we may be required to pay higher prices to purchase new railcars, which could adversely affect our ability to profitably lease those railcars to customers.Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket transportation assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleets, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to segment profit. Reduced demand for our assets could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income. A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance. We may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities, which could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses and costs, assumption of liabilities and indemnities, increased compliance risks, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers or third parties. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses, which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, we will not receive the expected benefits, and alternative favorable opportunities to invest or divest may not be available to us. If we cannot successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, or are unable to complete a divestiture, our financial results could be adversely affected.We rely on Rolls-Royce in connection with our aircraft spare engine leasing businesses, and certain factors that adversely affect Rolls-Royce could have an adverse effect on those businesses.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc. (“Rolls-Royce”) each own 50% of domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates” or “RRPF”) that own and lease aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. In addition, GATX directly invests in Rolls-Royce aircraft spare engines through its wholly owned subsidiary, GATX Engine Leasing Ltd. (“GEL”), and places some of these engines on long-term leases with airline operators, with an RRPF entity serving as the asset manager. For other engines, GEL also provides Rolls-Royce with access to aircraft spare engine capacity to support Rolls-Royce’s engine maintenance program for its customers. Rolls-Royce is therefore a major customer of the RRPF affiliates and of GEL, as well as a critical supplier of aircraft spare engines and commercial, technical, and maintenance services to GATX and the RRPF affiliates. A deterioration in (1) the performance of services provided by Rolls-Royce or RRPF, or (2) the durability and reliability of Rolls-Royce engines, or (3) the financial condition, creditworthiness or liquidity of Rolls-Royce or RRPF could negatively impact GATX’s financial performance or, in the case of GEL, its operational performance.Our transportation assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make transportation assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers’ industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our transportation assets.15Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics, and international tensions and conflicts•Supply chain disruptions•Inability to access railcar, tank container or component supply•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business, or retaliatory sanctions by such countries on companies in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, regulations, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States•Inflation or deflation•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Noncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee baseMany of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. If we fail to negotiate acceptable labor agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We operate in a challenging market for talent, and our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including key management personnel, could adversely impact our ability to execute our strategy.Our success depends on the strength of our workforce (many of whom are longstanding GATX employees) and therefore on our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain employee talent, including successors to members of senior management. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. The market for both hourly and professional employees has been, and remains, very competitive. Difficulties in recruiting and motivating qualified personnel, including skilled labor; the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base; or our inability to successfully transition key roles could hinder our ability to execute our strategy and adversely impact our business and results of operations.16Information Technology RisksWe rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.We rely on our IT Infrastructure (defined below) to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is used in all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. We own and manage certain aspects of our IT infrastructure, but we also rely on third parties for a range of IT systems and related products and services, including but not limited to, cloud computing services (such third-party systems and our IT infrastructure, collectively, our “IT Infrastructure”). We and certain of our third-party providers collect, maintain and process data about customers, employees, business partners and others, including personally identifiable information, as well as confidential and proprietary information belonging to our business, including trade secrets (such data and information, collectively, “Confidential Information”). We face numerous and evolving cybersecurity risks that threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our IT Infrastructure and Confidential Information. These risks have continued to increase in recent years in their frequency and levels of sophistication and intensity by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. The implementation of remote and hybrid work options for our employees and employees of our third-party IT suppliers has led to a substantial increase in remote access to our networks and systems. All IT systems are vulnerable to cybersecurity threats and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems, and these vulnerabilities may be increased by remote computing assets and additional security vulnerabilities that are present in many public, non-corporate and home networks. We and our third-party providers are regularly subject to attempted cyber intrusions, hacks and ransomware attacks, and we expect these incidents to accelerate and become increasingly sophisticated in using techniques and tools - including artificial intelligence - that circumvent security controls, evade detection and remove forensic evidence. While we have invested significant expense and effort in the protection of our Confidential Information and IT Infrastructure, the steps we have taken to mitigate these risks may not be effective to prevent breaches of our IT Infrastructure. Breaches of our IT Infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of Confidential Information stored on our IT Infrastructure and subject us to potential lawsuits, including class actions, other material legal liabilities, reputational damage, lost customers or significant costs associated with incident response, system restoration or remediation, applicable filings and notifications, and future compliance. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations. There can be no assurance that our cybersecurity risk management program and processes, including our policies, controls, or procedures, will be fully implemented, complied with, or effective in protecting our systems and information. While we maintain insurance to mitigate our exposure to these risks, our insurance policies, which carry retention and coverage limits, may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches or other cybersecurity events, and we cannot guarantee that applicable insurance will be available to us in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all.We also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy, data protection and data security. Many jurisdictions in which we conduct business have passed or proposed laws and regulations dealing with the collection, processing, storage, transfer and/or use of personal information, some of which include potential fines and penalties based on worldwide revenue. We could incur substantial costs related to ongoing compliance with, and substantial penalties or litigation or reputational damage related to violations of, such laws and regulations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe have been, and may continue to be, involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars or other transportation assets.The nature of our business and assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the U.S. For example, some of our customers use certain types of our transportation assets to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving such transportation assets could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability. Similarly, if we fail to meet our obligations to maintain our assets in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for such failure as well as any resulting personal injury or property damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. 17Our transportation assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws, rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our fleets of transportation assets and related operations are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business, including the Association of American Railroads. Such laws, rules, and regulations could be changed in ways that would require us to modify our business models and objectives, impose requirements for additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our assets, or otherwise affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Violations of these laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeiture of assets, and reputational damage.We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased asset may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from such asset without regard to the owner’s fault. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate, including environmental laws and regulations, without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects such changes may have on our business. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, and the potential liability for our operations as well as those of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially greater than the costs we have estimated.We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.Regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions has increased across the globe. New government regulations could increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly.  For example, regulators in Europe and the U.S. have recently focused efforts on increased disclosure related to climate change and mitigation efforts. The European Union recently adopted the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) and related European Sustainability Reporting Standards that will require disclosure of the risks and opportunities arising from social and environmental issues and of the impact of companies’ activities on people and the environment. We will be required to report under the CSRD for much of our business beginning in 2026. Similarly, the State of California recently passed the Climate Corporate Data Accountability Act and the Climate-Related Financial Risk Act that will impose broad climate-related disclosure obligations on certain companies doing business in California, including us, starting in 2026, while additional states are considering similar climate-related disclosure regulations. The SEC has included in its regulatory agenda potential rulemaking on climate change that, if adopted, could require us to incur substantial monitoring and compliance costs. All of these new disclosure rules and regulations will require us to design and implement additional internal and disclosure controls. If the cost of such controls is significant, it could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations. Moreover, failure of such controls to provide accurate and complete information could result in violation of such rules or regulations, which could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputationClimate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Severe weather, climate change, and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, flooding, fires and earthquakes, could cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. We are subject to the risks associated with natural disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which may increase in frequency and severity over time and may have a material adverse effect on our assets, operations and business. In addition, changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities or other third parties to address GHG and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on GHG emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy, which could reduce demand for the lease of our assets, while rail and other transportation assets in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, or that directly or indirectly require fossil fuel consumption for operation of the assets could see reduced demand or be rendered obsolete depending on the extent to which government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption or customer preferences change. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could reduce the demand for and value of our assets, and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.18Economic and Credit RisksUnited States and global political conditions and increased geopolitical tension, including the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and resulting sanctions and countermeasures, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks or war, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of transportation assets against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of transportation assets and increase costs•A decrease in demand for transportation assets and services•Lower utilization of transportation equipment•Lower transportation asset lease rates•Impairments and loss of transportation assets•Supply chain challenges and disruptions•Capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets•Increased risk of cybersecurity attacks•A significant deterioration of global growth, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets, arising from political or economic tensions, changes, and trends and/or an increase in trade conflict and protectionism.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.Geopolitical conflicts can also result in the imposition of economic and trade sanctions and countermeasures, and our business must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council and other relevant governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the sanctions, laws and regulations could result in monetary fines or other penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.As an example of one such conflict, in February 2022, Russian military forces launched a military action in Ukraine. In response to this action, the United States and other countries imposed various economic sanctions and measures against Russia, Belarus, certain sections of Ukraine, and related persons and entities. Russia subsequently enacted countermeasures. Additional sanctions and countermeasures have continued to be imposed as the conflict continues. The Russia/Ukraine conflict and related sanctions and countermeasures led to our decision to sell our rail business in Russia, but to date, the conflict has not had a material impact on business operations at our businesses outside of Russia. We continue to closely monitor developments and potential impacts from enacted sanctions and countermeasures and will take mitigating actions as appropriate. This conflict and resulting response have impacted the global economy, financial markets, and supply chains and could continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations, which impacts vary across our business units, including the RRPF affiliates.  We continue to monitor the nature and magnitude of these impacts across our businesses.Prolonged inflation, as well as resulting interest rate increases, or deflation could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions, the magnitude of the inflation and other economic factors. While inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and other transportation assets may benefit our financial results, prolonged inflation could result in reduced demand for our transportation assets. Moreover, any benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, transportation assets or components thereof, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.19In response to inflation, central bank policy interest rates continued to increase in fiscal year 2023. As noted below, rising interest rates could increase our borrowing costs, potentially decreasing our profitability. In addition, increased borrowing costs faced by our customers could also result in decreased demand for our transportation assets and services and have a dampening effect on overall economic activity, which could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk with currency derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets, or negative changes in our credit ratings or continuing increased interest rates may limit our ability to obtain financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and the capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments. Typical funding sources include commercial paper, bank term loans, public debt issuances, and a variety of other secured and unsecured financing structures. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings, Inc., or continuing increased interest rates could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. Financial and market dynamics and volatility may heighten these risks. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.The emergence of new variants of COVID-19 or the occurrence of another widespread health crisis and measures taken in response could have an adverse impact on our operations, commercial activity, asset values, financial position or liquidity.The recent COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted businesses globally, including our business, by causing or contributing to a slowdown in economic activity around the world (including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains, a dramatic reduction in air travel, and volatility and disruption of financial markets.  There were extraordinary actions taken by governmental authorities to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of COVID-19 in regions throughout the world, including travel bans, quarantines, “stay-at-home” orders, and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.  The emergence of new variants of COVID-19 or the occurrence of another widespread health crisis and governmental action taken in response thereto may result in operational and labor disruptions, employee attrition and difficulty securing future labor needs, as well as have impacts on the broader employment market and supply chains, our suppliers, and our customers.  These impacts could materially and adversely affect our costs, operations, financial performance, and liquidity, as well as our ability to successfully execute our business strategy.Risks Related to our Common StockThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.The timing, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders and repurchases of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Board’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future, and our payment of dividends and repurchase of shares could vary from historical practices and our stated expectations.A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.As of the most recent public filings, six shareholders collectively control more than 60% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.20General Risk Factors
We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive or unavailable, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries and in tax rates and laws could adversely affect our financial results.As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax position and related liabilities. Our effective tax rate, cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, or material audit assessments, as well as by changes in the local tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretations thereof.  Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment annually, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets or the commodities that they carry, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types or geographic markets•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived transportation assets such as rail assets, aircraft spare engines and tank containers. The carrying value of these assets on our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.21Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. No system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of material error"
6,GATX,GATX CORP,2023-02-16,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.11Business and Operational RisksThe ongoing military action between Russia and Ukraine could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.On February 24, 2022, Russian military forces launched a military action in Ukraine. Although the length, impact and outcome of the ongoing military conflict in Ukraine is highly unpredictable, this conflict has already led to significant market and other disruptions, including a dramatic increase in energy prices across Europe, extreme volatility in commodity prices and supply of energy resources, instability in financial markets, supply chain challenges and disruptions, slower new railcar deliveries, limited access to key components, increased labor costs, inflationary pressures, political and social instability, as well as an increase in cyberattacks and espionage, any of which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. These disruptions have been more impactful in Europe and India.As a result of the conflict in Ukraine, the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom and other countries have implemented, and may implement additional, sanctions, export controls and other measures against Russia, Belarus and other countries, regions, officials, individuals or industries in their respective territories. Such sanctions and other measures, as well as the existing and potential further responses from Russia or other countries to such sanctions, tensions and military actions, could adversely affect the global economy and financial markets and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.As of December 31, 2022, our rail operations in Russia consisted of a fleet of 380 railcars managed by three employees. In 2022, as a result of our decision to exit Russia, the net assets of this limited railcar leasing business were classified as held for sale and an impairment loss was recognized. On January 31, 2023, we completed the sale of our Russian business and therefore no longer have any operations in Russia. See ""Note 26. Subsequent Events"" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.In the first quarter of 2022, our spare aircraft engine leasing joint ventures with Rolls-Royce plc (“RRPF”) recognized an impairment charge on three engines leased to a Russian airline customer. If the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has a longer-term impact on international air travel, or adversely impacts aircraft spare engine leasing, it is possible that the value of other engines in the RRPF or GATX Engine Leasing Ltd. portfolios may be negatively affected and additional asset impairments may be required, the magnitude of which is unknown.Our business must be conducted in compliance with applicable economic and trade sanctions laws and regulations, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department of State, the U.S. Department of Commerce, the United Nations Security Council and other relevant governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the sanctions, laws and regulations could result in monetary fines or other penalties, which could have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.Any of the above-mentioned factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such disruptions may also magnify the impact of other risks described elsewhere in this report.The global COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken in response to the pandemic may continue to have an adverse impact on our operations, commercial activity, asset values, financial position or liquidity in the future.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including the emergence of new variants) continues to cause disruptions in global supply chains, and recent changes in the Chinese government’s approach to the pandemic may result in greater disruptions and potentially a slowdown of economic activity. Our foreign operations source certain railcar components and tank containers from China, and a delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, such components could adversely impact those operations and our financial performance. In addition, the pandemic caused a dramatic reduction in air travel, which reduced demand for the aircraft spare engines that we and our RRPF affiliates lease, and it is unclear when global air travel will return to pre-pandemic levels. A slow recovery in the market for air travel, particularly the long-haul routes that often utilize wide-body aircraft equipped with the spare engine models that we and our RRPF affiliates predominantly lease, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The duration of, and the situation surrounding, the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences remain uncertain, and the pandemic’s continuing impact on our costs, operations, financial performance, and liquidity, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, is difficult to predict. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited to: actions taken by others in response to the pandemic; impacts on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; inflationary pressures; economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets; and global supply chain disruptions. As a result, we expect 12COVID-19 may continue to negatively impact our operating results in future periods, including by increasing many of the risks described elsewhere in this report. However, we are currently unable to provide any assurance as to the likelihood, magnitude, and duration of any such impact.A significant decrease in lease renewals of our transportation assets by our customers or a significant increase in the number of compliance-based maintenance events could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.Decreases in customer demand for our transportation assets could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the return of such assets by our customers. Returned transportation assets often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of leased assets requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs.We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our fleet of transportation assets. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the number of maintenance events in any given year. A significant increase in maintenance events or severe constraints in the repair networks may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs as a result of increased volume or the need to utilize higher cost third party maintenance providers. In addition, while we rely on third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures for our transportation assets, high demand faced by these providers from other asset owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars at reasonable rates, or at all. Furthermore, we may be required to take delivery of railcars at points when our financing costs may be high. These factors could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, if tariffs, labor interruptions or shortages, trade disputes, commodity prices, geopolitical tensions, inflation, supply chain disruptions, or other factors lead to higher prices for steel or other raw materials used to manufacture railcars, we may be required to pay higher prices to purchase new railcars, which could adversely affect our ability to profitably lease those railcars to customers.Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket transportation assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleets, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to segment profit. Reduced demand for our assets could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income. A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance. We may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities, which could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, 13increased expenses and costs, assumption of liabilities and indemnities, increased compliance risks, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers or third parties. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses, which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, we will not receive the expected benefits, and alternative favorable opportunities to invest or divest may not be available to us. If we cannot successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, or are unable to complete a divestiture, our financial results could be adversely affected.We rely on Rolls-Royce in connection with our aircraft spare engine leasing businesses, and certain factors that adversely affect Rolls-Royce could have an adverse effect on those businesses.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc. (“Rolls-Royce”) each own 50% of domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates” or “RRPF”) that own and lease aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. In addition, GATX directly invests in Rolls-Royce aircraft spare engines through its wholly owned subsidiary, GATX Engine Leasing Ltd. (“GEL”), and places some of these engines on long-term leases with airline operators, with an RRPF entity serving as the asset manager. For other engines, GEL also provides Rolls-Royce with access to aircraft spare engine capacity to support Rolls-Royce’s engine maintenance program for its customers. Rolls-Royce is therefore a major customer of the RRPF affiliates and of GEL, as well as a critical supplier of aircraft spare engines and commercial, technical, and maintenance services to GATX and the RRPF affiliates. While global air travel has improved in recent quarters, Rolls-Royce and RRPF are facing and may continue to face significant adverse financial and operational issues due to the ongoing adverse impact of COVID-19 and the uncertainty surrounding the Russia/Ukraine conflict. A deterioration in (1) the performance of services provided by Rolls-Royce or RRPF, or (2) the durability and reliability of Rolls-Royce engines, or (3) the financial condition, creditworthiness or liquidity of Rolls-Royce or RRPF could negatively impact GATX’s financial performance or, in the case of GEL, its operational performance.We operate in a challenging market for talent, and our failure to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel, including key management personnel, could adversely impact our ability to execute our strategy.Our success depends on the strength of our workforce (many of whom are longstanding GATX employees) and therefore on our ability to attract, develop, engage and retain employee talent, including successors to members of senior management. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, competitors’ hiring practices and the effectiveness of our compensation programs. The market for both hourly and professional employees has been, and remains, very competitive. Difficulties in recruiting and motivating qualified personnel; the unexpected loss of such individuals resulting in the depletion of our institutional knowledge base; or our inability to successfully transition key roles could hinder our ability to execute our strategy and adversely impact our business and results of operations.Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. If we fail to negotiate acceptable labor agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our transportation assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make transportation assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers’ industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our transportation assets.Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. 14Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Inflation or deflation•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Supply chain disruptions•Inability to access railcar, tank container or component supply•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business, or retaliatory sanctions by such countries on U.S. companies•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, regulations, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States•Unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics, and international tensions and conflicts.Information Technology RisksWe rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.Threats to IT systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks have continued to increase in recent years in their frequency and levels of sophistication and intensity by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is used in all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. The implementation of remote and hybrid work options for employees has led to a substantial increase in remote access to our networks and systems. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. We are subject to attempted cyber intrusions, hacks and ransom attacks, and we have had and continue to experience events of this nature and expect them to continue. While we have invested in the protection of our data and IT infrastructure, the steps we have taken to mitigate these risks may not be effective to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties, and we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyber-attack or information security incident from our workforce working remotely. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities or reputational damage. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations. While we maintain insurance to mitigate our exposure to these risks, our insurance policies, which carry retention and coverage limits, may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches or other cybersecurity events, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies.We also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy, data protection and data security. Many states as well as foreign governments have passed or proposed laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their data subjects, including but not limited to the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation or reputational damage related to violations of such laws and regulations.15Legal and Regulatory RisksWe have been, and may continue to be, involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars or other assets.The nature of our business and assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the U.S. For example, some of our customers use certain types of our transportation assets to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving such transportation assets could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability. Similarly, if we fail to meet our obligations to maintain our assets in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for such failure as well as any resulting personal injury or property damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. Our transportation assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws, rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our fleets of transportation assets and related operations are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. Such laws, rules, and regulations could be changed in ways that would require us to modify our business models and objectives, impose requirements for additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our assets, or otherwise affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Violations of these laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeiture of assets, and reputational damage.In addition, proposed SEC rules and other foreign regulations may require us to collect and disclose additional information relating to certain aspects of our operations, such as environmental and climate impacts and cybersecurity events. Adoption of any such rules or regulations could require us to design and implement additional internal and disclosure controls. If the cost of such controls is significant, it could adversely affect our financial condition and result of operations. Moreover, failure of such controls to provide accurate and complete information could result in violation of such rules or regulations, which could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased asset may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from such asset without regard to the owner’s fault. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate, including environmental laws and regulations, without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects such changes may have on our business. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, and the potential liability for our operations as well as those of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially greater than the costs we have estimated.We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Severe weather, climate change, and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, flooding, fires and earthquakes, could cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. We are subject to the risks associated with natural 16disasters and the physical effects of climate change, which may increase in frequency and severity over time and may have a material adverse effect on our assets, operations and business.In addition, changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities or other third parties to address GHG and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on GHG emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy, which could reduce demand for the lease of our assets, while rail and other transportation assets in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, or that directly or indirectly require fossil fuel consumption for operation of the assets could see reduced demand or be rendered obsolete depending on the extent to which government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption or customer preferences change. New government regulations could also increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. For example, the SEC has proposed disclosure requirements that would require companies to disclose a range of climate-related information, which may require us to incur substantial monitoring and compliance costs. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could reduce the demand for and value of our assets, and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Industry RisksWe depend on continued demand from our customers to lease or use our transportation assets and services at satisfactory rates. A significant decline in customer demand could negatively impact our business and financial performance. Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Customer demand for our transportation assets and services can be adversely affected by various economic and other factors, including: •Weak macroeconomic conditions •Weak market conditions in our customers’ businesses•Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities •Changes in railroad operations, efficiency, pricing and service offerings, including those related to “precision scheduled railroading” or labor strikes or shortages•Changes in, or disruptions to, supply chains•Availability of pipelines, trucks, and other alternative modes of transportation•Changes in conditions affecting the aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations •Other operational or commercial needs or decisions of our customers•World trade policiesDemand for our railcars and other transportation assets is dependent on the strength and growth of our customers’ businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical or fluctuating markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, transportation, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease our transportation assets or to lease them on profitable terms. Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of assets in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive alternatives. In either case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. In addition, demand for transportation assets used to transport certain commodities, including ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time, while demand for transportation assets used to transport fossil fuels or that directly or indirectly require consumption of fossil fuels for operation may be affected by government policies and mandates with respect to climate change.The availability and relative cost of alternative modes of transportation and changes in customer transportation preferences also could reduce demand for our assets. For example, technological innovations in the trucking industry and patterns in U.S. economic growth that favor truck over rail could result in a modal shift away from rail and reduce customer demand for our rail assets. Demand for our other transportation assets and related services is also influenced by many of the factors discussed above. For example, aircraft spare engine leasing is influenced by airline and lessee profitability, patterns in global air travel, reliability and durability of engine types, world trade policies, technological advances, and price and other competitive factors. A significant decline in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.17In many cases, demand for our transportation assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors could negatively impact demand for our transportation assets held for lease.A significant change in pricing and/or service offerings by North American railroads or poor operating conditions could reduce demand for our rail assets and negatively impact our financial performance.Our North American rail asset leasing business is impacted by the operations of the railroads, particularly the largest rail systems known as the “Class I railroads”, most of which are pursuing some form of major operational transformation under the umbrella term of “precision scheduled railroading” or “PSR”. If PSR results in substantial increases in train velocity or decreases in dwell time for rail assets, the resulting excess supply of railcars and/or locomotives may adversely impact the demand for our rail assets. Alternatively, if PSR results in increased pricing and/or reduced service frequency and quality, the value proposition of rail freight for shippers relative to alternative modes of transportation could be reduced. Apart from PSR, other factors such as adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, labor strikes or shortages, poor service to shippers, other disruptions to railroad operations, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. Each of these cases could reduce demand for our rail assets and decreased fleet utilization due to modal shift away from rail, all of which could negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital, while some of our competitors manufacture railcars for their own leasing businesses. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases or services to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization, and investment volume.Economic and Credit RisksFluctuations in foreign exchange rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate risk with currency derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets, or negative changes in our credit ratings or increased interest rates may limit our ability to obtain financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and the capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments. Typical funding sources include commercial paper, bank term loans, public debt issuances, and a variety of other secured and unsecured financing structures. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service, and Fitch Ratings, Inc., or increased interest rates could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. Financial and market dynamics and volatility may heighten these risks. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.Inflation or deflation could have an unanticipated adverse impact on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions, the magnitude of the inflation and other economic factors. While inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and other transportation assets 18may benefit our financial results, prolonged inflation could result in reduced demand for our transportation assets. Moreover, any benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, transportation assets or components thereof, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks or war, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of transportation assets against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of transportation assets and increase costs•A decrease in demand for transportation assets and services•Lower utilization of transportation equipment•Lower transportation asset lease and charter rates•Impairments and loss of transportation assets•Supply chain disruptions•Capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A significant deterioration of global growth, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets, arising from political or economic tensions, changes, and trends and/or an increase in trade conflict and protectionism.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material. Risks Related to our Common StockThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.The timing, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders and repurchases of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Board’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future, and our payment of dividends and repurchase of shares could vary from historical practices and our stated expectations.A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.As of the most recent public filings, six shareholders collectively control more than 60% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.19General Risk Factors
Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries and in tax rates and laws could adversely affect our financial results.As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax position and related liabilities. Our effective tax rate, cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, or material audit assessments, as well as by changes in the local tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretations thereof.  Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment annually, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets or the commodities that they carry, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types or geographic markets•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived transportation assets such as rail assets, aircraft spare engines and tank containers. The carrying value of these assets on our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive or unavailable, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.20Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations.

14,GATX,GATX CORP,2022-02-17,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
    Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Business and Operational RisksThe global COVID-19 pandemic had an adverse impact on our businesses and financial performance, and the duration and extent of the pandemic could prolong or increase the adverse impact on some or all of our businesses. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and measures taken in response to the pandemic may adversely affect our personnel, operations, commercial activity, asset values, financial position or liquidity in the future.The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (including the emergence of new variants) has caused, to varying degrees, a slowdown of economic activity around the world (including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains, a dramatic reduction in air travel, and volatility and disruption of financial markets, and we expect that some or all of these impacts may continue for the foreseeable future. Such disruptions resulted in, and may still result in, (i) reduced demand for leasing of certain railcar types and, in particular, for aircraft spare engines, which continue to be adversely impacted, (ii) downward pressure on lease rates and renewals, and in the case of our RRPF affiliates, accommodations of certain requests by customers for payment deferrals and rate restructuring, and (iii) reductions in asset disposition for certain of our segments. We also face ongoing operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety and may continue to encounter ongoing workplace disruptions. Our remote work arrangements for employees pose challenges for those employees and our IT systems, which could strain our business continuity plans, and introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity and IT systems management risks. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid, and financial markets could experience additional disruption or increased volatility attributable to the pandemic, including the emergence of new variants.Jurisdictions in which we operate may adopt vaccine, testing, or other pandemic mitigation requirements and, if such requirements are imposed, they could result in labor disruptions, employee attrition, and difficulty securing future labor needs, as well as have impacts on the broader employment market and the supply chain, our suppliers, and our customers.The duration of, and the situation surrounding, the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing, and difficult to predict, and the pandemic’s impact on our costs, operations, financial performance, and liquidity, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: actions taken by other in response to the pandemic; impacts on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; economic uncertainty and volatility in financial markets; and global supply chain disruptions. As a result, we expect COVID-19 may continue to negatively impact our operating results in future periods, including by increasing many of the risks described below. However, we are currently unable to provide any assurance as to the likelihood, magnitude, and duration of any such impact.12A significant decrease in lease renewals of our transportation assets by our customers or a significant increase in the number of compliance-based maintenance events could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.Decreases in customer demand for our transportation assets could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the return of such assets by our customers. Returned transportation assets often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of leased assets requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs.We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our fleet of transportation assets. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the number of maintenance events in any given year. A significant increase in maintenance events or severe constraints in the repair networks may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs as a result of increased volume or the need to utilize higher cost third party maintenance providers. In addition, while we rely on third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures for our transportation assets, high demand faced by these providers from other asset owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations. We are monitoring the potential conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The situation remains uncertain, and while we do not expect that it would be material to GATX, a conflict in Ukraine or the imposition of sanctions on Russia could result in an adverse impact on certain of our businesses, operations, and assets.Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars at reasonable rates, or at all. Furthermore, we may be required to take delivery of railcars at points when our financing costs may be high. These factors could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, if tariffs, trade disputes, commodity prices, supply chain disruptions, or other factors lead to higher prices for steel or other raw materials used to manufacture railcars, we may be required to pay higher prices to purchase new railcars, which could adversely affect our ability to profitably lease those railcars to customers.Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket transportation assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleets, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to segment profit. Reduced demand for our assets due to adverse market conditions could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income. A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance. We may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities, which could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses and costs, assumption of liabilities and indemnities, increased compliance risks, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers or third parties. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses, which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, we will not receive the expected benefits, and alternative favorable opportunities to divest may not be 13available to us. If we cannot successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, or are unable to complete a divestiture, our financial results could be adversely affected.We rely on Rolls-Royce in connection with our aircraft spare engine leasing businesses, and certain factors that adversely affect Rolls-Royce could have an adverse effect on those businesses.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc. (“Rolls-Royce”) each own 50% of domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates” or “RRPF”) that own and lease aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. In addition, GATX directly invests in Rolls-Royce aircraft spare engines through its wholly-owned subsidiary, GATX Engine Leasing Ltd., and places these engines on long-term leases with airline operators, with RRPF serving as the asset manager.  Rolls-Royce is a major customer of the RRPF affiliates, as well as a critical supplier of aircraft spare engines and commercial, technical, and maintenance services to GATX and the RRPF affiliates. Rolls-Royce and RRPF are facing and may continue to face significant adverse financial and operational issues due to travel restrictions and the material decline in air travel associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. A deterioration in (1) the performance of services provided by Rolls-Royce or RRPF, or (2) the durability and reliability of Rolls-Royce engines, or (3) the financial condition, creditworthiness or liquidity of Rolls-Royce or RRPF could negatively impact GATX’s financial performance.Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. If we fail to negotiate acceptable labor agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our transportation assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make transportation assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers’ industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our transportation assets.Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. 14Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Inability to access railcar or tank container supply•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business, or retaliatory sanctions by such countries on U.S. companies•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, regulations, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States•Unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics, and international tensions and conflicts.Information Technology RisksWe rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.Threats to IT systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks have continued to increase in recent years in their frequency and levels of sophistication and intensity by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise. We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is used in all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the implementation of remote work options for employees, remote access to our networks and systems has increased substantially. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. We are subject to attempted cyber intrusions, hacks and ransom attacks, and we have had and continue to experience events of this nature and expect them to continue. While we have invested in the protection of our data and IT infrastructure, the steps we have taken to mitigate these risks may not be effective to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties, and we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyber-attack or information security incident from our workforce working remotely. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities or reputational damage. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations. While we maintain insurance to mitigate our exposure to these risks, our insurance policies carry retention and coverage limits, which may not be adequate to reimburse us for losses caused by security breaches or other cybersecurity events, and we may not be able to collect fully, if at all, under these insurance policies.We also are subject to an evolving body of federal, state and foreign laws, regulations, guidelines and principles regarding data privacy, data protection and data security. Many states as well as foreign governments have passed or proposed laws and regulations dealing with the collection and use of personal information obtained from their data subjects, including the E.U.’s General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act, and we could incur substantial penalties or litigation or reputational damage related to violations of such laws and regulations.15Legal and Regulatory RisksWe have been, and may continue to be, involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars or other assets.The nature of our business and assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the U.S. For example, some of our customers use certain types of our transportation assets to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving such transportation assets could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability. Similarly, if we fail to meet our obligations to maintain our assets in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for such failure as well as any resulting personal injury or property damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. Our transportation assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws, rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our fleets of transportation assets and related operations are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. Such laws, rules, and regulations could be changed in ways that would require us to modify our business models and objectives, impose requirements for additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our assets, or otherwise affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Violations of these laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeiture of assets, and reputational damage.We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased asset may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from such asset without regard to the owner’s fault. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate, including environmental laws and regulations, without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects such changes may have on our business. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, and the potential liability for our operations as well as those of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Severe weather, climate change, and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, flooding, fires and earthquakes, could cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities or other third parties to address GHG and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on GHG emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy, which could reduce demand for the lease of our assets, while rail and other transportation assets in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, or that directly or indirectly require fossil fuel consumption for operation of the assets could see reduced demand or be rendered obsolete if government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption or customer preferences change. New government regulations could also increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could reduce the demand for and value of our assets, and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.16Industry RisksWe depend on continued demand from our customers to lease or use our transportation assets and services at satisfactory rates. A significant decline in customer demand could negatively impact our business and financial performance. Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Customer demand for our transportation assets and services can be adversely affected by various economic and other factors, including: •Weak macroeconomic conditions •Weak market conditions in our customers’ businesses•Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities •Changes in railroad operations, efficiency, pricing and service offerings, including those related to “precision scheduled railroading”•Changes in, or disruptions to, supply chains•Availability of pipelines, trucks, and other alternative modes of transportation•Changes in conditions affecting the aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations •Other operational or commercial needs or decisions of our customers•World trade policiesDemand for our railcars and other transportation assets is dependent on the strength and growth of our customers’ businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical or fluctuating markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, transportation, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease our transportation assets or to lease them on profitable terms. Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of assets in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive transport alternatives. In either case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. In addition, demand for transportation assets used to transport ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time, while demand for transportation assets used to transport fossil fuels or that directly or indirectly require consumption of fossil fuels for operation may be affected by government policies and mandates with respect to climate change.The availability and relative cost of alternative modes of transportation and changes in customer transportation preferences also could reduce demand for our assets. For example, technological innovations in the trucking industry and patterns in U.S. economic growth that favor truck over rail could result in a modal shift away from rail and reduce customer demand for our rail assets. Demand for our other transportation assets and related services is also influenced by many of the factors discussed above. For example, aircraft spare engine leasing is influenced by airline and lessee profitability, patterns in global air travel, reliability and durability of engine types, world trade policies, technological advances, and price and other competitive factors. A significant decline in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.In many cases, demand for our transportation assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors could negatively impact demand for our transportation assets held for lease.A significant change in pricing and/or service offerings by North American railroads or poor operating conditions could reduce demand for our rail assets and negatively impact our financial performance.Our North American rail asset leasing business is impacted by the operations of the railroads, particularly the eight largest rail systems known as the “Class I railroads”, most of which are pursuing some form of major operational transformation under the umbrella term of “precision scheduled railroading” or “PSR”. If PSR results in substantial increases in train velocity or decreases in dwell time for rail assets, the resulting excess supply of railcars and/or locomotives may adversely impact the demand for our rail 17assets. Alternatively, if PSR results in increased pricing and/or reduced service frequency and quality, the value proposition of rail freight for shippers relative to alternative modes of transportation could be reduced. Apart from PSR, other factors such as adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, disruptions to railroad operations, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. Each of these cases could reduce demand for our rail assets and decreased fleet utilization due to modal shift away from rail, all of which could negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital, while some of our competitors manufacture railcars for their own leasing businesses. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases or services to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization, and investment volume.Economic and Credit RisksFluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to obtain financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and the capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments. Typical funding sources include commercial paper, bank term loans, public debt issuances, and a variety of other secured and unsecured financing structures. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. Financial and market dynamics and volatility, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, may heighten these risks. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.Changes in banks' inter-lending rate reporting practices or the phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.We have certain borrowing arrangements and financing structures that are based on the London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (“LIBOR”), primarily at our RRPF affiliates. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”), the administrator of U.S. Dollar LIBOR (“USD LIBOR”) and other IBORs, announced that, following required consultations, (i) it intends to cease publication of 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR at the end of 2021 and (ii) subject to compliance with applicable regulations, including as to representativeness, it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023. Globally, financial market participants have begun to transition away from LIBOR and other IBORs to alternative reference rates, and following the IBA’s announcement, U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, issued statements encouraging banks to stop entering into new USD LIBOR contracts “as soon as practicable,” and by no later than December 31, 2021, as entering into new contracts after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks for banks. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee composed of a diverse set of private and public sector entities, has recommended replacing USD LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities. At this time, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other interest rate benchmarks, or the 18establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks and ultimately on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, or other reforms may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.Inflation or deflation could have an unanticipated adverse impact on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and other transportation assets has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks or war, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of transportation assets against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of transportation assets and increase costs•A decrease in demand for transportation assets and services•Lower utilization of transportation equipment•Lower transportation asset lease and charter rates•Impairments and loss of transportation assets•Capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A significant deterioration of global growth, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets, arising from political or economic tensions, changes, and trends and/or an increase in trade conflict and protectionism.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material. Risks Related to our Common StockThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.The timing, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders and repurchases of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the “Board”). The Board’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future, and our payment of dividends and repurchase of shares could vary from historical practices and our stated expectations.A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.Six shareholders collectively control more than 60% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.19General Risk Factors
Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries and in tax rates and laws could adversely affect our financial results.As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax position and related liabilities. Our effective tax rate, cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, or material audit assessments, as well as by changes in the local tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretations thereof.  Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment annually, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets or the commodities that they carry, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived transportation assets such as rail assets, aircraft spare engines, tank containers, and marine vessels. The carrying value of these assets on our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive or unavailable, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.20Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. No system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of material error"
8,GATX,GATX CORP,2021-02-18,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
    Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Business and Operational RisksThe global COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on our businesses and financial performance, and the duration and extent of the pandemic could prolong or increase the adverse impact. We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and measures taken in response to the pandemic will adversely affect our personnel, operations, commercial activity, asset values, financial position or liquidity in the future.We depend on continued demand from our customers to lease or use our transportation assets and services and on our customers’ ability to pay for leased assets and services. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused a slowdown of economic activity around the world (including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains, a dramatic reduction in air travel, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and we expect these impacts may continue for the foreseeable future. There has been reduced demand for leasing of certain railcar types and for aircraft spare engines, as well as downward pressure on lease rates and renewals, and asset disposition activity across our segments, which adversely affects our financial performance. Prolonged weakness in certain sectors of the global economy may make it difficult to lease certain types of our transportation assets that are returned either at lease end or due to customer bankruptcies or defaults. Additionally, there have been a number of requests from certain railcar- and aircraft spare engine-leasing customers for payment deferrals and rate restructurings, and we and our RRPF affiliates have made such accommodations for certain of those customers, and may continue to make such accommodations in the future. The pandemic continues to threaten the solvency of airline operators who lease aircraft spare engines and increase their risk of bankruptcy. We also face ongoing operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, and have encountered and will continue to encounter ongoing workplace disruptions, temporary closures of our facilities, and reduced productivity, resulting in increased costs and adverse challenges for our rail operations. The pandemic has caused restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, including the need to limit employee travel, close facilities and offices, and implement work-from-home policies for employees. In particular, our remote work arrangements for employees, coupled with stay-at-home orders and quarantines, pose challenges for those employees and our IT systems, and extended periods of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, introduce operational risk, including cybersecurity and IT systems management risks. The situation surrounding COVID-19 is fluid, and if financial markets experience further disruption or increased volatility, we could face heightened risks related to our financing activities, including limited availability of funding or increased funding costs, which could adversely affect our business, financial position, and results of operations.Because the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic consequences are uncertain, rapidly changing, and difficult to predict, the pandemic’s impact on our operations, financial performance, and liquidity, as well as its impact on our ability to successfully execute our business strategy, remains uncertain and difficult to predict. Further, the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: governmental, business, suppliers', and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; general economic uncertainty in the global markets we serve and volatility in financial markets; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. While vaccines have been approved in certain 11countries, the availability of these vaccines currently is limited, and it is unclear how quickly vaccines will be made available in all the markets in which we operate. As a result, we expect COVID-19 to continue to negatively impact our operating results in future periods, including by increasing many of the risks described below. However, we are currently unable to provide any assurance as to the magnitude and duration of any such impact.A significant decrease in lease renewals of our transportation assets by our customers or a significant increase in the number of compliance-based maintenance events could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.Decreases in customer demand for our transportation assets could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the return of such assets by our customers. Returned transportation assets often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of leased assets requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs.We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our fleet of transportation assets. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the number of maintenance events in any given year. A significant increase in maintenance events or severe constraints in the repair networks may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we rely on third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures for our transportation assets, high demand faced by these providers from other asset owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars at reasonable rates, or at all. Furthermore, we may be required to take delivery of railcars at points when our financing costs may be high. These factors could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, if tariffs, trade disputes, commodity prices, or other factors lead to higher prices for steel or other raw materials used to manufacture railcars, we may be required to pay higher prices to purchase new railcars, which could adversely affect our ability to profitably lease those railcars to customers.Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket transportation assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleets, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to segment profit. Reduced demand for our assets due to adverse market conditions could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income. A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance. We may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities, which could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses and costs, assumption of liabilities and indemnities, increased compliance risks, and potential disputes with the 12buyers or sellers or third parties. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, we will not receive the expected benefits, and alternative favorable opportunities to divest may not be available to us. If we cannot successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, or are unable to complete a divestiture, our financial results could be adversely affected.We rely on Rolls-Royce in connection with our aircraft spare engine leasing businesses, and certain factors that adversely affect Rolls-Royce could have an adverse effect on those businesses.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc. (“Rolls-Royce”) each own 50% of domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates” or “RRPF”) that own and lease aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. In addition, GATX directly invests in Rolls-Royce aircraft spare engines through its wholly owned subsidiary, GATX Engine Leasing Ltd., and places these engines on long-term leases with airline operators, with RRPF serving as the asset manager.  Rolls-Royce is a major customer of the RRPF affiliates, as well as a critical supplier of aircraft spare engines and commercial, technical, and maintenance services to GATX and the RRPF affiliates. Rolls-Royce and RRPF are facing and may continue to face significant adverse financial and operational issues due to travel restrictions and the material decline in air travel associated with the pandemic. A deterioration in (1) the performance of services provided by Rolls-Royce or RRPF, or (2) the durability and reliability of Rolls-Royce engines, or (3) the financial condition, creditworthiness or liquidity of Rolls-Royce or RRPF could negatively impact GATX’s financial performance.Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. If we fail to negotiate acceptable labor agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Our transportation assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make transportation assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our transportation assets.Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies13•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Inability to access railcar supply•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States•Unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics, and international tensions and conflicts.Information Technology RisksWe rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.Threats to IT systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks have continued to increase in recent years. We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is used in all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, remote access to our networks and systems has increased substantially. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. The steps we have taken to mitigate these risks may not be effective to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties, and we may be more vulnerable to a successful cyber-attack or information security incident while our workforce works remotely. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.Legal and Regulatory RisksWe have been, and may continue to be, involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars or other assets.The nature of our business and assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the U.S. For example, some of our customers use certain types of our transportation assets to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving such transportation assets could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability. Similarly, if we fail to meet our obligations to maintain our assets in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for such failure as well as any resulting personal injury or property damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. Our transportation assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws, rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our fleets of transportation assets and related operations are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. Such laws, rules, and regulations could be changed in ways that would require us to modify our business models and objectives, impose requirements for additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our assets, or otherwise affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Violations of these laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeiture of assets.14We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased asset may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from such asset without regard to the owner's fault. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate, including environmental laws and regulations, without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects such changes may have on our business. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, and the potential liability for our operations as well as those of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Severe weather, climate change, and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, flooding and earthquakes, could cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities or other third parties under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address GHG and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on GHG emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy, which could reduce demand for the lease of our assets, while rail assets in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption or customer preferences change. New government regulations could also increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could reduce the demand for our assets and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Industry RisksWe depend on continued demand from our customers to lease or use our transportation assets and services at satisfactory rates. A significant decline in customer demand could negatively impact our business and financial performance. Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Customer demand for our transportation assets and services can be adversely affected by various economic and other factors, including: •Weak macroeconomic conditions •Weak market conditions in our customers’ businesses•Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities •Changes in railroad operations, efficiency, pricing and service offerings, including those related to ""precision scheduled railroading""•Changes in supply chains•Availability of pipelines, trucks, and other alternative modes of transportation•Changes in conditions affecting the aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations •Other operational or commercial needs or decisions of our customers•World trade policiesDemand for our railcars and other assets is dependent on the strength and growth of our customers' businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical or fluctuating markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, transportation, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease our transportation assets or to lease them on profitable terms. 15Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of assets in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive transport alternatives. In either case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. In addition, demand for rail assets used to transport ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time.The availability and relative cost of alternative modes of transportation and changes in customer transportation preferences also could reduce demand for our rail assets. For example, technological innovations in the trucking industry and patterns in U.S. economic growth that favor truck over rail could result in a modal shift away from rail and reduce customer demand for our rail assets. Demand for our marine and aircraft spare engine assets and related services is also influenced by many of the factors discussed above. For example, aircraft spare engine leasing is influenced by airline and lessee profitability, patterns in global air travel, reliability and durability of engine types, world trade policies, technological advances, and price and other competitive factors. A significant decline in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.In many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease.A significant change in pricing and/or service offerings by North American railroads or poor operating conditions could reduce demand for our rail assets and negatively impact our financial performance.Our North American rail asset leasing business is impacted by the operations of the railroads, particularly the eight largest rail systems known as the ""Class I railroads"", most of which are pursuing some form of major operational transformation under the umbrella term of ""precision scheduled railroading"" or ""PSR"". If PSR results in substantial increases in train velocity or decreases in dwell time for rail assets, the resulting excess supply of railcars and/or locomotives may adversely impact the demand for our rail assets. Alternatively, if PSR results in increased pricing and/or reduced service frequency and quality, the value proposition of rail freight for shippers relative to alternative modes of transportation could be reduced. Apart from PSR, other factors such as adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. Each of these cases could reduce demand for our rail assets and decreased fleet utilization due to modal shift away from rail, all of which could negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases or services to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization, and investment volume.Economic and Credit RisksFluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.16Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to obtain financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and the capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments. Typical funding sources include commercial paper, bank term loans, public debt issuances, and a variety of other secured and unsecured financing structures. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. Financial and market dynamics and volatility, including as a result of the impact of COVID-19, may heighten these risks. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.Changes in banks' inter-lending rate reporting practices or the phasing out of LIBOR may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.We have a significant amount of borrowing arrangements and financing structures that are based on the London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (""LIBOR""), including at our RRPF affiliates. On November 30, 2020, ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”), the administrator of U.S. Dollar LIBOR (“USD LIBOR”) and other IBORs, announced that, following required consultations, (i) it intends to cease publication of 1-week and 2-month USD LIBOR at the end of 2021 and (ii) subject to compliance with applicable regulations, including as to representativeness, it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining USD LIBOR tenors until June 30, 2023. Globally, financial market participants have begun to transition away from LIBOR and other IBORs to alternative reference rates, and following the IBA’s announcement, U.S. regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, issued statements encouraging banks to stop entering into new USD LIBOR contracts “as soon as practicable,” and by no later than December 31, 2021, as entering into new contracts after December 31, 2021, would create safety and soundness risks for banks. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of a diverse set of private and public sector entities, has recommended replacing USD LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities. At this time, there continues to be uncertainty regarding the effect that these developments, any discontinuance, modification or other reforms to LIBOR or any other interest rate benchmarks, or the establishment of alternative reference rates may have on LIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks and ultimately on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, or other reforms may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.Inflation or deflation could have an unanticipated adverse impact on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and marine assets has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks or war, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of transportation assets against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of transportation assets and increase costs•A decrease in demand for transportation assets and services•Lower utilization of transportation equipment•Lower transportation asset lease and charter rates•Impairments and loss of transportation assets17•Capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A significant deterioration of global growth, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets, arising from political or economic tensions, changes, and trends and/or an increase in trade conflict and protectionism.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material. Risks Related to our Common StockThere can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.The timing, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders and repurchases of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the ""Board""). The Board’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future, and our payment of dividends and repurchase of shares could vary from historical practices and our stated expectations.A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.Six shareholders collectively control more than 60% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.General Risk Factors
Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries and in tax rates and laws could adversely affect our financial results.As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous other non-U.S. jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required to determine our consolidated income tax position and related liabilities. Our effective tax rate, cash flows and operating results could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with different statutory tax rates, or material audit assessments, as well as by changes in the local tax laws, regulations and treaties, or the interpretations thereof.  Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.18We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment annually, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived transportation assets such as rail assets, aircraft spare engines, and marine vessels. The carrying value of these assets on our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive or unavailable, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. No system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of material error"
3,GATX,GATX CORP,2020-02-19,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We have been, and may continue to be, involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars or other assets.The nature of our business and assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the U.S. For example, some of our customers use certain types of our rail assets to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving such rail assets could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability. Similarly, if we fail to meet our obligations to maintain our assets in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for such failure as well as any resulting personal injury or property damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. We depend on continued demand from our customers to lease or use our transportation assets and services at satisfactory rates. A significant decline in customer demand could negatively impact our business and financial performance.  Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Customer demand for our transportation assets and services can be adversely affected by various economic and other factors, including:  •Weak macroeconomic conditions •Weak market conditions in our customers’ businesses•Declines in harvest or production volumes•Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities •Changes in railroad operations and efficiency•Changes in railroad pricing and service offerings, including those related to ""precision scheduled railroading""•Changes in supply chains•Availability of pipelines, trucks, and other alternative modes of transportation•Conditions on the Great Lakes•Changes in conditions affecting the aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations •Other operational or commercial needs or decisions of our customers•World trade policiesDemand for our railcars and other assets is dependent on the strength and growth of our customers' businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, transportation, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease certain types of transportation assets that are either returned at the end of a lease term or returned as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of assets in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive transport alternatives. In either case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. In addition, demand for rail assets used to transport ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time.The availability and relative cost of alternative modes of transportation and changes in customer transportation preferences also could reduce demand for our rail assets.  For example, technological innovations in the trucking industry and patterns in U.S. economic growth that favor truck over rail could result in a modal shift away from rail and reduce customer demand for our rail assets.  Demand for our marine and aircraft spare engine assets and related services is also influenced by many of the factors discussed above. For example, aircraft spare engine leasing is influenced by airline and lessee profitability, reliability and durability of engine types, world trade policies, technological advances, and price and other competitive factors. A significant decline in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.11In many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including recent changes to lease accounting rules and the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease.A significant change in pricing and/or service offerings by North American railroads or poor operating conditions could reduce demand for our rail assets and negatively impact financial performance.Our North American rail asset leasing business is impacted by the operations of the railroads, particularly the eight largest rail systems known as the ""Class I railroads"", most of which are pursuing some form of major operational transformation under the umbrella term of ""precision scheduled railroading"" or ""PSR"". If PSR results in substantial increases in train velocity or decreases in dwell time for rail assets, the resulting excess supply of railcars and/or locomotives may adversely impact the demand for our rail assets. Alternatively, if PSR results in increased pricing and/or reduced service frequency and quality, the value proposition of rail freight for shippers relative to alternative modes of transportation could be reduced. Apart from PSR, other factors such as adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. Each of these cases could reduce demand for our rail assets and decreased fleet utilization due to modal shift away from rail, all of which could negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.A significant decrease in lease renewals of our transportation assets by our customers or a significant increase in the number of compliance-based maintenance events could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.Decreases in customer demand for our transportation assets could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the return of such assets by our customers. Returned transportation assets often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of leased assets requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs.We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our fleet. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the number of maintenance events in any given year. A significant increase in maintenance or severe constraints in the repair networks may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we rely on third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures for our transportation assets, high demand faced by these providers from other asset owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars and our financing costs may be high, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, if tariffs, trade disputes, commodity prices, or other factors lead to higher prices for steel or other raw materials used to manufacture railcars, we may be required to pay higher prices to purchase new railcars, which could adversely affect our ability to profitably lease those railcars to customers.Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket transportation assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleets, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to segment profit.  Reduced demand for our assets due to adverse market conditions could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income. A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance.12We may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition and divestiture activities, which could have an adverse impact on our financial statements.From time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These acquisitions and divestitures may present financial, managerial, and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses and costs, assumption of liabilities and indemnities, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers or third parties. In addition, we may be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, we will not receive the expected benefits, and alternative favorable opportunities to divest may not be available to us. If we cannot successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, or are unable to complete a divestiture, our financial results could be adversely affected.We have significant financial exposure related to the performance of our aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc. each own 50% of domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates”) that own and lease aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce plc. and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. Rolls-Royce plc. is a major customer of the RRPF affiliates, as well as a critical supplier of aircraft spare engines and commercial, technical, and maintenance services to the RRPF affiliates. A deterioration in (1) the performance of such services by Rolls-Royce plc., (2) the durability and reliability of Rolls-Royce, plc. engines, or (3) the creditworthiness of Rolls-Royce plc., could negatively impact the financial performance of the RRPF affiliates.In addition, as a 50% partner in the RRPF affiliates, we may not have control over operational matters, which could result in actions that have an adverse financial impact on the RRPF affiliates, and could expose us to potential liability. The RRPF affiliates contribute significantly to our financial results. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF affiliates deteriorates, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. If we fail to negotiate acceptable labor agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment annually, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.13Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to obtain financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and the capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments. Typical funding sources include commercial paper, bank term loans, public debt issuances, and a variety of other secured and unsecured financing structures. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. If we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.Changes in banks' inter-lending rate reporting practices or the phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.We have a significant amount of borrowing arrangements and financing structures that are based on the London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (""LIBOR""), including at our RRPF affiliates. In July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority announced they would not require panel banks to continue submitting quotes for LIBOR after 2021. In addition, the U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of a diverse set of private and public sector entities, has recommended replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR""), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities. At this time, it is not possible to predict whether any such changes will occur, which alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR could be enacted in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere, or the effect that any such changes, alternative reference rates or other reforms, if they occur, would have on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, or other reforms may adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases or services to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization, and investment volume.Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. 14Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Inability to access railcar supply•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States•Unforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics, and international tensions and conflicts.Our transportation assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws, rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our fleets of transportation assets and related operations are subject to various U.S. and non-U.S. laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. Such laws, rules, and regulations could be changed in ways that would require us to modify our business models and objectives, impose requirements for additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our assets, or otherwise affect our returns on investments by restricting existing activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs or prohibiting them outright. Violations of these laws, rules, and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeiture of assets.We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive or unavailable, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased asset may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from such asset without regard to the owner's fault. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate, including environmental laws and regulations, without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects such changes may have on our business. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, and the potential liability for our operations as well as those of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.15There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.The timing, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders and repurchases of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the ""Board""). The Board’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future, and our payment of dividends and repurchase of shares could vary from historical practices and our stated expectations.The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived transportation assets such as rail assets, aircraft spare engines, and marine vessels. The carrying value of these assets on our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.Our assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make transportation assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our rail, aircraft spare engine, and marine assets.Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact business operations of our American Steamship Company (""ASC"") subsidiary, which could result in increases in costs and decreases in revenues.The success of our ASC subsidiary depends on the efficiency of its marine operations on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, such as high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions may restrict the volume that ASC's vessels can transport per trip. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Severe weather, climate change, and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, flooding and earthquakes, could cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities or other third parties under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address GHG and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on GHG emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy, which could reduce demand for the lease of our assets, while rail assets in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption or customer preferences change. New government regulations could also increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change, could reduce the demand for our assets and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.Six shareholders collectively control more than 60% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.16Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate.We are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, material audit assessments, or legislative changes that impact statutory tax rates, which could include an impact on previously-recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.Inflation or deflation could have an unanticipated adverse impact on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and marine assets has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks or war, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of transportation assets against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of transportation assets and increase costs•A decrease in demand for transportation assets and services•Lower utilization of transportation equipment•Lower transportation asset lease and charter rates•Impairments and loss of transportation assets•Capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A significant deterioration of global growth, and related decreases in confidence or investment activity in the global markets, arising from political or economic tensions, changes, and trends and/or an increase in trade conflict and protectionism.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.17We rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.Threats to IT systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks have continued to increase in recent years. We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is used in all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. The steps we have taken to mitigate these risks may not be effective to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. No system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of material error"
10,GATX,GATX CORP,2019-02-25,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We have been, and may continue to be, involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars or other assets.The nature of our business and assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the U.S. Customers use certain types of railcars to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving our railcars could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability, particularly where the accident involves serious personal injuries or the loss of life. If we do not maintain railcars in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. We may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates.Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Circumstances such as excess capacity in particular railcar types or generally in the marketplace, decreases in customer demand for our railcars, economic downturns, changes in customer behavior, or other changes in supply or demand can adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates. Economic uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for our assets could cause customers to request shorter lease terms and lower lease rates, which may result in a decrease in our asset utilization rate and reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low lease rates for longer terms, which may result in an adverse impact on current or future revenues.We depend on continued demand from our customers to lease our railcars and utilize our other assets and services.  A significant decline in customer demand could negatively impact our business and financial performance.  Customer demand for our railcars and other assets and services can be adversely affected by various economic and other factors, including:  •Weak macroeconomic conditions •Weak market conditions in our customers’ businesses•Declines in harvest or production volumes•Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities •Changes in railroad operations and efficiency•Changes in supply chains•Availability of pipelines, trucks, and other alternative modes of transportation 12•Other operational or commercial needs or decisions of our customers.Demand for our railcars and other assets is dependent on the strength and growth of our customers' businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease certain types of railcars that are either returned at the end of a lease term or returned as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of railcars in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive alternatives that are not delivered by rail. In either case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. In addition, demand for railcars used to transport ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time.Railroad infrastructure investments that improve efficiency or declines in rail traffic due to decreased demand could increase the average speed at which railroads can operate their trains, which may reduce the number of railcars needed for railroads to haul the same amount of cargo. Adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. Reductions in service by railroads to conform to new financial goals or operating practices could reduce the attractiveness of rail to shippers relative to other modes of transportation.  In each case, these changes could reduce demand for our railcars and negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.The availability and relative cost of alternative modes of transportation and changes in customer transportation preferences also could reduce demand for our railcars.  For example, technological innovations in the trucking industry and patterns in U.S. economic growth that favor truck over rail could result in a modal shift away from rail and reduce customer demand for our rail assets.  Demand for our marine assets and shipping services is also influenced by many of the factors discussed above. A significant decline in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.In many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including recent changes to lease accounting rules and the Tax Act, could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease.A significant decrease in lease renewals by our customers or a significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring compliance-based maintenance could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.Decreases in customer demand for our railcars could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the return of railcars. Railcars that are returned by our customers often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of railcars requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, low demand for certain types of railcars in our fleet may make those railcars more difficult to lease to new customers if they are returned at the end of their existing leases or following a customer default, which could negatively affect our results of operations.We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our full-service tank cars based on their service time. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the volume of tank cars requiring extensive maintenance in any given year. A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring maintenance may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we have contracted with third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures to the extent our demand exceeds our owned maintenance capacity, high demand faced by these providers from other tank car owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.13Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars and our financing costs may be high, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, if tariffs, trade disputes, commodity prices, or other factors lead to higher prices for steel or other raw materials used to manufacture railcars, we may be required to pay higher prices to purchase new railcars, which could adversely affect our ability to profitably lease those railcars to customers.Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket rail assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleet, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to Rail North America’s segment profit.  Reduced demand for our assets due to adverse market conditions could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.  A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance.We have significant financial exposure related to the performance of our aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc (“Rolls Royce”) each own 50% of 17 domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates”) that own and lease aircraft engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. These investments expose us to various risks associated with the commercial aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations unique to that industry. The financial results of the RRPF affiliates depend heavily on the performance of Rolls-Royce, as Rolls-Royce is both a major customer of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the RRPF affiliates. In addition, Rolls-Royce manages the RRPF affiliates and, as a result, we may not have control over operational matters, which could result in actions that have an adverse economic impact on the RRPF affiliates, or us, or could expose us to potential liability. The RRPF affiliates contribute significantly to our financial results. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF affiliates deteriorates, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.14Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. We have generally been successful in negotiating acceptable agreements with the unions without experiencing material work stoppages. However, if we fail to negotiate acceptable new agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment annually, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to secure financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and the capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments. Typical funding sources include commercial paper, bank term loans, public debt issuances, and a variety of other secured and unsecured financing structures. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. If we are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.Uncertainty relating to the LIBOR calculation process and potential phasing out of LIBOR after 2021 may adversely affect the market value of our current or future debt obligations, including our long-term debt instruments and our bank credit facilities.We have a material amount of borrowing arrangements and financing structures that base interest rates on the London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (""LIBOR""). Regulators and law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom and elsewhere are conducting civil and criminal investigations into whether the banks that contributed to the British Bankers’ Association (the “BBA”) in connection with the calculation of daily LIBOR may have been under-reporting or otherwise manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR.  A number of BBA member banks have entered into settlements with their regulators and law enforcement agencies with respect to this alleged manipulation of LIBOR.  Actions by the BBA or any other administrator of LIBOR, regulators or law enforcement agencies may result in changes to the manner in which LIBOR is determined, the phasing out of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative reference rates.  For example, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021.  As a result, LIBOR may be discontinued by 2021.  Furthermore, in the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates that could replace LIBOR include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  At this time, it is not possible to predict whether any such changes will occur, whether LIBOR will be phased out or any such alternative reference rates or other reforms to LIBOR will be enacted in the United Kingdom, the United States or elsewhere or the effect that any such changes, phase out, alternative reference rates or other reforms, if they occur, would have on the amount of interest paid on, or the market value of, our current or future debt obligations, including our long-term debt instruments and our bank credit facilities.  Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, phase out, alternative reference rates or other reforms may materially adversely affect the trading market for LIBOR-based securities, including our long-term debt instruments and our bank credit facilities.  Reform of, or the replacement or phasing out of, LIBOR and proposed regulation of LIBOR and other “benchmarks” may materially adversely affect the market value of, the applicable interest rate on and the amount of interest paid on our current or future debt obligations, including our long-term debt instruments and our bank credit 15facilities.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization, and investment volume.Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international rail growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States.Our rail and marine assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our rail and marine operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In North America, our railcar fleet and operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards, rules, and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and the Association of American Railroads. State and provincial agencies regulate some health and safety matters related to rail operations not otherwise preempted by federal law. Our business and our railcar fleet may be adversely impacted by new rules or regulations, or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our railcars, or could make certain types of railcars inoperable or obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to the end of their useful lives. In addition, violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.Similarly, our marine assets and operations are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, U.S. citizen ownership requirements, emissions, ballast discharges, and other environmental and operational matters enforced by various federal and state agencies, including the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, we could be prohibited from operating or leasing marine assets in the U.S. market, and under certain circumstances, could incur severe fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.In addition, our foreign operations are subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where we do business. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations, or if they change in the future, the use of our assets could be restricted, or the economic value of 16our assets may be reduced. These restrictions or reductions could lead to loss of revenue or cause us to incur significant expenses to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, and regulations, or actions, could result in the obsolescence of various assets or impose compliance costs that are significant enough to render those assets economically obsolete.We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased railcar may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from a railcar without regard to the owner's fault. We routinely assess environmental liabilities, including our potential obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites and the possible amount of recoveries from other responsible parties. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks within which we operate, including environmental laws and regulations, without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects such changes may have on our business. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, and the potential liability for the operations of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.Although we have paid regular cash dividends for over 100 consecutive years and conduct periodic share repurchase programs, the timing, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders and repurchases of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the ""Board""). The Board’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future, and our payment of dividends and repurchase of shares could vary from historical practices and our stated expectations.The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived assets such as railcars and marine vessels. The carrying value of these assets in our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.Our assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our rail and marine assets. A pronounced reduction in customer demand or change in customers' preferred method of product transportation could result in the economic obsolescence of the assets leased by those customers.17Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact business operations of our American Steamship Company (“ASC”) subsidiary, which could result in increases in costs and decreases in revenues.The success of our ASC subsidiary depends on the efficiency of its operations on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, such as high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions may restrict the volume that ASC's vessels can transport per trip. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.There is increasing global regulatory focus on climate change and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. Climate change may also pose regulatory and environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Severe weather, climate change, and natural disasters, such as tornadoes, flooding and earthquakes, could cause significant business interruptions and result in increased costs and liabilities and decreased revenues. Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address GHG and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on GHG emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy. Customers' increased costs could reduce their demand to lease our assets. In addition, railcars in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if new government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. New government regulations could also increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the demand for our assets and could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.Six shareholders collectively control more than 65% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate.We are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, material audit assessments, or legislative changes that impact statutory tax rates, which could include an impact on previously-recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.18We cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or deflation will have on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and marine assets has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks or war, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of railcars and marine vessels•A decrease in demand for rail and marine services•Lower utilization of rail and marine equipment•Lower rail lease and marine charter rates•Impairments of rail and marine assets•Capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A downturn in the commercial aviation industry, which could lead to adverse financial results for our RRPF affiliates.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.We rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our information technology (“IT”) infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.Threats to IT systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks have continued to increase in recent years. We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is used in all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. Although we have taken steps to mitigate these risks, we may not be able to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. Although management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of material error"
2,GATX,GATX CORP,2018-02-21,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We have been, and may continue to be, involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars or other assets.The nature of our business and assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the U.S. Customers use certain types of railcars to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving our railcars could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability, particularly where the accident involves serious personal injuries or the loss of life. If we do not maintain railcars in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. We may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates.Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Circumstances such as excess capacity in particular railcar types or generally in the marketplace, decreases in customer demand for our railcars, economic downturns, changes in customer behavior, or other changes in supply or demand can adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates. Economic uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for our assets could cause customers to request shorter lease terms and lower lease rates, which may result in a decrease in our asset utilization rate and reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low lease rates for longer terms, which may result in an adverse impact on current or future revenues.We depend on continued demand from our customers to lease our railcars and utilize our other assets and services.  A significant decline in customer demand could negatively impact our business and financial performance.  Customer demand for our railcars and other assets and services can be adversely affected by various economic and other factors, including:  •Weak macroeconomic conditions •Weak market conditions in our customers’ businesses•Declines in harvest or production volumes•Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities •Changes in railroad operations and efficiency•Changes in supply chains13•Availability of pipelines, trucks, and other alternative modes of transportation •Other operational or commercial needs or decisions of our customers.Demand for our railcars and other assets is dependent on the strength and growth of our customers' businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease certain types of railcars that are either returned at the end of a lease term or returned as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of railcars in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive alternatives that are not delivered by rail. In either case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. In addition, demand for railcars used to transport ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time.Railroad infrastructure investments that improve efficiency or declines in rail traffic due to decreased demand could increase the average speed at which railroads can operate their trains, which may reduce the number of railcars needed for railroads to haul the same amount of cargo. Adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. Reductions in service by railroads to conform to new financial goals or operating practices could reduce the attractiveness of rail to shippers relative to other modes of transportation.  In each case, these changes could reduce demand for our railcars and negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.The availability and relative cost of alternative modes of transportation and changes in customer transportation preferences also could reduce demand for our railcars.  For example, technological innovations in the trucking industry and patterns in U.S. economic growth that favor truck over rail could result in a modal shift away from rail and reduce customer demand for our rail assets.  Demand for our marine assets and shipping services is also influenced by many of the factors discussed above. A significant decline in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.In many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including recent changes to lease accounting rules and the Tax Act, could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease.A significant decrease in lease renewals by our customers or a significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring compliance-based maintenance could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.Decreases in customer demand for our railcars could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the return of railcars. Railcars that are returned by our customers often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of railcars requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, low demand for certain types of railcars in our fleet may make those railcars more difficult to lease to new customers if they are returned at the end of their existing leases or following a customer default, which could negatively affect our results of operations.We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our full-service tank cars based on their service time. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the volume of tank cars requiring extensive maintenance in any given year. A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring maintenance may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we have contracted with third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures to the extent our demand exceeds our owned maintenance capacity, high demand faced by these providers from other tank car owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.14Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars and our financing costs may be high, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket rail assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleet, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to Rail North America’s segment profit.  Reduced demand for our assets due to adverse market conditions could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.  A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance.We have significant financial exposure related to the performance of our aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc (“Rolls Royce”) each own 50% of sixteen domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates”) that own and lease aircraft engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. These investments expose us to various risks associated with the commercial aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations unique to that industry. The financial results of the RRPF affiliates depend heavily on the performance of Rolls-Royce, as Rolls-Royce is both a major customer of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the RRPF affiliates. The RRPF affiliates contribute significantly to our financial results. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF affiliates deteriorates, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.Recent changes to U.S. federal tax law as a result of the Tax Act may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Tax Act has significantly changed the way that U.S. corporations are taxed at the federal level, including by:•Reducing the U.S. corporate income tax rate •Limiting interest deductions •Permitting immediate expensing of certain capital expenditures •Adopting elements of a territorial tax system, imposing a one-time transition tax on all undistributed earnings and profits of certain U.S.-owned foreign corporations •Revising the rules governing net operating losses and the rules governing foreign tax credits •Repealing the deduction of certain performance-based compensation paid to an expanded group of executive officers •Introducing new anti-base erosion provisions. Many of these changes were effective immediately, without any transition periods or grandfathering for existing transactions. The legislation was unclear in certain respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service, any of which could reduce or increase certain impacts of the legislation. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxes, which often use federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities. While some of the changes made by the tax legislation may adversely affect us in one or more reporting periods and prospectively, other changes may be beneficial on a going-forward basis. 15Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the U.S. dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. We have generally been successful in negotiating acceptable agreements with the unions without experiencing material work stoppages. However, if we fail to negotiate acceptable new agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment annually, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to secure financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and the capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. If we are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization, and investment volume.Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international rail growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. 16Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States.Our rail and marine assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our rail and marine operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In North America, our railcar fleet and operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards, rules, and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and the Association of American Railroads. State and provincial agencies regulate some health and safety matters related to rail operations not otherwise preempted by federal law. Our business and our railcar fleet may be adversely impacted by new rules or regulations, or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our railcars, or could make certain types of railcars inoperable or obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to the end of their useful lives. In addition, violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.Similarly, our marine assets and operations are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, U.S. citizen ownership requirements, emissions, ballast discharges, and other environmental and operational matters enforced by various federal and state agencies, including the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, we could be prohibited from operating or leasing marine assets in the U.S. market, and under certain circumstances, could incur severe fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.In addition, our foreign operations are subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where we do business. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations, or if they change in the future, the use of our assets could be restricted, or the economic value of our assets may be reduced. These restrictions or reductions could lead to loss of revenue or cause us to incur significant expenses to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, and regulations, or actions, could result in the obsolescence of various assets or impose compliance costs that are significant enough to render those assets economically obsolete.We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.17We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines, and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased railcar may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from a railcar without regard to the owner's fault. We routinely assess environmental liabilities, including our potential obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites and the possible amount of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, and the potential liability for the operations of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares of our common stock at current levels.Although we have paid regular cash dividends for 100 consecutive years and conduct periodic share repurchase programs, the timing, amount and payment of future dividends to shareholders and repurchases of our common stock fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors (the ""Board""). The Board’s decisions regarding the payment of dividends and repurchase of shares depend on many factors such as our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, debt service obligations, legal requirements, regulatory constraints, and other factors that our Board may deem relevant. We cannot guarantee that we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares in the future, and our payment of dividends and repurchase of shares could vary from historical practices and our stated expectations.The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived assets such as railcars and marine vessels. The carrying value of these assets in our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.Our assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our rail and marine assets. A pronounced reduction in customer demand or change in customers' preferred method of product transportation could result in the economic obsolescence of the assets leased by those customers.Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact business operations of our American Steamship Company (“ASC”)  subsidiary, which could result in increases in costs and decreases in revenues.The success of our ASC subsidiary depends on the efficiency of its operations on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, such as high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions may restrict the volume that ASC's vessels can transport per trip. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.We are subject to the inherent risks of our affiliate investments.18We are indirectly exposed to risks through our ownership interests in affiliates, as our affiliates may experience many of the same risks discussed in this ""Risk Factors
"" section. Rolls-Royce manages our RRPF affiliates, and we sometimes retain third parties to manage assets we own directly, such as our ocean-going vessels. Poor business or financial results of these affiliates, or the third parties who manage, operate, or invest along with us in these affiliates, could negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, when a third party manages or operates an affiliate or asset, we may not have control over operational matters related to the affiliate or asset, which could result in actions that have an adverse economic impact on the affiliate, the asset, or us or could expose us to potential liability.We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy. Customers' increased costs could reduce their demand to lease our assets. In addition, railcars in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if new government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. New government regulations could also increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. Potential consequences of laws, rules, or regulations addressing climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.Four shareholders collectively control more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate.We are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws (including changes to federal tax law as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017), material audit assessments, or legislative changes that impact statutory tax rates, which could include an impact on previously-recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.19We cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or deflation will have on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and marine assets has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks or war, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of railcars and marine vessels•A decrease in demand for rail and marine services•Lower utilization of rail and marine equipment•Lower rail lease and marine charter rates•Impairments of rail and marine assets•Capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A downturn in the commercial aviation industry, which could lead to adverse financial results for our RRPF affiliates.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.We rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our information technology (""IT"") infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is critical to all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. Although we have taken steps to mitigate these risks, we may not be able to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. Although management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of error"
13,GATX,GATX CORP,2017-02-22,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.We have been and may continue to be involved in various types of litigation, including claims for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage, and other claims arising from an accident involving our railcars.The nature of our business and our assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the US. Customers use certain types of our railcars to transport flammable liquids and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving our railcars could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability, particularly where the accident involves serious personal injuries or the loss of life. If we do not maintain railcars in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules, we could be subject to fines, penalties, and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial penalties or monetary damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation. We may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates due to decreases in customer demand, oversupply of railcars in the market, or other changes in supply and demand.Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Circumstances such as excess capacity in particular railcar types or generally in the marketplace, decreases in customer demand for our railcars, economic downturns, changes in customer behavior, or other changes in supply or demand can adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates. Economic uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for our assets could cause customers to request shorter lease terms and lower lease rates, which may result in a decrease in our asset utilization rate and reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low lease rates for longer terms, which may result in an adverse impact on current or future revenues.Weak economic conditions and other factors may decrease customer demand for our assets and services and negatively impact our business and results of operations.We rely on continued demand from our customers to lease our railcars. Demand for these assets and services depends on the markets for our customers’ products and services and the strength and growth of their businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease certain types of railcars that are either returned at the end of a lease term or returned as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.Additional factors, such as changes in harvest or production volumes, changes in supply chains, choices in types of transportation assets, availability of pipelines or other modes of transportation, and other operational needs may also influence customer demand for our assets. Demand for our marine assets and shipping services also depends on many of the factors discussed above. Significant declines in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.In many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including anticipated changes to lease accounting rules, could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease.Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, commodities could reduce demand for our railcars and have a negative impact on our results of operations.Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of railcars in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to reduce their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive alternatives that are not delivered by rail. In each case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity.14Demand for railcars that are used to transport crude oil and related products, including commodities used in drilling operations and commodities produced by refineries, is dependent on the demand for these commodities. While only about 1.4% of our worldwide fleet is engaged in the shipment of crude oil, approximately 21% of our North American fleet is leased to refiners and other petroleum-related customers, making them an important source of our worldwide revenue. Sustained low oil prices have caused and may continue to cause oil producers to curtail the drilling of new wells or cease production at certain existing wells that are uneconomical to operate at current crude price levels. Reduced oil drilling activity has resulted in and may continue to result in decreased demand for our railcars used to transport the commodities used in drilling operations, such as frac sand and fracking chemicals, and the commodities produced by drilling operations, including crude oil and natural gas liquids. Market conditions unfavorable to refiners could result in decreased shipments of refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, petrochemicals and natural gas liquids. Sustained low prices for crude oil and/or the existence of unfavorable market conditions for North American refiners could reduce (and in some cases have already reduced) customer demand for our railcars and negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.Demand for railcars that are used to transport ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time. It is possible that the reduction or elimination of current US mandates for ethanol blending in motor fuels could reduce the production of ethanol, which would reduce demand for portions of our tank car fleet and negatively impact our revenue and profitability.A significant decrease in lease renewals by our customers or a significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring compliance-based maintenance could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs.Decreases in customer demand for our railcars could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration, resulting in the early return of railcars. Railcars that are returned by our customers often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of railcars requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, low demand for certain types of railcars in our fleet may make those railcars more difficult to lease to new customers if they are returned at the end of their existing leases or following a customer default, which could negatively affect our results of operations.We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our full-service tank cars based on their service time. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the volume of tank cars requiring extensive maintenance in any given year. A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring maintenance may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we have contracted with third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures to the extent our demand exceeds our owned maintenance capacity, high demand faced by these providers from other tank car owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.15Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars and our financing costs may be high, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket rail assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleet, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to Rail North America’s segment profit.  Reduced demand for our assets due to adverse market conditions could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.  A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance.We have significant financial exposure related to the performance of our aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc (“Rolls Royce”) each own 50% of fifteen domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates”) that own and lease aircraft engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. These investments expose us to various risks associated with the commercial aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations unique to that industry. The financial results of the RRPF affiliates depend heavily on the performance of Rolls-Royce, as Rolls-Royce is both a major customer of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the RRPF affiliates. The RRPF affiliates contribute significantly to our financial results. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF affiliates deteriorates, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the US dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. We have generally been successful in negotiating acceptable agreements with the unions without experiencing material work stoppages. However, if we fail to negotiate acceptable new agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Changes in railroad efficiency may adversely affect demand for our railcars.Railroad infrastructure investments that improve efficiency or declines in rail traffic due to decreased demand could increase the average speed at which railroads can operate their trains, which may reduce the number of railcars needed for railroads to haul the same amount of cargo. Adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. In each case, these changes could reduce demand for our railcars and negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.16Rules in the US and Canada applicable to tank cars carrying crude oil, ethanol, and other flammable liquids have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our tank car fleet in flammable liquids service.In 2015, legislators and regulatory authorities in the US and Canada adopted legislation and regulations that revised the design standards for tank cars used to transport various flammable liquids. Existing tank cars in flammables service that were built prior to the adoption of the revised design standards must be modified or removed from service between November, 2016, and May, 2029, depending on the type of car, the type of commodity carried, and whether the car is used in the US, Canada, or both countries. We have a fleet of approximately 122,000 railcars in North America, including approximately 12,200 tank cars currently used to transport flammable liquids that are affected by the new rules, of which approximately 3,800 are moving crude oil and ethanol. Over 90% of our affected tank cars have a compliance deadline of 2023 or later. We expect to modify some of the most modern of our affected cars tank cars to comply with the new standards.  However, for the majority of the affected cars, we currently anticipate retiring, redeploying, or selling them rather than performing retrofits. We have recognized an impairment charge on approximately 2,400 of the affected railcars to write them down to their estimated fair value, and we could incur additional impairment charges in the future. The additional costs to modify certain tank cars and the cost of retiring tank cars early could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment regularly, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by managementDeterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to secure financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. If we are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization and investment volume.Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international rail growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:17•Noncompliance with US laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States.Our rail and marine assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our rail and marine operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In North America, our railcar fleet and operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards, rules, and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the US Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the US Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and the Association of American Railroads. State and provincial agencies regulate some health and safety matters related to rail operations not otherwise preempted by federal law. Our business and our railcar fleet may be adversely impacted by new rules or regulations, or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our railcars, or could make certain types of railcars inoperable or obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to the end of their useful lives. In addition, violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.Similarly, our marine assets and operations are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, US citizen ownership requirements, emissions, ballast discharges, and other environmental and operational matters enforced by various federal and state agencies, including the Maritime Administration of the US Department of Transportation, the US Coast Guard, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, we could be prohibited from operating or leasing marine assets in the US market, and under certain circumstances, could incur severe fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.In addition, our foreign operations are subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where we do business. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations, or if they change in the future, the use of our assets could be restricted, or the economic value of our assets may be reduced. These restrictions or reductions could lead to loss of revenue or cause us to incur significant expenses to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, and regulations, or actions, could result in the obsolescence of various assets or impose compliance costs that are significant enough to render those assets economically obsolete.We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.18We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased railcar may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from a railcar without regard to the owner's fault. We routinely assess environmental liabilities, including our potential obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites and the possible amount of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties and the potential liability for the operations of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived assets such as railcars and marine vessels. The carrying value of these assets in our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.Our assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our rail and marine assets. A reduction in customer demand or change in customers' preferred method of product transportation could result in the economic obsolescence of the assets leased by those customers.Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact business operations, which could result in increases in costs and decreases in revenues.The success of our ASC subsidiary depends on the efficiency of its operations on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, such as high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions may restrict the volume that ASC's vessels can transport per trip. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.We are subject to the inherent risks of our affiliate investments.We are indirectly exposed to risks through our ownership interests in affiliates, as our affiliates may experience many of the same risks discussed in this ""Risk Factors
"" section. Rolls-Royce manages our RRPF affiliates, and we sometimes retain third parties to manage assets we own directly, such as our ocean-going vessels. Poor business or financial results of these affiliates, or the third parties who manage, operate, or invest along with us in these affiliates, could negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, when a third party manages or operates an affiliate or asset, we may not have control over operational matters related to the affiliate or asset, which could result in actions that have an adverse economic impact on the affiliate, the asset, or GATX or could expose GATX to potential liability.We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy. Customers' increased costs could reduce their demand to lease our assets. In addition, railcars in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if new government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. New government regulations could also increase our operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. Potential consequences of laws, rules, or regulations addressing climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.19A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.Four shareholders collectively control more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the US and foreign countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate.We are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, material audit assessments, or legislative changes that impact statutory tax rates, which could include an impact on previously-recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.We cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or deflation will have on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and marine assets has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of railcars and marine vessels•A decrease in demand for rail and marine services•Lower utilization of rail and marine equipment•Lower rail lease and marine charter rates•Impairments of rail and marine assets•Capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A downturn in the commercial aviation industry, which could lead to adverse financial results for our RRPF affiliates.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.20We rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our IT infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is critical to all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. Although we have taken steps to mitigate these risks, we may not be able to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. Although management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of error"
4,GATX,GATX CORP,2016-02-24,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates due to decreases in customer demand, oversupply of railcars in the market, or other changes in supply and demand.Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Circumstances such as excess capacity in particular railcar types or generally in the marketplace, decreases in customer demand for our railcars, economic downturns, changes in customer behavior, or other changes in supply or demand can adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates. Economic uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for our assets could cause customers to request shorter lease terms and lower lease rates, which may result in a decrease in our asset utilization rate and reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low lease rates for longer terms, which may result in an adverse impact on current or future revenues. Weak economic conditions in the US or other parts of the world and other factors may decrease customer demand for our assets and services and negatively impact our business and results of operations.We rely on continued demand from our customers to lease our railcars and locomotives. Demand for these assets and services depends on the markets for our customers’ products and services and the strength and growth of their businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, energy, chemical, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease certain types of railcars that are either returned at the end of a lease term or returned as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.Additional factors, such as changes in harvest or production volumes, changes in supply chains, choices in types of transportation assets, availability of substitutes and other operational needs may also influence customer demand for our assets. Demand for our marine assets and shipping services also depends on the factors discussed above. Significant declines in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance. In many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including anticipated changes to lease accounting rules, could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease. Adverse changes in the price of, or demand for, crude oil or other commodities could reduce demand for our railcars and have a negative impact on our results of operations.Adverse changes in commodity prices or reduced demand for commodities could reduce customer demand for various types of railcars in our fleet. A significant decrease in the price of a commodity may cause producers of that commodity to cut their production levels. A significant increase in the price of a commodity could cause our customers to switch to less expensive alternatives that are not delivered by rail. In each case, these changes in customer behavior can reduce demand for the portions of our fleet that are used to transport the commodity. Demand for railcars that are used to transport crude oil and related products, including commodities used in drilling operations and the commodities produced by such operations, is dependent on the demand for these commodities. While only about 1.7% of our worldwide fleet is engaged in direct crude-by-rail service, approximately 21% of our North American fleet is leased to petroleum-related customers, making them an important source of our worldwide revenue. Sustained low oil prices could cause oil producers to curtail the drilling of new wells or cease production at certain existing wells that are uneconomical to operate at current crude price levels. Reduced oil drilling activity could result in decreased demand for our railcars used to transport the commodities used in drilling operations, such as frac sand and fracking chemicals, and the commodities produced by such operations, including crude oil and refined products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, petrochemicals and liquefied petroleum gas. A significant and sustained decrease in the price of crude oil and related products could reduce customer demand for our railcars and negatively impact revenue and our results of operations. 14Demand for railcars that are used to transport ethanol and other renewable fuels may be affected by government subsidies and mandates, which may be enacted, changed, or eliminated from time to time. It is possible that the reduction or elimination of current US mandates for ethanol blending in motor fuels could reduce the production of ethanol, which would reduce demand for portions of our tank car fleet and negatively impact our revenue and profitability. Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, or industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.   A significant decrease in lease renewals by our customers or a significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring compliance-based maintenance could negatively impact operations and substantially increase our costs. Decreases in customer demand for our railcars could increase the number of leases that are not renewed upon expiration and could cause some customers to default, resulting in the early return of railcars. Railcars that are returned by our customers often must undergo maintenance and service work before being leased to new customers. A significant increase in the number of railcars requiring maintenance may negatively affect our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, low demand for certain types of railcars in our fleet may make those railcars more difficult to lease to new customers if they are returned at the end of their existing leases or following a customer default, which could negatively affect our results of operations. We also perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our full-service tank cars based on their service time. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the volume of tank cars requiring extensive maintenance in any given year. A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring maintenance may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we have contracted with third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures to the extent our demand exceeds our owned maintenance capacity, high demand faced by these providers from other tank car owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Our long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we regularly enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. Some of these agreements may provide for flexibility in the pricing, timing, and quantity of our purchasing commitments, while other agreements may provide no such flexibility. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars and our financing costs may be high, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability. Soft market conditions and declines in asset values may reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income. We utilize our extensive knowledge and experience to remarket rail assets in order to optimize the composition of our fleet, and these activities generate income that contributes significantly to Rail North America’s segment profit.  Reduced demand for our assets due to adverse market conditions could reduce opportunities for us to generate remarketing income.  A significant or prolonged decline in the secondary market for our assets could adversely affect our financial performance.  15We have significant financial exposure related to the performance of our aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc (“Rolls Royce”) each own 50% of fifteen domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates”) that own and lease aircraft engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. These investments expose us to various risks associated with the commercial aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations unique to that industry. The financial results of the RRPF affiliates depend heavily on the performance of Rolls-Royce, as Rolls-Royce is both a major customer of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the RRPF affiliates. The RRPF affiliates contribute significantly to our profit. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF affiliates deteriorates, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the US dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit our exposure to foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may or may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. We have generally been successful in negotiating acceptable agreements with the unions without experiencing material work stoppages. However, if we fail to negotiate acceptable new agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Changes in railroad efficiency may adversely affect demand for our railcars.Railroad infrastructure investments that improve efficiency or declines in rail traffic due to decreased demand could increase the average speed at which railroads can operate their trains, which may reduce the number of railcars needed for railroads to haul the same amount of cargo. Adverse weather conditions, railroad mergers, and increases in rail traffic could result in slower transit times making rail transportation less attractive to shippers versus other modes of transport. In each case, these changes could reduce demand for our railcars and negatively impact revenue and our results of operations.New rules in the US and Canada applicable to tank cars carrying crude oil, ethanol, and other flammable liquids could negatively impact our tank car fleet in flammable liquids service.Recently adopted legislation and regulations in the US and Canada established new design standards for tank cars used to transport various flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol. Existing tank cars in flammables service that were built prior to the adoption of the new design standards must be modified or removed from service between May, 2017, and May, 2029, depending on the type of car, the type of commodity carried, and whether the car is used in the US, Canada, or both countries. We have a fleet of approximately 125,000 railcars in North America, including approximately 13,900 tank cars currently used to transport flammable liquids that are affected by the new rules, of which approximately 4,300 are moving crude oil and ethanol. Over 90% of our affected tank cars have a compliance deadline of 2023 or later. We expect to modify some of the most modern of our affected cars tank cars to comply with the new standards.  However, for the majority of the affected cars, we currently anticipate retiring, redeploying, or selling them rather than performing retrofits. The additional costs to modify certain tank cars and the cost of retiring tank cars early could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. 16Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to secure financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. If we are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment regularly, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by managementCompetition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization and investment volume.Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international rail growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with US laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Failure to develop and maintain data management practices that comply with laws related to cybersecurity, privacy, data localization, and data protection•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States17We have been and may continue to be involved in various types of litigation.The nature of our business and our assets potentially exposes us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of lawsuits inside and outside the US. Customers may use certain types of our railcars to transport crude oil and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving a railcar carrying such materials could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability, particularly where the accident involves serious personal injuries or the loss of life. Our failure to maintain railcars in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules could also expose us to fines and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental damage. In some jurisdictions, an accident can give rise to both civil and criminal liabilities for us and, in some cases, our employees. In the event of an unfavorable outcome, we could be subject to substantial damages, including criminal penalties and fines, and our employees who are named as criminal defendants in any such litigation may be subject to incarceration and fines. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.Our rail and marine assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our rail and marine operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In North America, our railcar and locomotive fleet and operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards, rules, and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the US Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the US Department of Transportation, Transport Canada, and the Association of American Railroads. State and provincial agencies regulate some health and safety matters related to rail operations not otherwise preempted by federal law. Our business and railcar and locomotive fleet may be adversely impacted by new rules or regulations, or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our railcars, or could make certain types of railcars inoperable or obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to the end of their useful lives. In addition, violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.Similarly, our marine assets and operations are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, US citizen ownership requirements, emissions, ballast discharges, and other environmental and operational matters enforced by various federal and state agencies, including the Maritime Administration of the US Department of Transportation, the US Coast Guard, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, we could be prohibited from operating or leasing marine assets in the US market, and under certain circumstances, could incur severe fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.In addition, our foreign operations are subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where we do business. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations, or if they change in the future, the use of our assets could be restricted, or the economic value of our assets may be reduced. These restrictions or reductions could lead to loss of revenue or cause us to incur significant expenses to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, and regulations, or actions, could result in the obsolescence of various assets or impose compliance costs that are significant enough to render those assets economically obsolete.We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by purchasing insurance. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.18We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes, which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. Additionally, we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and costs arising out of third-party claims for property or natural resource damage and personal injury as a result of violations of or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations in connection with our or our lessees’ current or historical operations. Under some environmental laws in the United States and certain other countries, the owner of a leased railcar may be liable for environmental damage, cleanup or other costs in the event of a spill or discharge of material from a railcar without regard to the owner's fault. We routinely assess environmental liabilities, including our potential obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites and the possible amount of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due to the regulatory complexities, risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties and the potential liability for the operations of our lessees, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated. The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived assets such as railcars, marine vessels, and other equipment. The carrying value of these assets in our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. Our assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our rail and marine assets. A reduction in customer demand or change in customers' preferred method of product transportation could result in the economic obsolescence of the assets leased by those customers.Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact business operations, which could result in increases in costs and decreases in revenues.The success of our ASC subsidiary depends on the efficiency of its operations on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, such as high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions may restrict the volume that ASC's vessels can transport per trip. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.We are subject to the inherent risks of our affiliate investments.We are indirectly exposed to risks through our ownership interests in affiliates, as our affiliates may experience many of the same risks discussed in this ""Risk Factors
"" section. Rolls-Royce manages our RRPF affiliates, and we sometimes retain third parties to manage assets we own directly, such as our ocean-going vessels. Poor business or financial results of these affiliates, or the third parties who manage, operate, or invest along with us in these affiliates, could negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, when a third party manages or operates an affiliate or asset, we may not have control over operational matters related to the affiliate or asset, which could result in actions that have an adverse economic impact on the affiliate, the asset, or GATX or could expose GATX to potential liability. 19We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy. Customers' increased costs could reduce their demand to lease our assets. In addition, railcars in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if new government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. New government regulations could also increase our marine and other operating costs and compliance with those regulations could be costly. Potential consequences of laws, rules, or regulations addressing climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.Five shareholders collectively control more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the US and foreign countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate.We are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, material audit assessments, or legislative changes that impact statutory tax rates, which could include an impact on previously-recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities. Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted.We cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or deflation will have on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail and marine assets has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks, which could lead to the following:20•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of railcars and marine vessels•A decrease in demand for rail and marine services•Lower utilization of rail and marine equipment•Lower rail lease and marine charter rates•Impairments of rail and marine assets or capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A downturn in the commercial aviation industry, which could lead to adverse financial results for our RRPF affiliates.Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.We rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations. If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our IT infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted. We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is critical to all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. Although we have taken steps to mitigate these risks, we may not be able to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information and subject us to potential lawsuits or other material legal liabilities. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. Although management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of error"

 Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Regulatory authorities in the US and Canada have proposed new rules that would apply to tank cars carrying crude oil, ethanol, and other flammable liquids and any new regulations could negatively impact our tank car fleet in flammable liquids service.Derailments involving trains carrying crude oil and ethanol have led to increased regulatory scrutiny of railroad operations, shippers’ classification of products, and the tank cars carrying these commodities. Regulatory authorities in the US and Canada have proposed new rules that would require modifications to certain existing tank cars used to transport various flammable liquids, including crude oil and ethanol.  While we cannot predict the content of the final rules, the US Department of Transportation is projecting that final rules will be issued in the second quarter of 2015.  We are currently assessing the changes to tank car design standards proposed by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the US Department of Transportation (""PHMSA"") and Transport Canada (""TC"") and evaluating their potential impact on our tank car fleet in flammable liquids service. We have a fleet of more than 126,000 railcars in North America, including approximately 13,600 tank cars currently used to transport flammable liquids, of which approximately 4,900 are moving crude oil and ethanol. The impact of the new rules will vary depending on the age and particular characteristics of each tank car and the commodities that are transported by the tank car. For example, the new regulations may require that tank cars be refurbished or substantially modified if they are to remain engaged in crude, ethanol and other flammable liquid service, and certain cars may need to be retired prior to the end of their previously estimated useful lives. In addition, it is possible that new regulatory requirements for shipping crude, ethanol and other flammable liquids in tank cars may result in our customers’ shifting some the volume of these commodities that currently travel by rail to other modes of transportation, resulting in decreased demand for these tank cars.  The additional costs to refurbish or modify certain tank cars and the cost of retiring other tank cars early could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.  Weak economic conditions, financial market volatility, and other factors may decrease customer demand for our assets and services and negatively impact our business and results of operations.We rely on continued demand from our customers to lease our railcars, locomotives, marine assets, and other equipment. Demand for these assets depends on the markets for our customers’ products and services and the strength and growth of their businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, chemical, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease certain types of railcars that are either returned at the end of a lease term or returned as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.In many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including potential changes to lease accounting rules, could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease.Additional factors, such as changes in harvest or production volumes, changes in supply chains, choices in types of transportation assets, availability of substitutes and other operational needs may also influence customer demand for our assets. Demand for our marine assets and shipping services also depends on the factors discussed above. Significant declines in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.14We may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates.Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates, sell assets, and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Circumstances such as economic downturns, changes in customer behavior, excess capacity in particular railcar types or generally in the marketplace, or other changes in supply or demand can adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates. Economic uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for our assets could cause customers to request shorter lease terms and lower lease rates, which may result in a decrease in our asset utilization rate and reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low lease rates for longer terms, which may result in an adverse impact on current or future revenues.Our rail and marine assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our rail and marine operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In the United States, our railcar and locomotive fleet and operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards, rules, and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the US Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, PHMSA, TC, and the Association of American Railroads. State agencies regulate some health and safety matters related to rail operations not otherwise preempted by federal law. Our business and railcar and locomotive fleet may be adversely impacted by new rules or regulations, or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our railcars, or could make certain types of railcars inoperable or obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to the end of their useful lives. In addition, violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.Similarly, our marine assets and operations are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, US citizen ownership requirements, emissions, ballast discharges, and other environmental and operational matters enforced by various federal and state agencies, including the Maritime Administration of the US Department of Transportation, the US Coast Guard, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, we could be prohibited from operating or leasing marine assets in the US market, and under certain circumstances, could incur severe fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.In addition, our foreign operations are subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where we do business. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations, or if they change in the future, the use of our assets could be restricted, or the economic value of our assets may be reduced. These restrictions or reductions could lead to loss of revenue or cause us to incur significant expenses to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, and regulations, or actions, could result in the obsolescence of various assets or impose compliance costs that are significant enough to render those assets economically obsolete.A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring compliance-based maintenance could negatively impact operations and substantially increase costs.We perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our full-service tank cars based on their service time. New government regulations or industry rules are sometimes enacted, which may affect the number and type of procedures we are required to perform. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the volume of tank cars requiring extensive maintenance in any given year. A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring maintenance may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we have contracted with third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures, high demand faced by these providers from other tank car owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Our access to newly built railcars may be limited, and long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. Our ability to acquire newly built railcars could be limited if we are unable to acquire railcars from manufacturers on competitive terms.15In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly built railcars on competitive terms, we sometimes enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly built railcars over a multi-year period. In many cases, we cannot cancel or materially reduce our orders under these purchase commitments. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, it is possible that we may be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease such railcars and our financing costs may be high, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to secure financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. If we are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, or industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations. A significant and sustained decrease in the price of crude oil and related products could reduce customer demand for our railcars.  Demand for railcars that are used to transport crude oil and related products, including frac sand, ethanol and other petrochemical products, is dependent on the demand for these commodities. While only about 1.7% of our worldwide fleet is engaged in direct crude-by-rail service, approximately 18% of our North American fleet is leased to petroleum-related customers, making them an important source of our worldwide revenue. Sustained low oil prices could cause oil producers to curtail the drilling of new wells or cease production at certain existing wells that are uneconomical to operate at current crude price levels. Reduced oil drilling activity could result in decreased demand for our railcars used to transport the commodities used in drilling operations, such as frac sand, and the commodities produced by such operations, including crude oil and other products associated with the petroleum industry such as ethanol, gasoline, diesel fuel, petrochemicals and liquefied petroleum gas.. Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international rail growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with United States laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base16•Imposition of sanctions against countries where we operate or specific companies or individuals with whom we do business•Nationalization or confiscation of assets by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States  Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted. We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment regularly, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:•A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by managementOur assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our rail and marine assets. A reduction in customer demand or change in customers' preferred method of product transportation could result in the economic obsolescence of the assets leased by those customers.We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes which may have resulted in discharges onto these properties. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own or use. We routinely assess environmental liabilities, including our potential obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites and the possible amount of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminants on our properties, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.We have been and may continue to be involved in various types of litigation.The nature of our businesses and our assets potentially expose us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of litigation. Customers may use certain types of our railcars to transport crude oil and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving a railcar carrying such materials could lead to litigation and subject us to significant liability, particularly where the accident involves serious personal injuries or the loss of life. Our failure to maintain railcars in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules could also expose us to personal injury, property damage, and environmental claims. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. 17We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by insuring our assets. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain, thereby increasing our exposure to uninsured adverse judgments and other losses and liabilities that could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived assets such as railcars, marine vessels, and other equipment. The carrying value of these assets in our financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets.Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the US dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.We are subject to the inherent risks of our affiliate investments.We are indirectly exposed to risks through our ownership interests in affiliates, as our affiliates may experience many of the same risks discussed in this ""Risk Factors
"" section. Third parties manage and operate many of our affiliates, and we sometimes retain third parties to manage assets we own directly, such as our ocean-going vessels. Some of those third parties may be smaller than we are and have fewer financial resources. Poor business or financial results of these affiliates, or the third parties who manage, operate, or invest along with us in these affiliates, could negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, when a third party manages and operates an affiliate or asset, we may not have control over operational matters related to the affiliate or asset, which could result in actions that have an adverse economic impact on the affiliate, the asset, or GATX or could expose GATX to potential liability.We have significant financial exposure related to the performance of our aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.GATX and Rolls-Royce plc (“Rolls Royce”) each own 50% of fourteen domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates”) that own and lease aircraft engines to Rolls-Royce and owners and operators of commercial aircraft. These investments expose us to various risks associated with the commercial aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations unique to that industry. The financial results of the RRPF affiliates depend heavily on the performance of Rolls-Royce, as Rolls-Royce is both a major customer of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the RRPF affiliates. The RRPF affiliates contribute significantly to our profit. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF affiliates deteriorated, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In certain cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization and investment volume.18We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change.  Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy. Customers' increased costs could reduce their demand to lease our assets. In addition, railcars in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if new government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. New government regulations could also increase our marine and other operating costs, either directly or through our joint venture entities, or compliance with those regulations could be costly. Potential consequences of laws, rules, or regulations addressing climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.Six shareholders collectively control more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.We cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or deflation will have on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail, marine, and other equipment has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. Conversely, a period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above. High energy prices could reduce the demand for our products and services.The price of natural gas is a significant cost driver for many of our customers, either directly in the form of raw material costs in industries such as the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the form of increased transportation costs. Sustained high energy prices could negatively impact these industries resulting in a reduction in customer demand for our assets and related services.Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact business operations, which could result in increases in costs and decreases in revenues.The success of our ASC subsidiary depends on the efficiency of its operations on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, such as high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions may restrict the volume that ASC's vessels can transport per trip. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. We have generally been successful in negotiating acceptable agreements with the unions without experiencing material work stoppages. However, if we fail to negotiate acceptable new agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.19Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.Changes in the mix of earnings in the US and foreign countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate.We are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates. Our effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, material audit assessments, or legislative changes that impact statutory tax rates, which could include an impact on previously-recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.We could be adversely affected by United States and global political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of railcars and marine vessels•A decrease in demand for rail and marine services•Lower utilization of rail and marine equipment•Lower rail lease and marine charter rates•Impairments of rail and marine assets or capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets •A downturn in the commercial aviation industry, which could lead to adverse financial results for our RRPF affiliates.  Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.We rely on technology in all aspects of our business operations.  If we are unable to adequately maintain and secure our IT infrastructure from cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, our business could be negatively impacted.We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is critical to all aspects of our business operations, including employee and customer information. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to these systems. Although we have taken steps to mitigate these risks, we may not be able to prevent breaches of our IT infrastructure, some of which is managed by third parties. Breaches of our IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential employee and customer information stored on our IT systems or confidential data or other business information. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations.Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. Although management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of error.20"
12,GATX,GATX CORP,2014-02-25,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 Investors should consider the risk factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing or our other filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission before investing in our securities. If any of the events described in the risk factors below occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future growth prospects could be adversely affected. Recent derailments of trains carrying crude oil have resulted in product releases, fires and serious damage. Regulations applicable to tank cars carrying crude oil, ethanol, and other flammable liquids are currently under review and any new regulations could negatively impact our tank car fleet in flammable liquids service.  Recent derailments involving trains carrying crude oil and ethanol have led to increased regulatory scrutiny of railroad operations, shippers’ classification of products, and the tank cars carrying these commodities. The nature and scope of regulatory action is currently unknown, and we cannot predict how any new rules or regulations might impact our fleet of tank cars. We have approximately 4,000 tank cars currently in crude and ethanol service and another 8,000 cars in flammable liquids service. New regulations could have an adverse impact on our business by requiring us to refurbish or substantially modify tank cars that are engaged in crude, ethanol and other flammable liquid service, and certain cars may need to be retired prior to the end of their useful lives. In addition, if the regulatory requirements for shipping crude, ethanol and other flammable commodities in tank cars become too onerous, our customers may shift some of the commodities that currently travel by rail to other modes of transportation, resulting in decreased demand for these tank cars.     Competition could result in decreased profitability.We operate in a highly competitive business environment. In many cases, our competitors are larger than we are and have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings, and a lower cost of capital. These factors may enable our competitors to offer leases and loans to customers at lower rates than we can provide, thus negatively impacting our profitability, asset utilization and investment volume.  Weak economic conditions, financial market volatility, and other factors may decrease customer demand for our assets and services and negatively impact our business and results of operations.  We rely on continued demand from our customers to lease our railcars, locomotives, marine assets, and other equipment. Demand for these assets depends on the markets for our customers’ products and services and the strength and growth of their businesses. Some of our customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, chemical, and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns and may experience significant changes in demand over time. Weakness in certain sectors of the economy in the United States and other parts of the world may make it more difficult for us to lease certain types of railcars that are either returned at the end of a lease term or returned as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.  In many cases, demand for our assets also depends on our customers’ desire to lease, rather than buy, the assets. Tax and accounting considerations, interest rates, and operational flexibility, among other factors, may influence a customer’s decision to lease or buy assets. We have no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including potential changes to lease accounting rules, could negatively impact demand for our assets held for lease.Additional factors, such as changes in harvest or production volumes, changes in supply chains, choices in types of transportation assets, availability of substitutes and other operational needs may also influence customer demand for our assets. Demand for our marine assets and shipping services also depends on the factors discussed above. Significant declines in customer demand for our assets and services could adversely affect our financial performance.  We may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates.Our profitability depends on our ability to lease assets at satisfactory rates, sell assets, and to re-lease assets upon lease expiration. Circumstances such as economic downturns, changes in customer behavior, excess capacity in particular railcar types or generally in the marketplace, or other changes in supply or demand can adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates. Economic uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for our assets could cause customers to request shorter lease terms and lower lease rates, which may result in a decrease in our asset utilization rate and reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low lease rates for longer terms, which may result in an adverse impact on current or future revenues. 14Our rail and marine assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations. If these laws rules, and regulations change or we fail to comply with them, it could have a significant negative effect on our business and profitability.Our rail and marine operations are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where we do business. In the United States, our railcar fleet and operations are subject to safety, operations, maintenance, and mechanical standards, rules, and regulations enforced by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the US Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and the Association of American Railroads. State agencies regulate some health and safety matters related to rail operations not otherwise preempted by federal law. Our business and railcar fleet may be adversely impacted by new rules or regulations, or changes to existing rules or regulations, which could require additional maintenance or substantial modification or refurbishment of our railcars, or could make certain types of railcars inoperable or obsolete or require them to be phased out prior to the end of their useful lives. In addition, violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets. Similarly, our marine assets and operations are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, citizenship, emissions, ballast discharges, and other environmental and operational matters enforced by various federal and state agencies, including the Maritime Administration of the US Department of Transportation, the US Coast Guard, and the US Environmental Protection Agency. If we fail to comply with these rules and regulations, we could be prohibited from operating or leasing marine assets in the US market, and under certain circumstances, could incur severe fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.      In addition, our foreign operations are subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where we do business. If we fail to comply with these laws, rules, and regulations, or if there are future changes to them, the use of our assets could be restricted, or the economic value of our assets may be reduced. These restrictions or reductions could lead to loss of revenue or cause us to incur significant expenses to comply with laws, rules, and regulations, thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, and regulations, or actions, could result in the obsolescence of various assets or impose compliance costs that are significant enough to render those assets economically obsolete. A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring compliance-based maintenance could negatively impact operations and substantially increase costs.  We perform a variety of government or industry-mandated maintenance programs on our full-service tank cars based on their service time. New government regulations or industry rules are sometimes enacted, which may affect the number and type of procedures we are required to perform. These compliance programs are cyclical in nature, and as a result, we can face significant increases in the volume of tank cars requiring extensive maintenance in any given year. A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring maintenance may negatively impact our operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs. In addition, while we have contracted with third party maintenance providers to assist with these compliance procedures, high demand faced by these providers from other tank car owners may constrain our access to the providers or may substantially increase our costs.Our access to newly-built railcars may be limited, and long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject us to material operational and financial risks.  Unlike some of our competitors in the railcar leasing market, we do not manufacture railcars. Our ability to acquire newly-built railcars could be limited if we are unable to acquire railcars from manufacturers on competitive terms.  In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly-built railcars on competitive terms, we sometimes enter into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly-built railcars over a multi-year period. We cannot generally cancel or materially reduce our orders under these purchase commitments. Therefore, if economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, manufacturers would require us to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it may be difficult for us to lease the railcars and our financing costs may be high, which could negatively affect our revenues and profitability.  15 Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets or negative changes in our credit ratings may limit our ability to secure financing and may increase our borrowing costs.We rely largely on banks and capital markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be limited for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, changes in our financial performance or credit ratings or ratings outlook, as determined by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Service, could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs or to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for secured and unsecured debt. If we are unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, our other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations, and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund our operations and contractual commitments.  Events that negatively affect certain assets, customers, or geographic regions could have a negative impact on our results of operations.We generally derive our revenues from a variety of asset types, customers, industries, and geographic locations. However, from time to time we could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a specific asset type, customer, or industry, or region in which we have a concentrated exposure could negatively impact our results of operations.  Risks related to our international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.  We generate a significant amount of our net income outside the United States. In recent years, we have increased our focus on international rail growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings. Our foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to the following risks associated with international operations:•Noncompliance with United States laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act•Noncompliance with a variety of local laws and regulations•Failure to properly implement changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws•Fluctuations in currency values•Sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls•Discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies•Difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of our assets in certain jurisdictions•Uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles that may be more prevalent in foreign countries•Ineffective or delayed implementation of appropriate controls, policies, and processes across our diverse operations and employee base•Nationalization of properties by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers, and similar restrictions on our operations outside the United States  Moreover, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption, and other economic or political uncertainties could interrupt and negatively affect our business operations.  Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these conditions or events, the adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material.  Our allowance for losses may be inadequate.Our allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate to cover credit losses in our portfolio if unexpected adverse changes occur in macroeconomic conditions or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates, it may require us to incur additional credit losses and our financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted. 16We may incur future asset impairment charges.We review long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment regularly, or when circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. Among other circumstances, the following may change our estimates of the cash flows we expect our long-lived assets or joint venture investments will generate, which could require us to recognize asset impairment charges:  •A weak economic environment or challenging market conditions•New laws, rules or regulations affecting our assets, or changes to existing laws, rules or regulations•Events related to particular customers or asset types•Asset or portfolio sale decisions by managementOur assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules, and regulations that may make assets obsolete, changes in the preferred method our customers use to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them may adversely impact us. Our customers' industries are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are influenced by economic and political factors. Changes in our customers' markets may significantly affect demand for our rail and marine assets. A reduction in customer demand or change in customers' preferred method of product transportation could result in the economic obsolescence of the assets leased by those customers.  We are subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.We are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of our properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes which may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties in addition to properties we currently own and use. We routinely assess environmental liabilities, including our potential obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites and the possible amount of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminants on its properties, it is possible environmental and remediation costs may be materially different from the costs we have estimated.We have been and may continue to be involved in various types of litigation.The nature of our businesses and our assets potentially expose us to significant personal injury and property damage claims and litigation, environmental claims, or other types of litigation. Customers may use certain types of our railcars to transport crude oil and other hazardous materials, and an accident involving a railcar carrying such materials could lead to litigation and subject us significant liability, particularly where the accident involves serious personal injuries or the loss of life. Our failure to maintain railcars in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules could also expose us to personal injury, property damage, and environmental claims. A substantial adverse judgment against us could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. High energy prices could reduce the demand for our products and services.The price of natural gas and oil are significant cost drivers for many of our customers, either directly in the form of raw material costs in industries such as the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the form of increased transportation costs. Sustained high energy prices could negatively impact these industries resulting in a reduction in customer demand for our assets and related services. We may not be able to obtain cost-effective insurance.We manage our exposure to risk, in part, by insuring our assets. There is no guarantee that cost-effective insurance will consistently be available. If insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, we could be forced to reduce our coverage amount and increase the amount of self-insured risk we retain. 17The fair market value of our long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in our financial statements.Our assets primarily consist of long-lived assets such as railcars, marine vessels, and industrial equipment. The carrying value of these assets in the financial statements may sometimes differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and could be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could negatively impact our results of operations.Upon consolidation, we translate the financial results of certain subsidiaries from their local currency to the US dollar, which exposes us to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. As exchange rates vary, the translated operating results of foreign subsidiaries may differ materially from period to period. We also have gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can affect the demand and price for services we provide both domestically and internationally, and could negatively impact on our results of operations. We also face risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. We may seek to limit foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk with currency or interest rate derivatives, which may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect our financial performance.  We are subject to the inherent risks of our affiliate investments.We are indirectly exposed to risks through our ownership interests in affiliates, as our affiliates may experience many of the same risks discussed in this ""Risk Factors
"" section. Third parties manage and operate many of our affiliates, and those third parties may be smaller than us and have fewer financial resources. Poor business or financial results of these affiliates, or the third parties who manage, operate, or invest along with us in these affiliates, could negatively impact our financial results. Additionally, when a third party manages and operates the affiliate, we may not have control over our affiliates' operational matters, which could result in affiliate actions that have an adverse economic impact on us or expose us to potential liability. We have significant financial exposure related to the performance of our aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.  GATX and Rolls-Royce each own 50% of fourteen domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF affiliates”) that own and lease aircraft engines to Rolls-Royce and other owners and operators of commercial aircraft. These investments expose us to various risks associated with the commercial aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations unique to that industry. The financial results of the RRPF affiliates depend heavily on the performance of Rolls-Royce, as Rolls-Royce is both a major customer of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the RRPF affiliates. The RRPF affiliates contribute significantly to our profit. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF affiliates deteriorated, our results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected. We may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change. Changes in laws, rules, and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules, or regulations, to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could negatively impact our customers and business. For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly increase costs for our customers whose production processes require significant amounts of energy. Customers' increased costs could reduce their demand to lease our assets. In addition, railcars in our fleet that are used to carry fossil fuels, such as coal and petroleum, could see reduced demand if new government regulations mandate a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. New government regulations could also increase our marine and other operating costs, either directly or through our joint venture entities, or compliance with those regulations could be costly. Potential consequences of laws, rules, or regulations addressing climate change could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows. A small number of shareholders could significantly influence our business.  Six shareholders collectively control more than 50% of our outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.   18We cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or deflation will have on our financial results.The timing and duration of the effects of inflation are unpredictable and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail, marine, and other equipment has historically benefited our financial results. However, these benefits may be offset by increases in the costs for goods and services we purchase, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, maintenance and repair services, and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in our cost of goods and services could adversely impact our financial performance. A period of prolonged deflation could negatively impact our lease rate pricing, residual values, and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset by decreases to our costs for goods and services, including those listed above.Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact business operations, which could result in increases in costs and decreases in revenues.The success of our ASC subsidiary depends on the efficiency of its operations on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, such as high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions may restrict the volume that ASC's vessels can transport per trip. These conditions could negatively impact our results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.  Many of our employees are represented by unions, and failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages, or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of our employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, such as wages, health and welfare benefits, and work rules. We have generally been successful in negotiating acceptable agreements with the unions without experiencing material work stoppages. However, if we fail to negotiate acceptable new agreements, our business could be disrupted by strikes or lockouts. We could also incur increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers. Business disruptions or higher operating costs could both have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements, and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect our results of operations.We calculate our pension and other post-retirement costs using various assumptions, such as discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates, and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations. Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate we use to calculate our funding obligations, which may increase our funding requirements. Additionally, changes to laws, regulations, or rules could require us to increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If we were forced to increase contributions to our pension plans, our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be negatively affected.  Changes in the mix of earnings in the US and foreign countries could adversely affect our effective tax rate.We are subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates. The effective tax rate could also be adversely affected by changes in tax laws, material audit assessments, or legislative changes that impact statutory tax rates, which could include an impact on previously-recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities.We could be adversely affected by United States and global economic and political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war.We may be adversely affected by national and international political developments, instability, and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks, which could lead to the following:•Legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of railcars and marine vessels19•A decrease in demand for rail and marine services•Lower utilization of rail and marine equipment•Lower rail lease and marine charter rates•Impairments of rail and marine assets or capital market disruption, which may raise our financing costs or limit our access to capital•Liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving our assets Depending upon the severity, scope, and duration of these circumstances, the impact on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows could be material. Security threats, including cybersecurity threats and related disruptions, could negatively impact our business.We rely on our IT infrastructure to process, transmit, and store electronic information that is critical to our business' operations. All IT systems are vulnerable to security threats, such as hacking, viruses, malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to systems. Breaches of IT infrastructure could lead to disruptions in our business, potentially including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation, or release of confidential data or other business information. These disruptions could adversely affect our operations, financial position, and results of operations. Our internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and related regulations. Although management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of internal control provides absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of error"
17,GATX,GATX CORP,2013-02-26,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 GATX is subject to a number of risks that investors should consider before investing in GATX’s securities. These risks include the factors described below as well as other information contained in this filing and GATX’s other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of the events described below were to occur, GATX’s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer. Competition could result in decreased profitability.GATX operates in a highly competitive business environment. In many cases, competitors are larger entities that have greater financial resources, higher credit ratings and a lower cost of capital than GATX. These factors may enable competitors to offer leases and loans to customers at lower rates than GATX is able to provide, thus impacting GATX’s asset utilization or GATX’s ability to lease assets on a profitable basis.  Weak economic conditions, financial market volatility and other factors may decrease customer demand for GATX’s assets and services and negatively impact GATX’s business and results of operations.  GATX relies upon continued demand from its customers to lease its railcars, locomotives, marine assets and other equipment. Demand for these assets is dependent upon the markets for the products and services offered by the Company’s customers and the strength and growth of their businesses. A number of GATX’s customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, chemical and construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the United States and abroad and may experience significant changes in demand over time.Weak economic conditions in the United States and other parts of the world in recent years have reduced demand from certain GATX customers for the types of assets and services GATX provides. Continued weakness in certain sectors of the economy also may make it more difficult for GATX to lease certain types of railcars that are returned either at the end of a lease term or as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.  In Europe, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis, the loss of value by the Euro and related effects on the European banking system have contributed to growing instability in the European currency and credit markets.  Further deterioration of European economic conditions or significant loss of value by the Euro could reduce demand for the Company’s European rail assets.  In many cases, demand for GATX’s assets is also dependent on customers’ desire to lease, rather than purchase assets. There are a number of items that factor into the customer’s decision to lease or purchase assets, such as tax and accounting considerations, interest rates and operational flexibility. GATX has no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including potential changes to lease accounting rules, could negatively impact demand for its assets held for lease.Additional factors influencing customer demand for GATX’s assets include changes in production volumes, potential changes in supply chains, choices regarding type of transportation asset, availability of substitutes and other operational needs. Demand for the marine assets and shipping services provided by the Company and its marine joint ventures is also dependent upon the factors discussed above. A significant decline in customer demand for the assets and services provided by GATX could adversely affect the Company’s financial performance.   12GATX may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates.GATX’s profitability is largely dependent on its ability to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates and to re-lease or sell assets upon lease expiration. A number of factors can adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates, including, but not limited to, an economic downturn causing reduced demand, changes in customer behavior, excess capacity in the marketplace or other changes in supply or demand for such assets. Economic uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for GATX’s assets could cause customers to demand shorter lease terms and lower lease rates and could result in a decrease in the utilization rate for GATX’s assets and reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low lease rates for longer terms thereby resulting in an adverse impact on current or future revenues.GATX’s access to newly-built railcars may be limited, and long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject GATX to material operational and financial risks.  Unlike certain of its competitors in the railcar leasing market, GATX does not manufacture railcars. GATX’s ability to acquire newly-built railcars could be limited if the Company is unable to procure railcars from manufacturers on competitive terms.  In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly-built railcars on competitive terms, GATX from time to time enters into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant numbers of newly-built railcars over a multi-year period. The Company’s purchase commitments under these long-term agreements generally are not subject to cancellation or material reduction by GATX. If economic conditions weaken during the term of a long-term supply agreement, GATX would be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it is difficult for the Company to place the railcars with customers and the Company’s financing costs may be unattractively high. GATX’s rail and marine assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules and regulations, and failure to comply with, or changes to, these laws, rules or regulations could have a significant negative effect on GATX’s business and profitability.GATX’s rail and marine operations are subject to various laws, rules and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where GATX does business. In the United States, GATX’s railcar fleet and operations are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, operations, maintenance and mechanical standards promulgated by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Association of American Railroads. In addition, state agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety matters not otherwise preempted by federal law. GATX’s business operations and its railcar fleet may be adversely impacted by rules and regulations promulgated by these governmental and industry agencies, which could require substantial modification, maintenance or refurbishment of GATX’s railcars or potentially make such railcars inoperable or obsolete. Violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.     Similarly, GATX’s marine assets and operations are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which establish rules and regulations relating to safety, citizenship, emissions, ballast discharges and other environmental and operational matters. If GATX fails to comply with these rules and regulations, the Company could be prohibited from operating or leasing marine assets in the U.S. market and, under certain circumstances, could incur severe fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.      In addition, GATX’s foreign operations are subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where the Company does business. Failure to comply with, or future changes to, any of the foregoing laws, rules or regulations could restrict the use or reduce the economic value of GATX’s assets, including loss of revenue, or cause GATX to incur significant expenditures to comply, thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to laws, rules and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules or regulations, could result in the obsolescence of various assets or impose compliance costs that are so significant as to render such assets economically obsolete. A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring compliance-based maintenance could negatively impact operations and substantially increase costs.  GATX performs a variety of maintenance programs on its full-service tank cars based upon their service time that are mandated by government regulations and industry rules.  New government regulations or industry rules are enacted from time to time, which may  13affect the number and type of procedures required to be performed.  These compliance programs are cyclical in nature and as a result, GATX can face significant increases in the volume of tank cars requiring extensive maintenance in any given year.  A significant increase in the number of tank cars requiring maintenance may negatively impact GATX's operations and substantially increase maintenance and other related costs.  In addition, while GATX has contracted with third party maintenance providers to assist in performing these compliance procedures, GATX's access to these providers may be constrained or costs may increase substantially in times of high demand from other tank car owners for services from these same providers. Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets, weakening of macroeconomic conditions, and negative changes in credit ratings may limit the ability of GATX to secure financing and may increase its borrowing costs.GATX relies, in large part, upon banks and capital markets to fund its operations and contractual commitments, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. These markets can experience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, a number of other factors could cause GATX to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for both secured and unsecured debt. These factors include GATX’s financial performance and its credit ratings and rating outlook as determined primarily by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investor Service. If GATX is unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, the Company’s other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations and portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund its operations and contractual commitments.  GATX’s assets may become obsolete.In addition to changes in laws, rules and regulations that may make assets obsolete, GATX may be adversely impacted by changes in the preferred method used by the Company’s customers to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or by a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them from GATX. The industries in which GATX’s customers operate are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are in turn influenced by economic and political factors in the United States and abroad. Demand for GATX’s rail and marine assets may be significantly affected by changes in the markets in which the Company’s customers operate. A significant reduction in customer demand for transportation or manufacture of a particular product or change in the preferred method of transportation used by customers to ship their products could result in the economic obsolescence of GATX assets leased by those customers.  Events or conditions negatively affecting certain assets, customers or geographic regions in which GATX has a large investment could have a negative impact on its results of operations.GATX’s revenues are generally derived from a number of different asset types, customers, industries and geographic locations. However, from time to time, GATX could have a large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a particular asset type, discrete events with  respect to a specific customer or industry, or adverse regional economic conditions, particularly for those assets, customers or regions in which GATX has a concentrated exposure, could have a negative impact on GATX’s results of operations.  Risks related to GATX's international operations and expansion into new geographic markets could adversely affect GATX's business, financial condition and operating results.  GATX generates a significant amount of its net income outside the United States and in recent years has increased its focus on international rail growth and expansion into select emerging markets as a means to grow and diversify earnings.  GATX's foreign operations and international expansion strategy are subject to risks associated with international operations, including:  compliance with United States laws affecting operations outside of the United States, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; compliance with a variety of local laws and regulations; changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those laws; fluctuations in currency values; sudden changes in foreign currency exchange controls; discriminatory or conflicting fiscal policies; difficulties enforcing contractual rights or foreclosing to obtain the return of GATX assets in certain jurisdictions; greater risk of uncollectible accounts and longer collection cycles; effective and immediate implementation of appropriate controls, policies and processes across GATX's diverse operations and employee base; nationalization of properties by foreign governments, and imposition of additional or new tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and similar restrictions on GATX's sales outside the United States.  Moreover, political and economic changes or volatility, geopolitical regional conflicts, terrorist activity, political unrest, civil strife, acts of war, public corruption and other economic or political uncertainties could  14interrupt and negatively affect GATX's business operations.  Depending upon the severity, scope and duration of these conditions or events, the adverse impact on GATX's financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be material.  GATX’s allowance for losses may prove inadequate.GATX’s allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses in its portfolio if unexpected adverse changes in the economy differ from the expectations of management or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality of GATX’s customer base materially deteriorates, the Company may be required to provide for additional credit losses and GATX’s financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted. GATX may incur future asset impairment charges.GATX regularly reviews long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment, including when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. GATX may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of a weak economic environment, challenging market conditions, events related to particular customers or asset types, or as a result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management or other factors that affect GATX’s estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from its long-lived assets or joint venture investments.GATX is subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.GATX’s operations are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition, some of GATX’s properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties as well as properties currently owned and used by the Company. Environmental liabilities are routinely assessed, including obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites and assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminants on its properties, the potential exists for environmental and remediation costs to be materially different from the costs GATX has estimated.GATX has been, and may in the future be, involved in various types of litigation.The nature of GATX’s businesses and assets expose the Company to the potential for claims and litigation related to personal injury and property damage, environmental claims and various other matters. Certain GATX railcars may be used by customers to transport hazardous materials, and a rupture of a railcar carrying such materials in an accident could lead to litigation and subject GATX to the potential for significant liability.  GATX's failure to maintain railcars in compliance with governmental regulations and industry rules could expose the Company to personal injury, property damage and environmental claims.  A substantial adverse judgment against GATX could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. High energy prices could have a negative effect on the demand for GATX’s products and services.Energy prices, including the price of natural gas and oil, are significant cost drivers for many of GATX’s customers, either directly in the form of raw material costs in industries such as the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the form of increased transportation costs. Sustained high energy prices could negatively impact these industries resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on customer demand for GATX’s assets, as well as related services. GATX may not be able to procure insurance on a cost-effective basis.GATX manages its exposure to risk, in part, by insuring its assets and their associated risks. There is no guarantee that such insurance will be consistently available on a cost-effective basis in the future. If the cost of insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, GATX could be forced to reduce the amount of coverage and increase the amount of its self-insured risk retention.  15The fair market value of GATX’s long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assets reflected in its financial statements.GATX’s assets primarily consist of long-lived assets such as railcars, marine vessels and industrial equipment. The carrying value of these assets in the financial statements may at times differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and may be material based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could have a negative impact on GATX’s results of operations.GATX’s results are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of certain subsidiaries are translated from their local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, the operating results of foreign subsidiaries, when translated, may differ materially from period to period. GATX is also subject to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can have an effect on the demand and relative price for services provided by GATX domestically and internationally, and could have a negative impact on GATX’s results of operations. GATX is also subject to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company may seek to limit foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk through the use of currency or interest rate derivatives, but these measures may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect GATX’s financial performance.  GATX is subject to the inherent risks of its affiliate investments.GATX has investments in affiliated companies that are subject to many of the same risks discussed in this “Risk Factors
” section, and GATX is indirectly exposed to these risks through its ownership interests in these affiliates.  Many of these affiliates are managed and operated by third parties who may be smaller than GATX and have lesser financial resources.  Adverse developments in the business or financial results of these affiliates, or the third parties who manage, operate, or invest along with GATX in these affiliates, could have a negative impact on GATX’s financial results.  Additionally, where an affiliate is managed and operated by GATX’s partner in the affiliate or another third party, GATX may not have control over operational matters, which could result in actions taken at the affiliate level that may have an adverse economic impact on GATX or otherwise expose GATX to potential liability. GATX has significant financial exposure related to the performance of its aircraft engine leasing affiliate investments.  GATX and Rolls-Royce each own 50% of fourteen domestic and foreign joint venture entities (collectively, the “RRPF Affiliates”) that own and lease aircraft engines to Rolls-Royce and other owners and operators of commercial aircraft.  Through these investments, GATX is exposed to various risks associated with the commercial aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations unique to that industry. Further, the financial results of the RRPF Affiliates are heavily dependent on the performance of Rolls-Royce, which is both a major customer of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the RRPF Affiliates.  The RRPF Affiliates are significant contributors to GATX’s consolidated segment profit.  If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF Affiliates were to deteriorate, GATX’s results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected. GATX may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change. Changes in laws, rules and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules or regulations, to address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a negative impact on the Company’s customers and business. For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly increase costs for GATX customers who produce energy or manufacture chemical or other products that require significant amounts of energy to produce. This, in turn, could reduce customer demand to lease the Company’s assets.  New government regulations could also increase marine and other operating costs for GATX or its joint venture entities, or could require significant capital expenditures to comply. All or any of these potential consequences of climate change could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows. A small number of shareholders could significantly influence GATX’s business and affairs.  Based on filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and other information available to the Company, seven shareholders collectively controlled approximately 50% of GATX’s outstanding common stock.  Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect matters that require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.    16GATX cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or deflation will have on its financial results.Effects of inflation are unpredictable as to timing and duration and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail, marine and other equipment has historically benefited GATX’s financial results. However, these benefits may be offset, in whole or in part, by increases in the costs for goods and services purchased by GATX, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, and maintenance and repair services and materials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in GATX’s cost of goods and services could adversely impact the Company’s financial performance. A period of prolonged deflation would have a negative impact on GATX from several perspectives, including lease rate pricing, residual values and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset, in whole or in part, by decreases in the cost to GATX of goods and services, including those discussed herein.Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact normal business operations, which could result in increased costs and decreases in revenues.The success of GATX’s ASC subsidiary is dependent upon its ability to operate efficiently on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, including, but not limited to, high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions in certain harbors or canals may restrict the volume that may be transported in ASC’s vessels on a per trip basis. These conditions could negatively impact GATX’s results of operations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.  Many of GATX’s employees are represented by unions, and the failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages or substantially higher labor costs.A significant portion of GATX’s employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, including wages, health and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues. Historically, the Company and its unions have been generally successful in negotiating acceptable agreements without the occurrence of material work stoppages. However, if the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable new agreements, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, lockouts by the Company, or other forms of business disruption and increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers, any of which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Changes to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect GATX’s results of operations.GATX’s pension and other post-retirement costs are dependent on various assumptions used to calculate such amounts, including discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates and other factors.  Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect GATX’s financial position and results of operations.  Periods of low interest rates reduce the discount rate used to calculate GATX's funding obligations, which may increase GATX's funding requirements.  Additionally, GATX could be required to increase contributions to its pension plans as a result of changes to laws, regulations or rules that increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If GATX were forced to increase contributions to its pension plans, the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.  GATX’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries.GATX is subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As a result, GATX’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates, legislative changes impacting statutory tax rates, including the impact on recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or by material audit assessments.United States and global economic and political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war, could adversely affect GATX.National and international political developments, instability and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terrorist attacks, could result in global economic weakness in the United States and in other countries where GATX operates, and could have an adverse impact on GATX. The effects may include: legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of railcars and marine  17vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of railcars and marine vessels; a decrease in demand for rail and marine services; lower utilization of new and existing rail and marine equipment; lower rail lease and marine charter rates; impairments of rail and marine assets or capital market disruption, which may raise GATX’s financing costs or limit its access to capital; and liability or losses resulting from acts of terrorism involving GATX’s assets. Depending upon the severity, scope and duration of these effects, the impact on GATX’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be material. GATX’s business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. GATX relies on its information technology (“IT”) infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronic information critical for the efficient operation of its business and day-to-day operations. All IT systems are potentially vulnerable to security threats, including hacking, viruses and other malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt or gain access to such systems.  Breaches in GATX’s IT infrastructure could lead to a material disruption in its business, including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or other business information, and may have a material adverse effect on GATX’s operations, financial position and results of operations. GATX’s internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.If GATX fails to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, the Company may not be able to ensure that GATX can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations. Although GATX’s management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of error. As a result, the risk exists that GATX’s internal control may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements"
1,GATX,GATX CORP,2012-02-24,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
   GATX is subject to a number of risks that investors should consider before investing in GATXs securities. These risks include the factors described below as well as other information contained inthis filing and GATXs other filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of the events described below were to occur, GATXs business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects couldsuffer.  Competition could result in decreased profitability. GATX operates in a highly competitive business environment. In many cases, competitors are larger entities that have greater financialresources, higher credit ratings and a lower cost of capital than GATX. These factors may enable competitors to offer leases and loans to customers at lower rates than GATX is able to provide, thus impacting GATXs asset utilization orGATXs ability to lease assets on a profitable basis.  Weak economic conditions, financial market volatility and other factors maydecrease customer demand for GATXs assets and services and negatively impact GATXs business and results of operations.  GATX relies upon continued demand from its customers to lease its railcars, locomotives, marine assets and other equipment. Demand for these assets is dependent upon the markets for the products andservices offered by the Companys customers and the strength and growth of their businesses. A number of GATXs customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, chemical and construction industries, which are susceptible tomacroeconomic downturns in the United States and abroad and may experience significant changes in demand over time.  Weakeconomic conditions in the United States and other parts of the world in recent years have reduced demand from certain GATX customers for the types of assets and services GATX provides. Continued weakness in certain sectors of the economy also maymake it more difficult for GATX to lease certain types of railcars that are returned either at the end of a lease term or as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default. In Europe, the ongoing sovereign debt crisis, the loss of value by the Euroand related effects on the European banking system   9 has contributed to growing instability in the European currency and credit markets. Further deterioration of European economic conditions or significant loss of value by the Euro could reducedemand for the Companys European rail assets.  In many cases, demand for GATXs assets is also dependent oncustomers desire to lease, rather than purchase assets. There are a number of items that factor into the customers decision to lease or purchase assets, such as tax and accounting considerations, interest rates and operationalflexibility. GATX has no control over these external considerations, and changes in these factors, including potential changes to lease accounting rules, could negatively impact demand for its assets held for lease. Additional factors influencing customer demand for GATXs assets include changes in production volumes, potential changes in supplychains, choices regarding type of transportation asset, availability of substitutes and other operational needs. Demand for the marine assets and shipping services provided by the Company and its marine joint ventures is also dependent upon thefactors discussed above. A significant decline in customer demand for the assets and services provided by GATX could adversely affect the Companys financial performance.  GATX may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates. GATXs profitability is largely dependent on its ability to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates and to re-lease or sellassets upon lease expiration. A number of factors can adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates, including, but not limited to, an economic downturn causing reduced demand, changes in customer behavior, excess capacity in themarketplace or other changes in supply or demand for such assets. Continued economic uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for GATXs assets could cause customers to demand shorter lease terms and lower lease rates and could result in adecrease in the utilization rate for GATXs assets and reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low lease rates for longer terms thereby resulting in an adverse impact on current or future revenues. GATXs access to newly-built railcars may be limited, and long-term railcar purchase commitments could subject GATX to material operationaland financial risks. Unlike certain of its competitors in the railcar leasing market, GATX does not manufacturerailcars. GATXs ability to acquire newly-built railcars could be limited if the Company is unable to procure railcars from manufacturers on competitive terms. In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly-built railcars on competitive terms, GATX from time to time enters into long-term supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significantnumbers of newly-built railcars over a multi-year period. The Companys purchase commitments under these long-term agreements generally are not subject to cancellation or material reduction by GATX. If economic conditions weaken during the termof a long-term supply agreement, GATX would be required to continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at times when it is difficult for the Company to place the railcars with customers and the Companys financing costs may beunattractively high.  GATXs rail and marine assets and operations are subject to various laws, rules and regulations, and failureto comply with, or changes to, these laws, rules or regulations could have a significant negative effect on GATXs business and profitability.  GATXs rail and marine operations are subject to various laws, rules and regulations administered by authorities in jurisdictions where GATX does business. In the United States, GATXs railcarfleet and operations are subject to rules and regulations relating to safety, operations, maintenance and mechanical standards promulgated by various federal and state agencies and industry organizations, including the U.S. Department ofTransportation, the Federal Railroad Administration and the Association of American Railroads. In addition, state agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety matters not otherwise preempted by federal law.GATXs business operations and its railcar fleet may be adversely impacted by rules and regulations promulgated by these governmental and industry agencies, which could require substantial modification, maintenance or refurbishment ofGATXs railcars or potentially make such railcars inoperable or obsolete. Violations of these rules and regulations can result in substantial fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets.  10 Similarly, GATXs marine assets and operations are subject to regulation by variousfederal and state agencies, including the Maritime Administration of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which establish rules and regulations relating to safety, citizenship,emissions, ballast discharges and other environmental and operational matters. If GATX fails to comply with these rules and regulations, the Company could be prohibited from operating or leasing marine assets in the U.S. market and, under certaincircumstances, could incur severe fines and penalties, including potential limitations on operations or forfeitures of assets. In addition, GATXs foreign operations are subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where the Company does business.Failure to comply with, or future changes to, any of the foregoing laws, rules or regulations could restrict the use or reduce the economic value of GATXs assets, including loss of revenue, or cause GATX to incur significant expenditures tocomply, thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to laws, rules and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules or regulations, could result in the obsolescence of various assets or impose compliance costs thatare so significant as to render such assets economically obsolete.  Deterioration of conditions in the global capital markets, weakeningof macroeconomic conditions, and negative changes in credit ratings may limit the ability of GATX to secure financing and may increase its borrowing costs.  GATX relies, in large part, upon banks and capital markets to fund its operations and contractual commitments, including the issuance of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. These markets canexperience high levels of volatility and access to capital can be constrained for an extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital markets, a number of other factors could cause GATX to incur increased borrowing costs and to havegreater difficulty accessing public and private markets for both secured and unsecured debt. These factors include GATXs financial performance and its credit ratings and rating outlook as determined primarily by rating agencies such asStandard & Poors and Moodys Investor Service. If GATX is unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, the Companys other sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations andportfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund its operations and contractual commitments.  GATXs assets may become obsolete. In addition to changes in laws, rules and regulations that may make assets obsolete, GATX may be adversely impacted bychanges in the preferred method used by the Companys customers to ship their products, changes in demand for particular products, or by a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than leasing them from GATX. The industries in whichGATXs customers operate are driven by dynamic market forces and trends, which are in turn influenced by economic and political factors in the United States and abroad. Demand for GATXs rail and marine assets may be significantly affectedby changes in the markets in which the Companys customers operate. A significant reduction in customer demand for transportation or manufacture of a particular product or change in the preferred method of transportation used by customers toship their products could result in the economic obsolescence of GATX assets leased by those customers.  Events or conditions negativelyaffecting certain assets, customers or geographic regions in which GATX has a large investment could have a negative impact on its results of operations.  GATXs revenues are generally derived from a number of different asset types, customers, industries and geographic locations. However, from time to time, GATX could have a large investment in aparticular asset type, a large revenue stream associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large number of customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a particular asset type,discrete events with a specific customer or industry, or adverse regional economic conditions, particularly for those assets, customers or regions in which GATX has a concentrated exposure, could have a negative impact on GATXs results ofoperations.   11 GATXs allowance for losses may prove inadequate. GATXs allowance for losses on reservable assets may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses in its portfolio if unexpectedadverse changes in the economy differ from the expectations of management or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality of GATXs customer base materially deteriorates, the Company maybe required to provide for additional credit losses and GATXs financial position or results of operations could be negatively impacted. GATX may incur future asset impairment charges.  GATX regularly reviews long-lived assets and joint venture investments for impairment, including when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not berecoverable. GATX may be required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of a weak economic environment, challenging market conditions, events related to particular customers or asset types, or as a result of asset orportfolio sale decisions by management or other factors that affect GATXs estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from its long-lived assets or joint venture investments.  GATX is subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs of remediation may be material.  GATXs operations are subject to extensive federal, foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials and remediation ofcontaminated sites. In addition, some of GATXs properties, including those previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial purposes whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Environmental liability canextend to previously owned or operated properties as well as properties currently owned and used by the Company. Environmental liabilities are routinely assessed, including obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites andassessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminants on its properties, the potential exists for environmental and remediation costs to bematerially different from the costs GATX has estimated.  GATX has been, and may in the future be, involved in various types oflitigation.  The nature of GATXs businesses and assets expose the Company to the potential for claims andlitigation related to personal injury and property damage, environmental claims and various other matters. Certain GATX railcars may be used by customers to transport hazardous materials, and a rupture of a railcar carrying such materials in anaccident could lead to litigation and subject GATX to the potential for significant liability. A substantial adverse judgment against GATX could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cashflows.  High energy prices could have a negative effect on the demand for GATXs products and services. Energy prices, including the price of natural gas and oil, are significant cost drivers for many of GATXs customers, either directlyin the form of raw material costs in industries such as the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the form of increased transportation costs. Sustained high energy prices could negatively impact these industries resulting in acorresponding adverse effect on customer demand for GATXs assets, as well as related services.  GATX may not be able to procureinsurance on a cost-effective basis.  GATX manages its exposure to risk, in part, by insuring its assets and theirassociated risks. There is no guarantee that such insurance will be consistently available on a cost-effective basis in the future. If the cost of insurance coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, GATX could be forced to reduce the amount ofcoverage and increase the amount of its self-insured risk retention.   12 The fair market value of GATXs long-lived assets may differ from the value of those assetsreflected in its financial statements.  GATXs assets primarily consist of long-lived assets such as railcars,marine vessels and industrial equipment. The carrying value of these assets in the financial statements may at times differ from their fair market value. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and may be material based on marketconditions and demand for certain assets.  Fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could have a negative impact onGATXs results of operations.  GATXs results are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as thefinancial results of certain subsidiaries are translated from their local currency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, the operating results of foreign subsidiaries, when translated, may differ materially from periodto period. GATX is also subject to gains and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in foreign exchangerates can have an effect on the demand and relative price for services provided by GATX domestically and internationally, and could have a negative impact on GATXs results of operations. GATX is also subject to risks associated withfluctuations in interest rates. The Company may seek to limit foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk through the use of currency or interest rate derivatives, but these measures may not be effective. A material and unexpected change ininterest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect GATXs financial performance.  GATX is subject to the inherentrisks of its joint venture investments.  GATXs investments include ownership interests in a number of jointventures managed and operated by third parties, many of whom may be smaller than GATX and lack the financial resources of GATX. The joint venture entities in which GATX invests are subject to many of the same risks discussed in this RiskFactors section, and GATX is indirectly exposed to these risks through its ownership interest in these joint ventures. Adverse developments in the business or financial results of these entities could have a negative impact on GATXsresults of operations. Additionally, where a joint venture is managed and operated by GATXs joint venture partner or another third party, GATX may not have control over all operational decisions, which may result in actions taken at the jointventure level that could have an adverse economic impact on GATX.  GATX has significant financial exposure related to the performance ofits aircraft engine leasing joint venture investments.  GATX and Rolls-Royce plc each own 50% of several joint venturesthat lease spare jet engines to owners and operators of commercial aircraft (collectively, the RRPF joint ventures). As of December 31, 2011, GATXs aggregate investment in these joint ventures was $179.6 million. Through its50% ownership of the RRPF joint ventures, GATX is exposed to various risks associated with the commercial aviation industry, including geographic exposure and customer concentrations unique to that industry. Further, the financial results of theRRPF joint ventures are heavily dependent on the performance of Rolls-Royce plc, which is both a major customer of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the joint ventures. Rolls-Royce plc leases a significant number of spare enginesfrom the joint ventures and also provides maintenance services on the engines leased by the RRPF joint ventures to Rolls-Royce plc and other customers of the joint ventures. The RRPF joint ventures are significant contributors to GATXsconsolidated segment profit. If the financial or operating performance of the RRPF joint ventures were to deteriorate, GATXs results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.GATX may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory responses to climate change. Changes in laws, rules and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules or regulations, to address greenhouse gasemissions and climate change could have a negative impact on the Companys customers and business. For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly increase costs for GATX customers who produce energy or manufacture chemical or otherproducts that require significant amounts of energy to produce. This, in turn, could reduce customer demand to lease the Companys assets. New government regulations could   13 also increase marine and other operating costs for GATX or its joint venture entities, or could require significant capital expenditures to comply. All or any of these potential consequences ofclimate change could have an adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  A smallnumber of shareholders could significantly influence GATXs business and affairs.  Based on filings with the U.S.Securities and Exchange Commission and other information available to the Company, seven shareholders collectively controlled approximately 50% of GATXs outstanding common stock. Accordingly, a small number of shareholders could affect mattersthat require shareholder approval, such as the election of directors and the approval of significant business transactions.  GATX cannotpredict with certainty the impact that inflation or deflation will have on its financial results.  Effects of inflationare unpredictable as to timing and duration and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail, marine and other equipment has historically benefited GATXs financialresults. However, these benefits may be offset, in whole or in part, by increases in the costs for goods and services purchased by GATX, including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies, utilities, and maintenance and repair services andmaterials, as well as increased financing costs. Significant increases in GATXs cost of goods and services could adversely impact the Companys financial performance. A period of prolonged deflation would have a negative impact on GATXfrom several perspectives, including lease rate pricing, residual values and asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of deflation may be offset, in whole or in part, by decreases in the cost to GATX of goods and services, includingthose discussed herein.  Unfavorable conditions on the Great Lakes could impact normal business operations, which could result inincreased costs and decreases in revenues.  The success of GATXs ASC subsidiary is dependent upon its ability tooperate efficiently on the Great Lakes. Disruptions at the Sault St. Marie locks or severe weather conditions, including, but not limited to, high wind and ice formation, could cause significant business interruptions or shortened sailing seasons.Additionally, low water levels and vessel draft restrictions in certain harbors or canals may restrict the volume that may be transported in ASCs vessels on a per trip basis. These conditions could negatively impact GATXs results ofoperations through increased operating costs or decreased revenues.  Many of GATXs employees are represented by unions, and thefailure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages or substantially higher labor costs.  A significant portion of GATXs employees are represented by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements that cover a range of workplace matters, including wages, health and welfarebenefits, work rules and other issues. Historically, the Company and its unions have been generally successful in negotiating acceptable agreements without the occurrence of material work stoppages. However, if the Company is unable to negotiateacceptable new agreements, it could result in strikes by the affected workers, lockouts by the Company, or other forms of business disruption and increased operating costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers, any of which couldhave an adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows.  Changes to assumptions used tocalculate post-retirement costs, increases in funding requirements and investment losses in pension funds could adversely affect GATXs results of operations.  GATXs pension and other post-retirement costs are dependent on various assumptions used to calculate such amounts, including discount rates, long-term return on plan assets, salary increases, healthcare cost trend rates and other factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect GATXs financial position and results of operations. Additionally, GATX could be required to increase contributions to its pension plans as aresult of changes to laws, regulations or rules that increase funding requirements or to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If GATX were forced to increase contributions to its pension plans, the Companys financialposition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively affected.   14 GATXs effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in theU.S. and foreign countries.  GATX is subject to taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. As aresult, GATXs effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the United States and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates, legislative changes impacting statutory tax rates, including theimpact on recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or by material audit assessments.  United States and globaleconomic and political conditions, including acts or threats of terrorism or war, could adversely affect GATX. National and international political developments, instability and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of terroristattacks, could result in global economic weakness in general and in the United States in particular, and could have an adverse impact on GATX. The effects may include: legislation or regulatory action directed toward improving the security ofrailcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction or operation of railcars and marine vessels, a decrease in demand for rail and marine services, lower utilization of new and existing rail and marineequipment, lower rail lease and marine charter rates; impairments of rail and marine assets or capital market disruption, which may raise GATXs financing costs or limit its access to capital, and liability or losses resulting from acts ofterrorism involving GATXs assets. Depending upon the severity, scope and duration of these effects, the impact on GATXs financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be material. GATXs business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats, and related disruptions. GATX relies on its information technology (IT) infrastructure to process, transmit and store electronicinformation critical for the efficient operation of its business and day-to-day operations. All IT systems are potentially vulnerable to security threats, including hacking, viruses other malicious software, and other unlawful attempts to disrupt orgain access to such systems. Breaches in GATXs IT infrastructure could lead to a material disruption in its business, including the theft, destruction, loss, misappropriation or release of confidential data or other business information, andmay have a material adverse effect on GATXs operations, financial position and results of operations.  GATXs internalcontrol over financial accounting and reporting may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.  IfGATX fails to maintain adequate internal controls over financial accounting, the Company may not be able to ensure that GATX can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance withSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations. Although GATXs management has concluded that adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of internal control can provide absolute assurance that the financialstatements are accurate and free of error. As a result, the risk exists that GATXs internal control may not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.  "
7,GATX,GATX CORP,2011-02-23,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     GATX is subject to a number of risks that investors should    consider before investing in GATXs securities. These risks    include the factors described below as well as other information    contained in this filing and GATXs other filings with the    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If any of the    events described below were to occur, GATXs business,    financial condition, results of operations and future growth    prospects could suffer. Competition    could result in decreased profitability.     GATX operates in a highly competitive business environment. In    many cases, competitors are larger entities that have greater    financial resources, higher credit ratings and a lower cost of    capital than GATX. These factors may enable competitors to offer    leases and loans to customers at lower rates than GATX is able    to provide, thus impacting GATXs asset utilization or    GATXs ability to lease assets on a profitable basis. Weak    economic conditions, financial market volatility and other    factors may decrease customer demand for GATXs assets and    services and negatively impact GATXs business and results    of operations.     GATX relies upon continued demand from its customers to lease    its railcars, locomotives, industrial equipment and marine    assets. Demand for these assets is dependent upon the markets    for the products and services offered by the Companys    customers and the strength and growth of their businesses. A    number of GATXs customers operate    9Table of Contents    in cyclical markets, such as the steel, chemical and    construction industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic    downturns in the United States and abroad and may experience    significant changes in demand over time.     As a result of the weak economic conditions currently affecting    the economy of the United States and other parts of the world,    certain GATX customers have experienced declines in their    operating and financial performance, which have, in turn,    reduced demand for the assets and services GATX provides.    Continued weakness in certain sectors of the economy also may    make it more difficult for GATX to lease certain types of    railcars that are returned either at the end of a lease term or    as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.     In many cases, demand for GATXs assets is also dependent    on customers desire to lease, rather than purchase assets.    There are a number of items that factor into the customers    decision to lease or purchase assets, such as tax and accounting    considerations, interest rates and operational flexibility. GATX    has no control over these external considerations, and changes    in these factors, including potential changes to lease    accounting rules, could negatively impact demand for its assets    held for lease.     Additional factors influencing customer demand for GATXs    assets include changes in production volumes, potential changes    in supply chains, choices regarding type of transportation    asset, availability of substitutes and other operational needs.    Demand for the shipping services provided by the Companys    ASC segment is also dependent upon the factors discussed above.    A significant decline in customer demand for the assets and    services provided by GATX could adversely affect the    Companys financial performance. GATX    may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory    rates.     GATXs profitability is largely dependent on its ability to    maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates and to re-lease    or sell assets upon lease expiration. A number of factors can    adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates,    including, but not limited to, an economic downturn causing    reduced demand, changes in customer behavior, excess capacity in    the marketplace or other changes in supply or demand for such    assets. Continued economic uncertainty or a decline in customer    demand for GATXs assets could cause customers to demand    shorter lease terms and lower lease rates and could result in a    decrease in the utilization rate for GATXs assets and    reduced revenues. Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in    relatively low lease rates for longer terms thereby resulting in    an adverse impact on current or future revenues. GATXs    access to newly-built railcars may be limited, and any long-term    railcar purchase commitments could subject GATX to material    operational and financial risks.     Unlike certain of its competitors in the railcar leasing market,    GATX does not manufacture railcars. GATXs ability to    acquire newly-built railcars could be limited if the Company is    unable to procure railcars from manufacturers on competitive    terms.     In order to obtain committed access to a supply of newly-built    railcars on competitive terms, GATX may enter into long-term    supply agreements with manufacturers to purchase significant    numbers of newly-built railcars over a multi-year period. The    Companys purchase commitments under these long-term    agreements generally are not subject to cancellation or material    reduction by GATX. If economic conditions weaken during the term    of a long-term supply agreement, GATX may be required to    continue to accept delivery of, and pay for, new railcars at    times when it is difficult for the Company to place the railcars    with customers and the Companys financing costs may be    unattractively high. GATXs    allowance for possible losses may prove    inadequate.     GATXs allowance for possible losses on reservable assets    may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses in its    portfolio if unexpected adverse changes in the economy differ    from the expectations of management or if discrete events    adversely affect specific customers, industries or markets. If    the credit quality of GATXs customer base materially    deteriorates, the Companys allowance may be insufficient    to cover credit losses and GATXs financial position or    results of operations could be negatively impacted.    10Table of ContentsDeterioration    of conditions in the global capital markets, weakening of    macroeconomic conditions, and negative changes in credit ratings    may limit the ability of GATX to secure financing and may    increase its borrowing costs.     GATX relies, in part, upon banks and capital markets to fund its    operations and contractual commitments, including the issuance    of long-term debt instruments and commercial paper. In recent    years, these markets have exhibited unprecedented volatility and    access to capital, particularly in the unsecured debt markets,    was significantly constrained for some borrowers for an extended    period of time. In addition to conditions in the capital    markets, a number of other factors could cause GATX to incur    increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty    accessing public and private markets for both secured and    unsecured debt. These factors include GATXs financial    performance and its credit ratings and rating outlook as    determined primarily by rating agencies such as    Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor    Service. If GATX is unable to secure financing on acceptable    terms, the Companys other sources of funds, including    available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from operations and    portfolio proceeds, may not be adequate to fund its operations    and contractual commitments. Changes    in laws, rules or regulations, or actions by authorities under    existing laws, rules or regulations, could negatively affect    GATXs business and profitability.     GATXs rail and marine operations are subject to various    laws, rules and regulations administered by authorities in    jurisdictions where GATX and its subsidiaries do business. In    the United States, GATXs rail operations are subject to    regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the    U.S. Department of Transportation, and railcar operations    are also affected by regulations adopted by the Association of    American Railroads. These agencies establish rules and    regulations for the rail industry, including mechanical,    maintenance and safety standards. Similarly, ASCs    operations are subject to regulation by various federal and    state agencies, including the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S.    Environmental Protection Agency which establish rules and    regulations relating to emissions, ballast discharges and other    environmental and operational matters. State agencies regulate    some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and    safety matters not otherwise preempted by federal law. In    addition, operations of GATXs foreign subsidiaries are    subject to the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where    they do business. Future changes in any of these laws, rules and    regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws,    rules or regulations, could restrict the use or reduce the    economic value of GATXs assets, including loss of revenue,    or cause GATX to incur significant expenditures to comply,    thereby increasing operating expenses. Certain changes to laws,    rules and regulations, or actions by authorities under existing    laws, rules or regulations, could result in the obsolescence of    various assets or impose compliance costs that are so    significant as to render such assets economically obsolete. GATXs    assets may become obsolete.     In addition to changes in laws, rules and regulations that may    make assets obsolete, GATX may be adversely impacted by changes    in the preferred method used by the Companys customers to    ship their products, changes in demand for particular products,    or by a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than    leasing them from GATX. The industries in which GATXs    customers operate are driven by dynamic market forces and    trends, which are in turn influenced by economic and political    factors in the United States and abroad. Demand for GATXs    rail and marine assets may be significantly affected by changes    to the markets in which the Companys customers operate. A    significant reduction in customer demand for transportation or    manufacture of a particular product or change in the preferred    method of transportation used by customers to ship their    products could result in the economic obsolescence of GATX    assets leased by those customers. High    energy prices could have a negative effect on the demand for    GATXs products and services.     Energy prices, including the price of natural gas and oil, are    significant cost drivers for many of GATXs customers,    either directly in the form of raw material costs in industries    such as the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the    form of increased transportation costs. Sustained high energy    prices could negatively impact these industries resulting in a    corresponding adverse effect on customer demand for GATXs    assets, as well as related services.    11Table of ContentsEvents    or conditions negatively affecting certain assets, customers or    geographic regions in which GATX has a large investment could    have a negative impact on its results of    operations.     GATXs revenues are generally derived from a number of    different asset types, customers, industries and geographic    locations. However, from time to time, GATX could have a large    investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream    associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large    number of customers located in a particular geographic region.    Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a particular    asset type, discrete events with a specific customer or    industry, or adverse regional economic conditions, particularly    for those assets, customers or regions in which GATX has a    concentrated exposure, could have a negative impact on    GATXs results of operations. GATX    is subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs    of remediation may be material.     GATXs operations are subject to extensive federal,    foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations    concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous    materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition,    some of GATXs properties, including those previously owned    or leased, have been used for industrial purposes whose    activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property.    Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or    operated properties as well as properties currently owned and    used by the Company. Environmental liabilities are routinely    assessed, including obligations and commitments for remediation    of contaminated sites and assessments of ranges and    probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due    to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified    contaminants on its properties, the potential exists for    environmental and remediation costs to be materially different    from the costs GATX has estimated. GATX    has been, and may in the future be, involved in various types of    litigation.     The nature of GATXs businesses and assets expose the    Company to the potential for claims and litigation related to,    among other things, personal injury and property damage,    environmental claims and other matters. Certain GATX railcars    may be used by customers to transport hazardous materials, and a    rupture of a railcar carrying such materials in an accident    could lead to litigation and subject GATX to the potential for    significant liability. A substantial adverse judgment against    GATX could have a material adverse effect on the Companys    financial position, results of operations and cash flows. GATX    may not be able to procure insurance on a cost-effective    basis.     GATX manages its exposure to risk, in part, by insuring its    assets and their associated risks. There is no guarantee that    such insurance will be consistently available on a    cost-effective basis in the future. If the cost of insurance    coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, GATX could be forced    to reduce the amount of coverage and increase the amount of its    self-insured risk retention. The    fair market value of GATXs long-lived assets may differ    from the value of those assets reflected in its financial    statements.     GATXs assets consist primarily of long-lived assets such    as railcars, marine vessels and industrial equipment. The    carrying value of these assets in the financial statements may    at times differ from their fair market value. These valuation    differences may be positive or negative and may be material    based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. GATX    may incur future asset impairment charges.     GATX regularly reviews long-lived assets and joint venture    investments for impairment, including when events or changes in    circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or    investment may not be recoverable. GATX may be required to    recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of    a weak economic environment, challenging market conditions,    events related to particular customers or asset types, or as a    result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management or    other factors that affect GATXs estimates of expected cash    flows to be generated from its long-lived assets or joint    venture investments.    12Table of ContentsFluctuations    in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could have a    negative impact on GATXs results of    operations.     GATXs results are exposed to foreign exchange rate    fluctuations as the financial results of certain subsidiaries    are translated from their local currency into U.S. dollars    upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, the operating    results of foreign subsidiaries, when translated, may differ    materially from period to period. GATX is also subject to gains    and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary    based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the    transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in    foreign exchange rates can have an effect on the demand and    relative price for services provided by GATX domestically and    internationally, and could have a negative impact on GATXs    results of operations. GATX is also subject to risks associated    with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company may seek to    limit foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk through the    use of currency or interest rate derivatives, but these measures    may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in    interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect    GATXs financial performance. GATX    is subject to the inherent risks of its joint venture    investments.     GATXs investments include ownership interests in a number    of joint ventures managed and operated by third parties. These    entities are subject to many of the same risk factors discussed    in this Risk Factors
 section. GATX is indirectly exposed to    these risks through its ownership interest in these entities,    and adverse developments in the business or financial results of    those entities could have a negative impact on GATXs    results of operations. Additionally, in those instances where a    joint venture is managed and operated by GATXs joint    venture partner or another third party, GATX may not have    control over all operational decisions which may result in    actions taken at the joint venture level that could have an    adverse economic impact on GATX. GATX    has significant financial exposure related to the performance of    its aircraft engine leasing joint venture    investments.     GATX and Rolls-Royce plc each own 50% of several joint ventures    that lease spare jet engines to owners and operators of    commercial aircraft (collectively, the RRPF joint    ventures). As of December 31, 2010, GATXs    investment in these joint ventures was $156.1 million.    Through its 50% ownership of the RRPF joint ventures, GATX is    exposed to various risks associated with the commercial aviation    industry, including geographic exposure and customer    concentrations unique to that industry. Further, the financial    results of the RRPF joint ventures are heavily dependent on the    performance of Rolls-Royce plc, which is both a major customer    of, and a critical supplier of maintenance services to, the    joint ventures. Rolls-Royce plc leases a significant number of    spare engines from the joint ventures and also provides    maintenance services on the engines leased by the RRPF joint    ventures to Rolls-Royce plc and other customers of the joint    ventures. The RRPF joint ventures are significant contributors    to GATXs consolidated segment profit. If the financial or    operating performance of the RRPF joint ventures were to    deteriorate, GATXs results of operations and cash flows    could be negatively affected. GATX    may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory    responses to climate change.     Changes in laws, rules and regulations, or actions by    authorities under existing laws, rules or regulations, to    address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a    negative impact on the Companys customers and business.    For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly    increase costs for GATX customers who produce energy or    manufacture chemical or other products that require significant    amounts of energy to produce. This, in turn, could reduce    customer demand to lease the Companys assets. New    government regulations could also increase GATXs marine    and other operating costs or require significant capital    expenditures to comply. All or any of these potential    consequences of climate change could have an adverse effect on    the Companys financial position, results of operations and    cash flows. GATX    cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or    deflation will have on its financial results.     Effects of inflation are unpredictable as to timing and duration    and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation    in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail,    marine and other equipment has historically benefited    GATXs financial results. However, these benefits may be    offset, in whole or in part, by    13Table of Contents    increases in the costs for goods and services purchased by GATX,    including salaries and wages, health care costs, supplies,    utilities, and maintenance and repair services and materials.    Significant increases in GATXs cost of goods and services    could adversely impact the Companys financial performance.    A period of prolonged deflation would have a negative impact on    GATX from several perspectives, including lease rate pricing,    residual values and asset remarketing opportunities. These    negative impacts of deflation may be offset, in whole or in    part, by decreases in the cost to GATX of goods and services,    including those discussed herein. Unfavorable    conditions on the Great Lakes could impact normal business    operations, which could result in increased costs and decreases    in revenues.     The success of GATXs ASC business segment is dependent    upon its ability to operate efficiently on the Great Lakes.    Severe weather conditions, including, but not limited to, high    wind and ice formation, could cause significant business    interruptions or shortened sailing seasons. Additionally, low    water levels and vessel draft restrictions in certain harbors or    canals may restrict the volume that may be transported in    ASCs vessels on a per trip basis. These conditions could    negatively impact GATXs results of operations due to    increased operating costs or decreased revenues. Many    of GATXs employees are represented by unions, and the    failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining    agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages or    substantially higher labor costs.     A significant portion of GATXs employees are represented    by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements    that cover a range of workplace matters, including wages, health    and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues. Historically,    the Company and its unions have been successful in negotiating    acceptable agreements without the occurrence of material work    stoppages. However, if the Company is unable to negotiate    acceptable new agreements, it could result in strikes by the    affected workers, business disruptions and increased operating    costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers, any    of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys    financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Changes    to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs,    increases in funding requirements and investment losses in    pension funds could adversely affect GATXs results of    operations.     GATXs pension and other post-retirement costs are    dependent on various assumptions used to calculate such amounts,    including discount rates, long-term return on plan assets,    salary increases, health care cost trend rates and other    factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely    affect GATXs financial position and results of operations.    Additionally, GATX could be required to increase contributions    to its pension plans as a result of changes to laws, regulations    or rules that increase funding requirements or to compensate for    investment losses in pension plan assets. If GATX were forced to    increase contributions to its pension plans, the Companys    financial position, results of operations and cash flows could    be negatively affected. GATXs    effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the    mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries.     GATX is subject to taxes in the United States and various    foreign jurisdictions. As a result, GATXs effective tax    rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of    earnings in the United States and foreign countries with    differing statutory tax rates, legislative changes impacting    statutory tax rates, including the impact on recorded deferred    tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or by material    audit assessments. United    States and world economic and political conditions, including    acts or threats of terrorism or war, could adversely affect    GATX.     National and international political developments, instability    and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of    terrorist attacks, could result in global economic weakness in    general and in the United States in particular, and could have    an adverse impact on GATX. The effects may include: legislation    or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of    railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which    could affect the construction or operation of railcars and    marine vessels, a decrease in demand for rail and marine    services, lower utilization of new and    14Table of Contents    existing rail and marine equipment, lower rail lease and marine    charter rates; impairments of rail and marine assets or capital    market disruption, which may raise GATXs financing costs    or limit its access to capital, and liability or losses    resulting from acts of terrorism involving GATXs assets.    Depending upon the severity, scope and duration of these    effects, the impact on GATXs financial position, results    of operations and cash flows could be material. GATXs    internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not    detect all errors or omissions in the financial    statements.     If GATX fails to maintain adequate internal controls over    financial accounting, the Company may not be able to ensure that    GATX can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective    internal control over financial reporting in accordance with    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related    regulations. Although GATXs management has concluded that    adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of    internal control can provide absolute assurance that the    financial statements are accurate and free of error. As a    result, the risk exists that GATXs internal control may    not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements. "
18,GATX,GATX CORP,2010-02-25,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     GATX is subject to a number of risks which investors should    consider before investing in GATXs securities. These risks    include the factors described below as well as other information    contained in this filing and GATXs other filings with the    U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The risk factors    described below are not the only risks facing the Company, and    additional risks not presently known to GATX or risks currently    considered immaterial also may adversely affect GATX. Competition    could result in decreased profitability.     GATX operates in a highly competitive business environment. In    many cases, competitors are larger entities that have greater    financial resources, higher credit ratings and a lower cost of    capital than GATX. These factors may enable competitors to offer    leases and loans to customers at lower rates than GATX is able    to provide, thus impacting GATXs asset utilization or    GATXs ability to lease assets on a profitable basis. Weak    economic conditions, financial market volatility and other    factors may decrease customer demand for GATXs assets and    services and negatively impact GATXs business and results    of operations.     GATX relies upon continued demand from its customers to lease    its railcars, locomotives, industrial equipment and marine    assets. Demand for these assets is dependent upon the markets    for the products and services offered by    9Table of Contents    the Companys customers and the strength and growth of    their businesses. A number of GATXs customers operate in    cyclical markets, such as the steel, chemical and construction    industries, which are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in    the United States and abroad and may experience significant    changes in demand over time.     As a result of the weak economic conditions currently affecting    the economy of the United States and other parts of the world,    certain of GATXs customers have experienced declines in    their operating and financial performance, which have, in turn,    reduced demand for the assets and services GATX provides.    Continued weakness in certain sectors of the economy also may    make it more difficult for GATX to lease certain types of    railcars that are returned either at the end of a lease term or    as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.     In many cases, demand for GATXs assets is also dependent    on customers desire to lease, rather than purchase assets.    There are a number of items that factor into the customers    decision to lease or purchase assets, such as tax    considerations, interest rates, balance sheet considerations and    operational flexibility. GATX has no control over these external    considerations, and changes in these factors could negatively    impact demand for its assets held for lease.     Additional factors influencing customer demand for GATXs    assets include changes in production volumes, potential changes    in supply chains, choices regarding type of transportation    asset, availability of substitutes and other operational needs.    Demand for the shipping services provided by the Companys    ASC segment is also dependent upon the factors discussed above.    A significant decline in customer demand for the assets and    services provided by GATX could adversely affect the    Companys financial performance. GATX    may be unable to maintain assets on lease at satisfactory    rates.     GATXs profitability is largely dependent on its ability to    maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates and to re-lease    or sell assets upon lease expiration. A number of factors can    adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates,    including, but not limited to, an economic downturn causing    reduced demand, changes in customer behavior, or other changes    in supply or demand for such assets. Continued economic    uncertainty or a decline in customer demand for GATXs    assets could cause customers to demand shorter lease terms and    lower lease rates and could result in a decrease in the    utilization rate for GATXs assets and reduced revenues.    Alternatively, customers may seek to lock-in relatively low    lease rates for longer terms thereby resulting in an adverse    impact on current or future revenues. GATXs    allowance for possible losses may prove    inadequate.     GATXs allowance for possible losses on reservable assets    may not be adequate over time to cover credit losses in its    portfolio if unexpected adverse changes in the economy differ    from the expectations of management or if discrete events    adversely affect specific customers, industries or markets. If    the credit quality of GATXs customer base materially    deteriorates, the Companys allowance may be insufficient    to cover credit losses and GATXs financial position or    results of operations could be negatively impacted. Deterioration    of conditions in the global capital markets, further weakening    of macroeconomic conditions, and negative changes in credit    ratings may limit the ability of GATX to secure financing and    may increase its borrowing costs.     GATX relies, in part, upon banks and capital markets to fund its    operations and contractual commitments, including availability    under existing bank credit facilities and the issuance of    long-term debt instruments and commercial paper from time to    time. Since July 2007, these markets have exhibited    unprecedented volatility. As a result, credit margins on    corporate debt increased significantly during late 2008 and the    first half of 2009, and then declined significantly later in    2009. Access to capital, particularly in the unsecured debt    markets, was significantly constrained for some borrowers for an    extended period of time. In addition to conditions in the    capital markets, a number of other factors could cause GATX to    incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty    accessing public and private markets for both secured and    unsecured debt. These factors include GATXs financial    performance and its credit ratings and rating outlook as    determined primarily by rating agencies such as    Standard & Poors and Moodys Investor    Service. If GATX is unable to secure financing on acceptable    terms, the Companys    10Table of Contents    other sources of funds, including available cash, bank    facilities, cash flow from operations and portfolio proceeds,    may not be adequate to fund its operations and contractual    commitments. Changes    in laws, rules or regulations, or actions by authorities under    existing laws, rules or regulations, could negatively affect    GATXs business and profitability.     GATXs rail and marine operations are subject to various    laws, rules and regulations administered by authorities in    jurisdictions where GATX and its subsidiaries do business. In    the United States, GATXs businesses are subject to    regulation by various federal and state agencies, including the    U.S. Department of Transportation, and railcar operations    are also affected by regulations adopted by the Association of    American Railroads. These agencies establish rules and    regulations for the railcar industry, including mechanical,    maintenance and safety standards. State agencies regulate some    aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety    matters not otherwise preempted by federal law. Similarly,    operations of GATXs foreign subsidiaries are subject to    the jurisdiction of authorities in countries where they do    business. Future changes in these laws, rules and regulations,    or actions by authorities under existing laws, rules or    regulations, could restrict the use or reduce the economic value    of GATXs assets, including loss of revenue, or cause GATX    to incur significant expenditures to comply, thereby increasing    operating expenses. Certain changes to laws, rules and    regulations, or actions by authorities under existing laws,    rules or regulations, could result in the obsolescence of    various assets or impose compliance costs that are so    significant as to render such assets economically obsolete. GATXs    assets may become obsolete.     In addition to changes in laws, rules and regulations that may    make assets obsolete, GATX may be adversely impacted by changes    in the preferred method used by the Companys customers to    ship their products, changes in demand for particular products,    or by a shift by customers toward purchasing assets rather than    leasing them from GATX. The industries in which GATXs    customers operate are driven by dynamic market forces and    trends, which are in turn influenced by economic and political    factors in the United States and abroad. Demand for GATXs    rail and marine assets may be significantly affected by changes    to the markets in which the Companys customers operate. A    significant reduction in customer demand for transportation or    manufacture of a particular product or change in the preferred    method of transportation used by customers to ship their    products could result in the economic obsolescence of GATX    assets leased by those customers. High    energy prices could have a negative effect on the demand for    GATXs products and services.     Energy prices, including the price of natural gas and oil, are    significant cost drivers for many of GATXs customers,    either directly in the form of raw material costs in industries    such as the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the    form of increased transportation costs. Sustained high energy    prices could negatively impact these industries resulting in a    corresponding adverse effect on customer demand for GATXs    assets, as well as related services. Events    or conditions negatively affecting certain assets, customers or    geographic regions in which GATX has a large investment could    have a negative impact on its results of    operations.     GATXs revenues are generally derived from a number of    different asset types, customers, industries and geographic    locations. However, from time to time, GATX could have a large    investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream    associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large    number of customers located in a particular geographic region.    Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a particular    asset type, discrete events with a specific customer or    industry, or adverse regional economic conditions, particularly    for those assets, customers or regions in which GATX has a    concentrated exposure, could have a negative impact on    GATXs results of operations. GATX    is subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs    of remediation may be material.     GATXs operations are subject to extensive federal,    foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations    concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous    materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In    11Table of Contents    addition, some of GATXs properties, including those    previously owned or leased, have been used for industrial    purposes whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto    the property. Environmental liability can extend to previously    owned or operated properties as well as properties currently    owned and used by the Company. Environmental liabilities are    routinely assessed, including obligations and commitments for    remediation of contaminated sites and assessments of ranges and    probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due    to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified    contaminants on its properties, the potential exists for    environmental and remediation costs to be materially different    from the costs GATX has estimated. GATX    has been, and may in the future be, involved in various types of    litigation.     The nature of GATXs businesses and assets expose the    Company to the potential for claims and litigation related to,    among other things, personal injury and property damage,    environmental claims and other matters. Certain GATX railcars    may be used by customers to transport hazardous materials, and a    rupture of a railcar carrying such materials in an accident    could lead to litigation and subject GATX to the potential for    significant liability. A substantial adverse judgment against    GATX could have a material adverse effect on the Companys    financial position, results of operations and cash flows. GATX    may not be able to procure insurance on a cost-effective    basis.     GATX manages its exposure to risk, in part, by insuring its    assets and their associated risks. There is no guarantee that    such insurance will be consistently available on a    cost-effective basis in the future. If the cost of insurance    coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, GATX could be forced    to reduce the amount of coverage and increase the amount of its    self-insured risk retention. The    fair market value of GATXs long-lived assets may differ    from the value of those assets reflected in its financial    statements.     GATXs assets consist primarily of long-lived assets such    as railcars, marine vessels and industrial equipment. The    carrying value of these assets in the financial statements may    at times differ from their fair market value. These valuation    differences may be positive or negative and may be material    based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. GATX    may incur future asset impairment charges.     GATX regularly reviews long-lived assets and joint venture    investments for impairment, including when events or changes in    circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or    investment may not be recoverable. GATX may be required to    recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of    a weak economic environment, challenging market conditions,    events related to particular customers or asset types, or as a    result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management or    other factors that affect GATXs estimates of expected cash    flows to be generated from its long-lived assets or joint    venture investments. Fluctuations    in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could have a    negative impact on GATXs results of    operations.     GATXs results are exposed to foreign exchange rate    fluctuations as the financial results of certain subsidiaries    are translated from their local currency into U.S. dollars    upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, the operating    results of foreign subsidiaries, when translated, may differ    materially from period to period. GATX is also subject to gains    and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary    based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the    transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in    foreign exchange rates can have an effect on the demand and    relative price for services provided by GATX domestically and    internationally, and could have a negative impact on GATXs    results of operations. GATX is also subject to risks associated    with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company may seek to    limit foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk through the    use of currency or interest rate derivatives, but these measures    may not be effective. A material and unexpected change in    interest rates or foreign exchange rates could negatively affect    GATXs financial performance.    12Table of ContentsGATX    is subject to the inherent risks of its joint venture    investments.     GATXs investments include ownership interests in a number    of joint ventures managed and operated by third parties. These    entities are subject to many of the same risk factors discussed    in this Risk Factors
 section. GATX is indirectly exposed to    these risks through its ownership interest in these entities,    and adverse developments in the business or financial results of    those entities could have a negative impact on GATXs    results of operations. Additionally, in those instances where a    joint venture is managed and operated by GATXs joint    venture partner or another third party, GATX may not have    control over all operational decisions which may result in    actions taken at the joint venture level that could have an    adverse economic impact on GATX. GATX    may be affected by climate change or market or regulatory    responses to climate change.     Changes in laws, rules and regulations, or actions by    authorities under existing laws, rules or regulations, to    address greenhouse gas emissions and climate change could have a    negative impact on the Companys customers and business.    For example, restrictions on emissions could significantly    increase costs for GATX customers who produce energy or    manufacture chemical or other products that require significant    amounts of energy to produce. This, in turn, could reduce    customer demand to lease the Companys assets. New    government regulations could also increase GATXs marine    and other operating costs or require significant capital    expenditures to comply. All or any of these potential    consequences of climate change could have an adverse effect on    the Companys financial position, results of operations and    cash flows. GATX    cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or    deflation will have on its financial results.     Effects of inflation are unpredictable as to timing and duration    and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation    in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail,    marine and other equipment has historically benefited    GATXs financial results. However, these benefits may be    offset, in whole or in part, by increases in the costs for goods    and services purchased by GATX, including salaries and wages,    health care costs, supplies, utilities, and maintenance and    repair services and materials. Significant increases in    GATXs cost of goods and services could adversely impact    the Companys financial performance. A period of prolonged    deflation would have a negative impact on GATX from several    perspectives, including lease rate pricing, residual values and    asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of    deflation may be affected, in whole or in part, by decreases in    the cost to GATX of goods and services, including those    discussed herein. Unfavorable    conditions on the Great Lakes could disrupt normal business    operations, which could result in increased costs and decreases    in revenues.     The success of GATXs ASC business segment is dependent    upon its ability to operate efficiently on the Great Lakes.    Severe weather conditions, including, but not limited to, high    wind and ice formation, could cause significant business    interruptions. Additionally, low water levels may restrict the    volume that may be transported in ASCs vessels on a per    trip basis. These conditions could negatively impact GATXs    results of operations due to increased operating costs or    decreased revenues. Many    of GATXs employees are represented by unions, and the    failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining    agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages or    substantially higher labor costs.     A significant portion of GATXs employees are represented    by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements    that cover a range of workplace matters, including wages, health    and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues. Historically,    the Company and its unions have been successful in negotiating    acceptable agreements without the occurrence of any extended    work stoppages. However, if the Company is unable to negotiate    acceptable new agreements, it could result in strikes by the    affected workers, business disruptions and increased operating    costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers, any    of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys    financial position, results of operations or cash flows.    13Table of ContentsChanges    to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs,    increases in funding requirements and investment losses in    pension funds could adversely affect GATXs results of    operations.     GATXs pension and other post-retirement costs are    dependent on various assumptions used to calculate such amounts,    including discount rates, long-term return on plan assets,    salary increases, health care cost trend rates and other    factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely    affect GATXs financial position and results of operations.    Additionally, GATX could be required to increase contributions    to its pension plans as a result of changes to laws, regulations    or rules that increase funding requirements or to compensate for    investment losses in pension plan assets. If GATX were forced to    increase contributions to its pension plans, the Companys    financial position, results of operations and cash flows could    be negatively affected. GATXs    effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the    mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries.     GATX is subject to taxes in the United States and various    foreign jurisdictions. As a result, GATXs effective tax    rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of    earnings in the United States and foreign countries with    differing statutory tax rates, legislative changes impacting    statutory tax rates, including the impact on recorded deferred    tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or by material    audit assessments. United    States and world economic and political conditions, including    acts or threats of terrorism or war, could adversely affect    GATX.     National and international political developments, instability    and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of    terrorist attacks, could result in global economic weakness in    general and in the United States in particular, and could have    an adverse impact on GATX. The effects may include: legislation    or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of    railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which    could affect the construction or operation of railcars and    marine vessels, a decrease in demand for rail and marine    services, lower utilization of new and existing rail and marine    equipment, lower rail lease and marine charter rates;    impairments of rail and marine assets or capital market    disruption, which may raise GATXs financing costs or limit    its access to capital, and liability or losses resulting from    acts of terrorism involving GATXs assets. Depending upon    the severity, scope and duration of these effects, the impact on    GATXs financial position, results of operations and cash    flows could be material. GATXs    internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not    detect all errors or omissions in the financial    statements.     If GATX fails to maintain adequate internal controls over    financial accounting, the Company may not be able to ensure that    GATX can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective    internal control over financial reporting in accordance with    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related    regulations. Although GATXs management has concluded that    adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of    internal control can provide absolute assurance that the    financial statements are accurate and free of error. As a    result, the risk exists that GATXs internal control may    not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements. "
15,GATX,GATX CORP,2009-02-25,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     GATX is subject to a number of risks which investors should    consider before investing in GATXs securities. These risks    include the factors described below as well as other information    contained in this filing and GATXs other filings with the    Securities and Exchange Commission. The risk factors described    below are not the only risks facing the Company, and additional    risks not presently known to GATX or risks currently considered    immaterial also may adversely affect GATX.    9Table of ContentsCompetition    could result in decreased profitability.     GATX operates in a highly competitive business environment. In    many cases, competitors are larger entities that have greater    financial resources, higher credit ratings and a lower cost of    capital than GATX. Additionally, certain of GATXs    competitors have received loans from the U.S. government    under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) and    other similar programs, and it is possible that competitors may    deploy a portion of any TARP funds received to segments of their    operations that compete with GATX. These factors may enable    competitors to offer leases and loans to customers at lower    rates than GATX is able to provide, thus impacting GATXs    asset utilization or GATXs ability to lease assets on a    profitable basis. Weak    economic conditions, financial market volatility and other    factors may decrease customer demand for GATXs assets and    services and negatively impact GATXs business and results    of operations.     GATX relies upon continued demand from its customers to lease    its railcars and marine and industrial equipment assets. Demand    for these assets is dependent upon the markets for the products    and services offered by the Companys customers and the    strength and growth of their businesses. A number of GATXs    customers operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel,    chemical and construction industries, which are susceptible to    macroeconomic downturns in the United States and abroad and may    experience significant changes in demand over time.     As a result of the recessionary economic conditions currently    affecting the economy of the United States and other parts of    the world, GATXs customers may experience declines in    their operating and financial performance, which may, in turn,    reduce their demand for the assets and services GATX provides.    Additionally, disruptions in the global capital markets have led    to significantly decreased availability of credit and an    increase in borrowing costs. If GATXs customers are unable    to obtain credit to finance their operations, they may not be    able to pay, or may delay payment of, amounts owed to GATX,    which could have a material adverse effect on GATXs    results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.    Continued weakness in certain sectors of the economy also may    make it more difficult for GATX to lease certain types of    railcars that are returned either at the end of a lease term or    as a result of a customer bankruptcy or default.     In many cases, demand for GATXs assets is also dependent    on customers desire to lease, rather than purchase assets.    There are a number of items that factor into the customers    decision to lease or purchase assets, such as tax    considerations, interest rates, balance sheet considerations and    operational flexibility. GATX has no control over these external    considerations, and changes in these factors could negatively    impact demand for its assets held for lease.     Additional factors influencing customer demand for GATXs    assets include changes in production volumes, potential changes    in supply chains, choices regarding type of transportation    asset, availability of substitutes and other operational needs.    Demand for the shipping services provided by the Companys    ASC segment is also dependent upon the factors discussed above.    A significant decline in customer demand for the assets and    services provided by GATX could adversely affect the    Companys financial performance. GATXs    allowance for possible losses may prove    inadequate.     GATXs allowance for possible losses on reservable assets    may be not be adequate over time to cover credit losses in its    portfolio if unexpected adverse changes in the economy differ    from the expectations of management or if discrete events    adversely affect specific customers, industries or markets. If    the credit quality of GATXs customer base materially    deteriorates, the Companys allowance may be insufficient    to cover credit losses and GATXs financial position or    results of operations could be negatively impacted. Continued    deterioration in the global capital markets, weakening of    macroeconomic conditions, and changes in credit ratings may    limit the ability of GATX to secure financing and may increase    its borrowing costs.     GATX relies, in part, upon banks and capital markets to fund its    operations and contractual commitments, including availability    under existing bank credit facilities and the issuance of    long-term debt instruments and commercial paper from time to    time. Since July 2007, these markets have exhibited    unprecedented volatility. As a    10Table of Contents    result, interest rates on corporate debt have increased, and    access to capital, particularly in the unsecured debt markets,    has become significantly more constrained. In addition to the    capital markets environment, a number of other factors could    cause GATX to incur increased borrowing costs and to have    greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for both    secured and unsecured debt. These factors include GATXs    financial performance and its credit ratings and rating outlook    as determined primarily by rating agencies such as    Standard & Poors (S&P) and    Moodys Investor Service (Moodys). If    GATX is unable to secure financing on acceptable terms, the    Companys other sources of funds, including available cash,    bank facilities, cash flow from operations and portfolio    proceeds, may not be adequate to fund its operations and    contractual commitments. Changes    in laws, rules or regulations could negatively affect    GATXs business and profitability.     GATXs rail and marine operations are subject to various    laws, rules and regulations administered by a number of federal    and state agencies, including the U.S. Department of    Transportation. GATXs railcar operations are also affected    by regulations adopted by the Association of American Railroads.    These agencies establish rules and regulations for the railcar    industry, including mechanical, maintenance and safety    standards. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail    operations with respect to health and safety matters not    otherwise preempted by federal law. GATXs operations are    also subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies of    foreign countries. Future changes in these laws, rules and    regulations could reduce the economic value of GATXs    assets or require significant expenditures to comply thereby    increasing GATXs operating expenses. Certain changes to    laws, rules and regulations could mandate the obsolescence of    various assets or impose compliance costs that are so    significant as to render such assets economically obsolete. GATXs    assets may become obsolete.     In addition to changes in laws, rules and regulations that may    make assets obsolete, GATX may be adversely impacted by changes    in the preferred method used by the Companys customers to    ship their products or by a shift by customers toward purchasing    assets rather than leasing them from GATX. The industries in    which GATXs customers operate are driven by dynamic market    forces and trends, which are in turn influenced by economic and    political factors in the United States and abroad. Demand for    GATXs rail and marine assets may be significantly affected    by changes to the markets in which the Companys customers    operate. A significant reduction in customer demand or change in    the preferred method of transportation used by customers to ship    their products could result in the economic obsolescence of GATX    assets leased by those customers. High    energy prices could have a negative effect on the demand for    GATXs products and services.     Energy prices, including the price of natural gas and oil, are    significant cost drivers for many of GATXs customers,    either directly in the form of raw material costs in industries    such as the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the    form of increased transportation costs. Sustained high energy    prices could negatively impact these industries resulting in a    corresponding adverse effect on customer demand for GATXs    assets, as well as related services. Events    or conditions negatively affecting certain assets, customers or    geographic regions in which GATX has a large investment could    have a negative impact on its results of    operations.     GATXs revenues are generally derived from a number of    different asset types, customers, industries and geographic    locations. However, from time to time, GATX could have a large    investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream    associated with a particular customer or industry, or a large    number of customers located in a particular geographic region.    Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting a particular    asset type, discrete events with a specific customer or    industry, or adverse regional economic conditions, particularly    for those assets, customers or regions in which GATX has a    concentrated exposure, could have a negative impact on    GATXs results of operations.    11Table of ContentsGATX    is subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs    of remediation may be material.     GATXs operations are subject to extensive federal,    foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations    concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous    materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition,    some of GATXs properties, including those previously owned    or leased, have been used for industrial purposes whose    activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property.    Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or    operated properties as well as properties currently owned and    used by the Company. Environmental liabilities are routinely    assessed, including obligations and commitments for remediation    of contaminated sites and assessments of ranges and    probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due    to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified    contaminants on its properties, the potential exists for    environmental and remediation costs to be materially different    from the costs GATX has estimated. GATX    has been, and may in the future be, involved in various types of    litigation.     The nature of GATXs businesses and assets expose the    Company to the potential for claims and litigation related to,    among other things, personal injury and property damage,    environmental claims and other matters. Certain GATX railcars    may be used by customers to transport hazardous materials, and a    rupture of a railcar carrying such materials in an accident    could lead to litigation and subject GATX to the potential for    significant liability. A substantial adverse judgment against    GATX could have a material adverse effect on the Companys    consolidated financial condition, cash flows and results of    operations. GATX    may not be able to procure insurance on a cost-effective    basis.     GATX manages its exposure to risk, in part, by insuring its    assets and their associated risks. There is no guarantee that    such insurance will be consistently available on a    cost-effective basis in the future. If the cost of insurance    coverage becomes prohibitively expensive, GATX could be forced    to reduce the amount of coverage and increase the amount of its    self-insured risk retention. The    fair market value of GATXs long-lived assets may differ    from the value of those assets reflected in its financial    statements.     GATXs assets consist primarily of long-lived assets such    as railcars, marine vessels and industrial equipment. The    carrying value of these assets in the financial statements may    at times differ from their fair market value. These valuation    differences may be positive or negative and may be material    based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. GATX    may incur future asset impairment charges.     GATX regularly reviews long-lived assets and joint venture    investments for impairment, including when events or changes in    circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset or    investment may not be recoverable. GATX may be required to    recognize asset impairment charges in the future as a result of    a weak economic environment, challenging market conditions,    events related to particular customers or asset types, or as a    result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management or    other factors that affect GATXs estimates of expected cash    flows to be generated from its long-lived assets or joint    venture investments. Fluctuations    in foreign exchange rates and interest rates could have a    negative impact on GATXs results of    operations.     GATXs results are exposed to foreign exchange rate    fluctuations as the financial results of certain subsidiaries    are translated from their local currency into U.S. dollars    upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, the operating    results of foreign subsidiaries, when translated, may differ    materially from period to period. GATX is also subject to gains    and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary    based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the    transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in    foreign exchange rates can have an effect on the demand and    relative price for services provided by GATX domestically and    internationally, and could have a negative impact on GATXs    results of operations. GATX is also subject to risks associated    with fluctuations in interest rates. The Company may seek to    limit foreign exchange rate and interest rate risk through the    use of    12Table of Contents    currency or interest rate hedges, but these measures may not be    effective. A material and unexpected change in interest rates or    foreign exchange rates could negatively affect GATXs    financial performance. GATX    may be unable to maintain assets on lease or charter at    satisfactory rates.     GATXs profitability is largely dependent on its ability to    maintain assets on lease at satisfactory rates and to re-lease    or sell assets upon lease expiration. A number of factors can    adversely affect asset utilization rates and lease rates,    including, but not limited to, an economic downturn causing    reduced demand or oversupply in the markets in which GATX    operates, changes in customer behavior, or other changes in    supply or demand for such assets. A decline in customer demand    for GATXs assets could cause customers to demand shorter    lease terms and lower lease rates and could result in a decrease    in the utilization rate for GATXs assets and reduced    revenues. GATX    is subject to the inherent risks of its joint venture    investments.     GATXs investments include non-controlling interests in a    number of joint ventures managed and operated by third parties.    These entities are subject to many of the same risk factors    discussed in this Risk Factors
 section. GATX is indirectly    exposed to these risks through its ownership interest in these    entities, and adverse developments in the business or financial    results of those entities could have a negative impact on    GATXs results of operations. Additionally, in those    instances where a joint venture is managed and operated by    GATXs joint venture partner or another third party, GATX    may not have control over all operational decisions which may    result in actions taken at the joint venture level that could    have an adverse economic impact on GATX. GATX    cannot predict with certainty the impact that inflation or    deflation will have on its financial results.     Effects of inflation are unpredictable as to timing and duration    and depend on market conditions and economic factors. Inflation    in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values for rail,    marine and other equipment has historically benefited    GATXs financial results. However, these benefits may be    offset, in whole or in part, by increases in the costs for goods    and services purchased by GATX, including salaries and wages,    health care costs, supplies, utilities, and maintenance and    repair services and materials. Significant increases in    GATXs cost of goods and services could adversely impact    the companys financial performance. A period of prolonged    deflation would have a negative impact on GATX from several    perspectives, including lease rate pricing, residual values and    asset remarketing opportunities. These negative impacts of    deflation may be affected, in whole or in part, by decreases in    the cost to GATX of goods and services, including those    discussed herein. Unfavorable    conditions on the Great Lakes could disrupt normal business    operations, which could result in increased costs and decreases    in revenues.     The success of GATXs ASC business segment is dependent    upon its ability to operate efficiently on the Great Lakes.    Severe weather conditions and unanticipated ice formation could    cause significant business interruptions. Additionally, low    water levels may restrict the volume that may be transported in    ASCs vessels on a per trip basis. As a result, these    conditions could negatively impact results of operations due to    increased operating costs or decreased revenues. Many    of GATXs employees are represented by unions, and the    failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining    agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages or    substantially higher labor costs.     A significant portion of GATXs employees are represented    by labor unions and work under collective bargaining agreements    that cover a range of workplace matters, including wages, health    and welfare benefits, work rules and other issues. Historically,    the Company and its unions have been successful in negotiating    acceptable agreements without the occurrence of any extended    work stoppages. However, if the Company is unable to negotiate    acceptable new agreements, it could result in strikes by the    affected workers, business disruptions and increased operating    costs due to higher wages or benefits paid to union workers, any    of which could have an adverse effect on the Companys    consolidated financial condition, results of operations or    liquidity.    13Table of ContentsChanges    to assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs,    increases in funding requirements and investment losses in    pension funds could adversely affect GATXs results of    operations.     GATXs pension and other post-retirement costs are    dependent on various assumptions used to calculate such amounts,    including discount rates, long-term return on plan assets,    salary increases, health care cost trend rates and other    factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely    affect GATXs results of operations and financial    condition. Additionally, GATX could be required to increase    contributions to its pension plans as a result of changes to    laws, regulations or rules that increase funding requirements or    to compensate for investment losses in pension plan assets. If    GATX were forced to increase contributions to its pension plans,    the Companys results of operations, cash flows and    financial condition could be negatively affected. GATXs    effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the    mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries.     GATX is subject to taxes in the United States and various    foreign jurisdictions. As a result, GATXs effective tax    rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of    earnings in the United States and foreign countries with    differing statutory tax rates, legislative changes impacting    statutory tax rates, including the impact on recorded deferred    tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or by material    audit assessments. United    States and world economic and political conditions, including    acts or threats of terrorism or war, could adversely affect    GATX.     National and international political developments, instability    and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of    terrorist attacks, could result in global economic weakness in    general and in the United States in particular, and could have    an adverse impact on GATX. The effects may include: legislation    or regulatory action directed toward improving the security of    railcars and marine vessels against acts of terrorism, which    could affect the construction or operation of railcars and    marine vessels, a decrease in demand for rail and marine    services, lower utilization of new and existing rail and marine    equipment, lower rail lease and marine charter rates;    impairments of rail and marine assets or capital market    disruption, which may raise GATXs financing costs or limit    its access to capital, and liability or losses resulting from    acts of terrorism involving GATXs assets. Depending upon    the severity, scope and duration of these effects, the impact on    GATXs financial position, results of operations and cash    flows could be material. GATXs    internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not    detect all errors or omissions in the financial    statements.     If GATX fails to maintain the adequacy of internal control over    financial accounting, the Company may not be able to ensure that    GATX can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective    internal control over financial reporting in accordance with    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related    regulations. Although GATXs management has concluded that    adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of    internal control can provide absolute assurance that the    financial statements are accurate and free of error. As a    result, the risk exists that GATXs internal control may    not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements. "
5,GATX,GATX CORP,2008-02-29,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     GATX is subject to a number of risks which investors should    consider. Competition    could result in decreased profitability.     GATX operates in a highly competitive business environment. In    many cases, competitors are larger entities that have greater    financial resources, higher credit ratings and a lower cost of    capital than GATX. These factors may enable competitors to offer    leases and loans to customers at lower rates than GATX is able    to provide, thus impacting GATXs asset utilization or    GATXs ability to lease assets or make loans on a    profitable basis. GATX    depends upon continued demand from customers for its    assets.     GATX relies upon continued demand from its customers for its    assets. This demand depends upon the stability and growth of    customer operating requirements. A number of our customers    operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, chemical and    construction industries, and demand for our assets is tied to    cycles in those markets. Other factors influencing customer    operating requirements include changes in production volumes,    potential changes in supply chains, choices regarding type of    transportation asset, availability of substitutes, and other    operational needs.     In many cases, demand for GATXs assets is also dependent    on customers desire to lease, rather than purchase assets.    There are a number of items that factor into the customers    decision whether to lease or purchase assets, such as    8Table of Contents    tax considerations, interest rates, balance sheet considerations    and operational flexibility. GATX has no control over these    external considerations and changes in these factors could    negatively impact demand for its assets held for lease. GATX    cannot predict whether inflation will continue to have a    positive impact on its financial results.     Inflation in lease rates as well as inflation in residual values    for rail, marine and other equipment has historically benefited    GATXs financial results. Effects of inflation are    unpredictable as to timing and duration and depend on market    conditions and economic factors. GATXs    assets may become obsolete.     GATXs assets are subject to functional, regulatory or    economic obsolescence. Although GATX believes it is adept at    managing obsolescence risk, there is no guarantee that changes    in various market fundamentals or the adoption of new regulatory    requirements will not unexpectedly cause asset obsolescence in    the future. GATXs    allowance for possible losses may be inadequate to protect    against losses.     GATXs allowance for possible losses on gross receivables    may be inadequate if unexpected adverse changes in the economy    differ from the expectations of management, or if discrete    events adversely affect specific customers, industries or    markets. If the allowance for possible losses is insufficient to    cover losses related to gross receivables, then GATXs    financial position or results of operations could be negatively    impacted. The    fair market value of GATXs long-lived assets may differ    from the value of those assets reflected in its financial    statements.     GATXs assets consist primarily of long-lived assets such    as railcars, marine vessels and industrial equipment. The    carrying value of these assets in the financial statements may    at times differ from their fair market value. These valuation    differences may be positive or negative and may be material    based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. GATX    regularly reviews its long-lived assets for impairment. GATX    may incur future asset impairment charges.     An asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of    unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact    GATXs estimates of expected cash flows to be generated    from its long-lived assets or joint venture investments. GATX    regularly reviews long-lived assets and joint ventures for    impairment, including when events or changes in circumstances    indicate the carrying value of an asset or investment may not be    recoverable. GATX may be required to recognize asset impairment    charges in the future as a result of a weak economic    environment, challenging market conditions, events related to    particular customers or asset types, or as a result of asset or    portfolio sale decisions by management. GATX    may not be able to secure financing to fund its operations or    contractual commitments.     GATX is dependent, in part, upon the issuance of unsecured and    secured debt to fund its operations and contractual commitments.    A number of factors could cause GATX to incur increased    borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public    and private markets for both secured and unsecured debt. These    factors include the global capital market environment and    outlook, GATXs financial performance and GATXs    credit ratings and outlook as determined primarily by rating    agencies such as Standard & Poors    (S&P) and Moodys Investor Service    (Moodys). If GATX is unable to secure    financing on acceptable terms, GATXs other sources of    funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flow from    operations and portfolio proceeds may not provide adequate    liquidity to fund its operations and contractual commitments. GATX    may not be able to procure insurance on a cost-effective    basis.     The ability to insure its assets and their associated risks is    an important aspect of GATXs ability to manage risk. There    is no guarantee that such insurance will be consistently    available on a cost-effective basis in the future.    9Table of ContentsGATX    is subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs    of remediation may be material.     GATXs operations are subject to extensive federal,    foreign, state and local environmental laws and regulations    concerning, among other things, the discharge of hazardous    materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In addition,    some of GATXs properties, including those previously owned    or leased, have been used for industrial purposes whose    activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property.    Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or    operated properties as well as properties currently owned and    used by the Company. Environmental liabilities are routinely    assessed, including obligations and commitments for remediation    of contaminated sites and assessments of ranges and    probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties. Due    to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified    contaminants on its properties, the potential exists for    environmental and remediation costs to be materially different    from the costs GATX has estimated. GATX    has been, and may in the future be, involved in various types of    litigation.     The nature of assets which GATX owns exposes the Company to the    potential for various claims and litigation related to, among    other things, personal injury and property damage, environmental    claims and other matters. The transportation of certain    commodities by GATXs railcars and marine vessels,    particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose risks    resulting in potential liabilities and losses that could have a    significant effect on GATXs consolidated financial    condition or results of operations. High    energy prices could have a negative effect on the demand for    GATXs products and services.     Energy prices, including the price of natural gas and oil, are    significant cost drivers for many of our customers, either    directly in the form of raw material costs in industries such as    the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the form of    increased transportation cost. Sustained high energy prices    could negatively impact these industries resulting in a    corresponding adverse effect on the demand for GATXs    operating assets and assets held for lease, as well as related    services. New    regulatory rulings could negatively affect GATXs    profitability.     GATXs rail and marine operations are subject to the    jurisdiction of a number of federal agencies, including the    Department of Transportation. State agencies regulate some    aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety    matters not otherwise preempted by federal law. GATXs    operations are also subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory    agencies of foreign countries. New domestic or foreign    regulatory rulings may negatively impact GATXs financial    results through higher costs or reduced economic value of its    assets. Events    or conditions negatively affecting certain assets, customers or    geographic regions in which GATX has a large investment could    have a negative impact on its results of    operations.     GATXs revenues are generally derived from a number of    different asset types, customers, industries and geographic    locations. However, from time to time, GATX could have a large    investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream    associated with a particular customer, or a large number of    customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased    demand from a discrete event impacting a particular asset type,    discrete events with a specific customer or industry, or adverse    regional economic conditions, particularly for those assets,    customers or regions in which GATX has a concentrated exposure,    could have a negative impact on GATXs results of    operations. Fluctuations    in foreign exchange rates could have a negative impact on    GATXs results of operations.     GATXs results are exposed to foreign exchange rate    fluctuations as the financial results of certain subsidiaries    are translated from their local currency into U.S. dollars    upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, the operating    results of foreign subsidiaries, when translated, may differ    materially from period to period. GATX is also subject to gains    and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary    based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the    transactions and their settlement. In addition, fluctuations in    foreign exchange rates can have an effect on the demand and    relative price for services provided by GATX domestically and    internationally, and could have a negative impact on GATXs    results of operations.    10Table of ContentsGATX    may be unable to maintain assets on lease or charter at    satisfactory rates.     GATXs profitability is largely dependent on its ability to    maintain assets on lease (utilization) at satisfactory lease    rates or charter rates. A number of factors can adversely affect    utilization, lease and charter rates, including, but not limited    to: an economic downturn causing reduced demand or oversupply in    the markets in which GATX operates, changes in customer    behavior, or any other change in supply or demand caused by    factors discussed in this Risk section. GATX    is subject to the inherent risks of its joint venture    investments.     GATXs investments include noncontrolling interests in a    number of joint ventures managed and operated by third parties.    These entities are subject to many of the same risk factors    outlined herein. GATX is indirectly exposed to these risks    through its ownership interest in these entities and adverse    developments at the entity level could potentially have a    negative impact on GATXs results of operations.    Additionally, in those instances where the joint venture is    managed and operated by third parties, including affiliates of    partners, the Company may not have control over all operational    decisions which may result in actions taken at the entity level    that could potentially have an adverse economic impact on GATX. Unfavorable    conditions on the Great Lakes could disrupt normal business    operations, which could result in increased costs and decreases    in revenues.     The success of GATXs ASC business segment is dependent    upon its ability to operate efficiently on the Great Lakes.    Severe weather conditions and unanticipated ice formation could    cause significant business interruptions. Additionally, low    water levels may restrict the volume that may be transported in    ASCs vessels on a per trip basis. As a result, these    conditions could negatively impact results of operations due to    increased operating costs or decreased revenues. Many    of GATXs employees are represented by unions, and the    failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining    agreements may result in strikes, work stoppages or    substantially higher labor costs.     A significant portion of GATXs employees are    union-represented and work under collective bargaining    agreements with various labor organizations that cover a range    of worker matters, including wages, health and welfare benefits,    work rules and other issues. Historically, the Company and the    unions have been successful in negotiating acceptable agreements    without the incidence of any extended work stoppages. However,    if the Company is unable to negotiate acceptable new agreements,    it could result in strikes by the affected workers, business    disruptions and increased operating costs as a result of higher    wages or benefits paid to union workers, any of which could have    an adverse effect on the Companys consolidated financial    condition, results of operations or liquidity. Changes    in assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs could    adversely affect GATXs results of    operations.     GATXs pension and other post-retirement costs are    dependent on various assumptions used to calculate such amounts,    including discount rates, long-term return on plan assets,    salary increases, health care cost trend rates and other    factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely    affect GATXs results of operations and financial condition. GATXs    effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the    mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries.     GATX is subject to taxes in both the U.S. and various    foreign jurisdictions. As a result, GATXs effective tax    rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of    earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries with differing    statutory tax rates, legislative changes impacting statutory tax    rates, including the impact on recorded deferred tax assets and    liabilities, changes in tax laws or by material audit    assessments. United    States and world economic and political conditions, including    acts or threats of terrorism or war, could adversely affect    GATX.     National and international political developments, instability    and uncertainties, including political unrest and threats of    terrorist attacks, could result in global economic weakness in    general and in the United States in    11Table of Contents    particular, and could have an adverse impact on GATX. The    effects may include: legislation or regulatory action directed    toward improving the security of railcars and marine vessels    against acts of terrorism, which could affect the construction    or operation of railcars and marine vessels, a decrease in    demand for rail and marine services, lower utilization of new    and existing rail and marine equipment, lower rail lease and    marine charter rates; impairments of rail and marine assets or    capital market disruption, which may raise GATXs financing    costs or limit its access to capital, and liability or losses    resulting from acts of terrorism involving GATXs assets.    Depending upon the severity, scope and duration of these    effects, the impact on GATXs financial position, results    of operations and cash flows could be material. GATXs    internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not    detect all errors or omissions in the financial    statements.     If GATX fails to maintain the adequacy of internal control over    financial accounting, the Company may not be able to ensure that    GATX can conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective    internal control over financial reporting in accordance with    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related    regulations. Although GATXs management has concluded that    adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of    internal control can provide absolute assurance that the    financial statements are accurate and free of error. As a    result, the risk exists that GATXs internal control may    not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements. "

It is also possible that GATXs    other sources of funds, including available cash, bank    facilities, cash flow from operations and portfolio proceeds may    not provide adequate liquidity to fund its operations and    contractual commitments. United    States and world economic and political conditions, including    acts or threats of terrorism    and/or war,    could adversely affect GATX.     National and international political developments, instability    and uncertainties, including continuing political unrest and    threats of terrorist attacks, could result in global economic    weakness in general and in the United States in particular, and    could have an adverse impact on GATX. The effects may include:    legislation or regulatory action    6Table of Contents    directed toward improving the security of railcars and marine    vessels against acts of terrorism, which could affect the    construction    and/or    operation of railcars and marine vessels, a decrease in demand    for rail and marine services, lower utilization of new and    existing rail and marine equipment, lower rail lease and marine    charter rates; impairments of rail and marine assets or capital    market disruption, which may raise GATXs financing costs    or limit its access to capital, and liability or losses    resulting from acts of terrorism involving GATXs assets.    Depending upon the severity, scope and duration of these    effects, the impact on GATXs financial position, results    of operations and cash flows could be material. Competition    could result in decreased profitability.     GATX is subject to intense competition in its businesses. In    many cases, competitors are larger entities that have greater    financial resources, higher credit ratings and a lower cost of    capital than GATX. These factors may enable competitors to offer    leases and loans to customers at lower rates than GATX is able    to provide, thus impacting GATXs asset utilization or    GATXs ability to lease assets or make loans on a    profitable basis. GATX    depends upon continued demand from customers for its    assets.     GATX relies upon continued demand from its customers for its    assets. This demand depends upon the stability and growth of    customer operating requirements. A number of our customers    operate in cyclical markets, such as the steel, chemical and    construction industries, and demand for our assets is tied to    cycles in those markets. Other factors influencing customer    operating requirements include changes in production volumes,    potential changes in supply chains, choices regarding type of    transportation asset, availability of substitutes, and other    operational needs.     In many cases, demand for GATXs assets is also dependent    on customers desire to lease, rather than purchase assets.    There are a number of items that factor into the customers    decision whether to lease or purchase assets, such as tax    considerations, interest rates, balance sheet considerations and    operational flexibility. GATX has no control over these external    considerations and changes in these factors could negatively    impact demand for its assets held for lease. GATX    cannot predict whether inflation will continue to have a    positive impact on its financial results.     Inflation in leasing rates as well as inflation in residual    values for rail, marine and other equipment has historically    benefited GATXs financial results. Effects of inflation    are unpredictable as to timing and duration and depend on market    conditions and economic factors. GATXs    assets may become obsolete.     GATXs assets are subject to functional, regulatory or    economic obsolescence. Although GATX believes it is adept at    managing obsolescence risk, there is no guarantee that changes    in various market fundamentals or the adoption of new regulatory    requirements will not unexpectedly cause asset obsolescence in    the future. GATXs    allowance for possible losses may be inadequate to protect    against losses.     GATXs allowance for possible losses on gross receivables    may be inadequate if unexpected adverse changes in the economy    differ from the expectations of management, or if discrete    events adversely affect specific customers, industries or    markets. If the allowance for possible losses is insufficient to    cover losses related to gross receivables, then GATXs    financial position or results of operations could be negatively    impacted. The    fair market value of its long-lived assets may differ from the    value of those assets reflected in its financial    statements.     GATXs assets consist primarily of long-lived assets such    as railcars, marine vessels and industrial equipment. The    carrying value of these assets in the financial statements may    at times differ from their fair market value. These valuation    differences may be positive or negative and may be material    based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. GATX    regularly reviews its long-lived assets for impairment. GATX    may incur future asset impairment charges.     An asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of    unexpected adverse events or management decisions that impact    GATXs estimates of expected cash flows to be generated    from its long-lived assets or joint venture investments. GATX    regularly reviews long-lived assets and joint ventures for    impairment, including when    7Table of Contents    events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value    of an asset or investment may not be recoverable. GATX may be    required to recognize asset impairment charges in the future as    a result of a weak economic environment, challenging market    conditions, events related to particular customers or asset    types, or as a result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by    management. GATX    may not be able to procure insurance on a cost-effective    basis.     The ability to insure its assets and their associated risks is    an important aspect of GATXs ability to manage risk. There    is no guarantee that such insurance will be consistently    available on a cost-effective basis in the future. GATX    is subject to extensive environmental regulations and the costs    of remediation may be material.     GATX is subject to federal and state requirements for protection    of the environment, including those for discharge of    contaminated materials and remediation of contaminated sites.    Environmental exposure is routinely assessed, including    obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated    sites and assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries    from other responsible parties. Due to the regulatory    complexities and risk of unidentified contaminants on its    properties, the potential exists for environmental and    remediation costs to be materially different from the costs GATX    has estimated. GATX    has been, and may in the future be, involved in various types of    litigation.     The nature of assets which GATX owns exposes the Company to the    potential for various claims and litigation related to, among    other things, personal injury and property damage, environmental    claims and other matters. The transportation of certain    commodities by GATXs railcars and marine vessels,    particularly those classified as hazardous materials, pose risks    resulting in potential liabilities and losses that could have a    significant effect on GATXs consolidated financial    condition or results of operations. High    energy and commodity prices could have a negative effect on the    demand for GATXs products and services.     Energy prices, including the price of natural gas and oil, are    significant cost drivers for many of our customers, either    directly in the form of raw material costs in industries such as    the chemical and steel industries, or indirectly in the form of    increased transportation cost. Sustained high energy or    commodity prices could negatively impact these industries    resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on the demand for    GATXs operating assets and assets held for lease, as well    as related services. In addition, sustained high steel prices    could result in sustained high new railcar acquisition costs for    GATX. New    regulatory rulings could negatively affect GATXs    profitability.     GATXs rail and marine operations are subject to the    jurisdiction of a number of federal agencies, including the    Department of Transportation. State agencies regulate some    aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safety    matters not otherwise preempted by federal law. GATXs    operations are also subject to the jurisdiction of regulatory    agencies of foreign countries. New domestic or foreign    regulatory rulings may negatively impact GATXs financial    results through higher maintenance costs or reduced economic    value of its assets. Events    or conditions negatively affecting certain assets, customers or    geographic regions in which GATX has a large investment could    have a negative impact on its results of    operations.     GATXs revenues are generally derived from a number of    different asset types, customers, industries and geographic    locations. However, from time to time, GATX could have a large    investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream    associated with a particular customer, or a large number of    customers located in a particular geographic region. Decreased    demand from a discrete event impacting a particular asset type,    discrete events with a specific customer or industry, or adverse    regional economic conditions, particularly for those assets,    customers or regions in which GATX has a concentrated exposure,    could have a negative impact on GATXs results of    operations. Fluctuations    in foreign exchange rates could have a negative impact on    GATXs results of operations.     GATXs results are exposed to foreign exchange rate    fluctuations as the financial results of certain subsidiaries    are translated from their local currency into U.S. dollars    upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, the operating    8Table of Contents    results of foreign subsidiaries, when translated, may differ    materially from period to period. GATX is also subject to gains    and losses on foreign currency transactions, which could vary    based on fluctuations in exchange rates and the timing of the    transactions and their settlement.

These entities are subject to many of the same    risk factors outlined herein. GATX may be indirectly exposed to    these risks through its ownership interest in these entities,    and adverse developments at the entity level could potentially    have a negative impact on GATXs results of operations. Changes    in assumptions used to calculate post-retirement costs could    adversely affect GATXs results of    operations.     GATXs pension and other post-retirement costs are    dependent on various assumptions used to calculate such amounts,    including discount rates, long-term return on plan assets,    salary increases, health care cost trend rates and other    factors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely    affect GATXs results of operations and financial condition. GATXs    effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the    mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countries.     GATX is subject to taxes in both the U.S. and various foreign    jurisdictions. As a result, GATXs effective tax rate could    be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in the    U.S. and foreign countries with differing statutory tax rates,    legislative changes impacting statutory tax rates, including the    impact on recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes    in tax laws or by material audit assessments. GATXs    internal control over financial accounting and reporting may not    detect all errors or omissions in the financial    statements.     Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual    management assessments of the effectiveness of internal control    over financial reporting and a report by the Companys    independent auditors addressing these assessments. If GATX fails    to maintain the adequacy of internal control over financial    accounting, the Company may not be able to ensure that GATX can    conclude on an ongoing basis that it has effective internal    control over financial reporting in accordance with    Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related    regulations. Although GATXs management has concluded that    adequate internal control procedures are in place, no system of    internal control can provide absolute assurance that the    financial statements are accurate and free of error. As a    result, the risk exists that GATXs internal control may    not detect all errors or omissions in the financial statements.    9Table of Contents "

RISK FACTORS     GATX's businesses are subject to a number of risks which investors shouldconsider.GATX MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SECURE FINANCING TO FUND ITS OPERATIONS OR CONTRACTUALCOMMITMENTS.     GATX is dependent, in part, upon the issuance of unsecured and secured debtto fund its operations and contractual commitments. A number of factors couldcause GATX to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficultyaccessing public and private markets for both secured and unsecured debt. Thesefactors include the global capital market environment and outlook, GATX'sfinancial performance and GATX's credit ratings and outlook as determinedprimarily by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's (""S&P"") and Moody'sInvestor Service (""Moody's""). In addition, based on GATX's current creditratings, access to the commercial paper market and uncommitted money marketlines is uncertain and cannot be relied upon. It is also possible that GATX'sother sources of funds, including available cash, bank facilities, cash flowfrom operations and portfolio proceeds may not provide adequate liquidity tofund its operations and contractual commitments.UNITED STATES AND WORLD ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, INCLUDING ACTS ORTHREATS OF TERRORISM AND/OR WAR, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GATX'S BUSINESSES.     National and international political developments, instability anduncertainties, including continuing political unrest and threats of terroristattacks, could result in global economic weakness in general and in the UnitedStates in particular, and could have an adverse impact on GATX's businesses. Theeffects may include legislation or regulatory action directed toward improvingthe security of aircraft and railcars against acts of terrorism, which couldaffect the construction and/or operation of aircraft and railcars, a decrease indemand for air travel and rail services, consolidation and/or additionalbankruptcies in the airline industry; lower utilization of new and existingaircraft and rail equipment, lower rail and aircraft rental rates and impairmentof rail and air portfolio assets or capital market disruption, which may raiseGATX's financing costs or limit its access to capital, and liability or lossesresulting from acts of terrorism involving GATX's assets. Depending upon theseverity, scope and duration of these effects, the impact on GATX's financialposition, results of operations and cash flows could be material.COMPETITION COULD RESULT IN DECREASED PROFITABILITY IN GATX'S BUSINESSES.     GATX is subject to intense competition in its leasing and lendingbusinesses. In many cases, competitors are larger entities that have greaterfinancial resources, higher credit ratings and a lower cost of capital than                                        7GATX. These factors may enable competitors to offer leases and loans tocustomers at lower rates than GATX is able to provide, thus impacting GATX'sasset utilization or GATX's ability to lease assets or make loans on aprofitable basis.GATX'S CORE BUSINESSES DEPEND UPON ITS CUSTOMERS LEASING ASSETS.     GATX's core businesses rely upon its customers continuing to lease ratherthan purchase assets. There are a number of items that factor into thecustomer's decision to lease or purchase assets, such as tax considerations,interest rates, balance sheet considerations, and operational flexibility. GATXhas no control over these external considerations and changes in these factorscould negatively impact demand for its assets held for lease.GATX CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER INFLATION WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ONITS FINANCIAL RESULTS.     Inflation in leasing rates as well as inflation in residual values for air,rail and other equipment has historically benefited GATX's financial results.Effects of inflation are unpredictable as to timing and duration and depend onmarket conditions and economic factors.GATX'S ASSETS MAY BECOME OBSOLETE.     GATX's core assets may be subject to functional, regulatory, or economicobsolescence. Although GATX believes it is adept at managing obsolescence risk,there is no guarantee that changes in various market fundamentals or theadoption of new regulatory requirements will not unexpectedly cause assetobsolescence in the future.GATX'S ALLOWANCE FOR POSSIBLE LOSSES MAY BE INADEQUATE TO PROTECT AGAINSTLOSSES.     GATX's allowance for possible losses on gross receivables may be inadequateif unexpected adverse changes in the economy differ from the expectations ofmanagement, or if discrete events adversely affect specific customers,industries or markets. If the allowance for possible losses is insufficient tocover losses related to gross receivables, then GATX's financial position orresults of operations could be negatively impacted.THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS MAY DIFFER FROM THE VALUE OFTHOSE ASSETS REFLECTED IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.     GATX's assets consist primarily of long-lived assets such as railcars,aircraft, marine vessels and industrial equipment. The carrying value of theseassets in the financial statements may at times differ from their fair marketvalue. These valuation differences may be positive or negative and may bematerial based on market conditions and demand for certain assets. GATXregularly reviews its long-lived assets for impairment.GATX MAY INCUR FUTURE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.     An asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpectedadverse events or management decisions that impact GATX's estimates of expectedcash flows generated from its long-lived assets or joint ventures. GATXregularly reviews long-lived assets and joint ventures for impairment, includingwhen events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an assetmay not be recoverable. GATX may be required to recognize asset impairmentcharges in the future as a result of a weak economic environment, challengingmarket conditions, events related to particular customers or asset types, or asa result of asset or portfolio sale decisions by management.GATX MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROCURE INSURANCE ON A COST-EFFECTIVE BASIS IN THEFUTURE.     The ability to insure its rail and aircraft assets and their associatedrisks is an important aspect of GATX's ability to manage risk in these corebusinesses. There is no guarantee that such insurance will be available on acost-effective basis consistently in the future.                                        8GATX IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND ITS COSTS OFREMEDIATION MAY BE MATERIALLY GREATER THAN THE REMEDIATION COSTS IT HASESTIMATED.     GATX is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of theenvironment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials andremediation of contaminated sites. GATX routinely assesses its environmentalexposure, including obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminatedsites and assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from otherresponsible parties. Due to the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentifiedcontaminants on its properties, the potential exists for remediation costs to bematerially different from the costs GATX has estimated.GATX HAS BEEN, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE, INVOLVED IN VARIOUS TYPES OFLITIGATION.     The nature of assets which GATX owns and leases exposes the Company to thepotential for various claims and litigation related to, among other things,personal injury and property damage, environmental claims and other matters. Thetransportation of certain commodities by GATX's railcars, particularly thoseclassified as hazardous materials, pose risks resulting in potential liabilitiesand losses that could have a significant effect on GATX's consolidated financialcondition or results of operations.HIGH ENERGY PRICES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE DEMAND FOR GATX'SPRODUCTS AND SERVICES.     Energy prices, including the price of natural gas and oil, are significantcost drivers for many of our customers, particularly in the chemical and airlineindustries. Sustained high energy or commodity prices could negatively impactthese industries resulting in a corresponding adverse effect on the demand forGATX's assets held for lease and related services. In addition, sustained highsteel prices could result in higher new railcar acquisition costs.NEW REGULATORY RULINGS COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GATX'S PROFITABILITY.     GATX's air and rail operations are subject to the jurisdiction of a numberof federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation. State agenciesregulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health and safetymatters not otherwise preempted by federal law. GATX's operations are alsosubject to the jurisdiction of regulatory agencies of foreign countries. Newregulatory rulings may negatively impact GATX's financial results through highermaintenance costs or reduced economic value of its assets.EVENTS OR CONDITIONS NEGATIVELY AFFECTING CERTAIN ASSETS, CUSTOMERS ORGEOGRAPHIC REGIONS IN WHICH GATX HAS A LARGE INVESTMENT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVEIMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     GATX's revenues are generally derived from a wide range of asset types,customers and geographic locations. However, from time to time, GATX could havea large investment in a particular asset type, a large revenue stream associatedwith a particular customer, or a large number of customers located in aparticular geographic region. Decreased demand from a discrete event impacting aparticular asset type, discrete events with a specific customer, or adverseregional economic conditions, particularly for those assets, customers orregions in which GATX has a concentrated exposure, could have a negative impacton GATX's results of operations.FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GATX'SRESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     GATX's results are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as thefinancial results of certain subsidiaries are translated from their localcurrency into U.S. dollars upon consolidation. As exchange rates vary, theoperating results of their subsidiaries, when translated, may differ materiallyfrom period to period. GATX is also subject to gains and losses on foreigncurrency transactions, which could vary based on fluctuations in exchange ratesand the timing of the transactions and their settlement. In addition,fluctuations in foreign exchange rates can have an effect on the demand andrelative price for services provided by GATX domestically and internationally,and could have a negative impact on GATX's results of operations.                                        9GATX MAY BE UNABLE TO MAINTAIN ASSETS ON LEASE AT SATISFACTORY LEASE RATES.     GATX's profitability is largely dependent on its ability to maintain assetson lease (utilization) at satisfactory lease rates. A number of factors canadversely affect utilization and lease rates, including, but not limited to: aneconomic downturn causing reduced demand or oversupply in the markets in whichthe Company operates, changes in customer behavior, or any other change insupply or demand caused by factors discussed in this Risk section.CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS USED TO CALCULATE POST-RETIREMENT COSTS COULD ADVERSELYAFFECT GATX'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     GATX's pension and other post-retirement costs are dependent on variousassumptions used to calculate such amounts, including discount rates, long-termreturn on plan assets, salary increases, health care cost trend rates and otherfactors. Changes to any of these assumptions could adversely affect GATX'sresults of operations.GATX'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OFEARNINGS IN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES.     GATX is subject to taxes in both the U.S. and various foreignjurisdictions. As a result, GATX's effective tax rate could be adverselyaffected by changes in the mix of earnings in the U.S. and foreign countrieswith differing statutory tax rates, legislative changes impacting statutory taxrates, including the impact on recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities,changes in tax laws or by material audit assessments. In addition, deferred taxbalances reflect the benefit of net operating loss carryforwards, therealization of which will be dependent upon generating future taxable income.GATX'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING MAY NOT DETECTALL ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.     Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual managementassessments of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reportingand a report by the Company's independent auditors addressing these assessments.If GATX fails to maintain the adequacy of internal control over financialaccounting, the Company may not be able to ensure that GATX can conclude on anongoing basis that it has effective internal control over financial reporting inaccordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations.Although GATX's management has concluded that adequate internal controlprocedures are in place, no system of internal control can provide absoluteassurance that the financial statements are accurate and free of error. As aresult, the risk exists that GATX's internal control may not detect all errorsor omissions in the financial statements.                                        10"
