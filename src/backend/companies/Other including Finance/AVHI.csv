Youshould consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Form 10-K and our otherfilings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the followingevents occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the tradingprice of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment. For risk factors related to the Vaso BusinessCombination, please see the proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on Form S-4/A on February 14, 2024 (Registration No. 333-276422),as may be further amended from time to time. Risks Relating to our Searchfor, Consummation of, or Inability to Consummate, a Business Combination and Post-Business Combination Risks We may not be able to complete our initial BusinessCombination within the prescribed time frame, in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and wewould redeem our public shares and liquidate, in which case our public stockholders may only receive $10.15 per share (the amount originallydeposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering), or less than such amount in certain circumstances,and our warrants will expire worthless. OurFifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we must complete our initial Business Combination on or prior toJuly 19, 2024 (such amount of time assuming we continue to exercise our Monthly Extension Options as further described herein). We maynot be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial Business Combination within such time period. If we have not completedour initial Business Combination within such time period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii)as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than 10 business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payablein cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Accountand not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the numberof then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (includingthe right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possiblefollowing such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subjectin each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Insuch case, our public stockholders may only receive $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummationof our Initial Public Offering) and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receiveless than $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering)on the redemption of their shares. See “Risk Factors
 — If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in theTrust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.15 per share (the amountoriginally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering)” and other risk factors below. Wemay also propose additional amendments to our organizational and trust documents, including our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificateof Incorporation and Third Amended and Restated Investment Management Trust Agreement, to extend the time available for us to consummatea Business Combination. In such case, our stockholders would be required to approve such amendment and we would be obligated to offerto redeem our public shares in connection therewith. Our public stockholders may not be afforded anopportunity to vote on our proposed initial Business Combination, which means we may complete our initial Business Combination even thougha majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination. We may choose not to hold a stockholdervote to approve our initial Business Combination unless the initial Business Combination would require stockholder approval under applicablelaw or stock exchange listing requirements or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons. Except as requiredby law, the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed initial Business Combination or will allow stockholdersto sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors,such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval.Accordingly, we may complete our initial Business Combination even if holders of a majority of our public shares do not approve of theinitial Business Combination we complete. If we seek stockholder approval of our initialBusiness Combination, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their Founder Shares in favor of such initial Business Combination,regardless of how our public stockholders vote. Pursuant to a letter agreement,our Sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to vote their Founder Shares, as well as any Public Shares purchased since the InitialPublic Offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions), in favor of our initial Business Combination, whichwill increase the likelihood that we will receive the requisite stockholder approval for such initial Business Combination. We have alsoagreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial Business Combination without the prior consent of our Sponsor. 15  If we seek stockholder approval of our initialBusiness Combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, and if a stockholder or a “group”of stockholders are deemed to hold in excess of 15% of our public shares, such stockholder(s) will lose the ability to redeem all suchshares in excess of 15% of our public shares. If we seek stockholder approval ofour initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to thetender offer rules, our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with anyaffiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as definedunder Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15%of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” However,we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initialBusiness Combination. A stockholder’s inability to redeem the Excess Shares will reduce their influence over our ability to completeour initial Business Combination and such stockholder could suffer a material loss on their investment in us if they sell Excess Sharesin open market transactions. Additionally, a stockholder will not receive redemption distributions with respect to the Excess Shares ifwe complete our initial Business Combination. And as a result, any stockholder will continue to hold that number of shares exceeding 15%and, in order to dispose of such shares, would be required to sell their stock in open market transactions, potentially at a loss. Achari has been notified by Nasdaq that it is not in compliancewith certain standards which Nasdaq requires listed companies meet for their respective securities to continue to be listed and tradedon its exchange. If the Company is unable to regain compliance with such continued listing requirements, Nasdaq may choose to delist Achari’ssecurities from its exchange or may subject the Company to additional restrictions, which may adversely affect the liquidity and tradingprice of Achari’s securities. In addition, in connection with the Vaso Business Combination, Achari will be required to demonstratecompliance with Nasdaq’s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements,and there can be no guarantee that Achari will be able to satisfy such initial listing requirements in a timely manner or at all. The Company’s securities are currently listedon Nasdaq and it is anticipated that, following the Vaso Business Combination, Achari’s securities will continue to be listed onNasdaq. However, there can be no assurance that Achari’s securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq upon the closing of theVaso Business Combination, or maintain such listing prior to or subsequent to the closing of the Vaso Business Combination. In order to maintain the listing of Achari’ssecurities on Nasdaq prior and subsequent to the closing of the Vaso Business Combination, Achari must maintain certain financial, distribution,liquidity and stock price levels to satisfy Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements. Achari must, among other things, maintain aminimum bid price of $1.00 per share, a minimum amount of stockholders’ equity (generally $2,500,000) and a minimum number of holdersof its securities (generally 300 public holders). The foregoing is a brief description of the Nasdaq continued listing requirements applicableto Achari’s securities, and more detailed information about such requirements is set forth in Nasdaq Rule 5550. Achari has previously been notified by Nasdaq thatit is not in compliance with certain of Nasdaq’s continued listing requirements. As of the date hereof, Achari has regained compliancewith all such applicable listing requirements, except for Listing Rules 5450(b)(2)(A) and 5450(a)(2), with respect to which it has beengranted an extension by Nasdaq until April 2, 2024 to cure such existing continued listing requirement deficiencies. The following isa brief summary of such continued listing requirement deficiencies Nasdaq has notified the Company of and current status: ●Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B). On January 22, 2023,Achari received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that Achari was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B), requiring at least1,100,000 “Publicly Held Shares.” The letter stated that Achari had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance.Achari submitted a plan on March 9, 2023, and after review, on March 30, 2023, Nasdaq granted Achari an extension to regaincompliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B), until July 21, 2023. On June 22, 2023, Achari received a letter from Nasdaq indicatingthat Achari was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B). On July 21, 2023, Achari filed a Form 8-K with the SEC disclosing,among other things, certain details regarding Achari’s beneficial ownership and outstanding common stock. On August 7, 2023,Achari received a written notification from Nasdaq indicating that Achari had regained compliance under Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B), andaccordingly, that such matter was closed. On December 18, 2023, Achari received a separate letter from Nasdaq indicating that Achariwas not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(B), requiring at least 1,100,000 “Publicly Held Shares.” The letter statedthat Achari had 45 calendar days to submit a plan to regain compliance. However, after discussion between Nasdaq and the Company withrespect to the deficiency cited in such letter, Nasdaq notified the Company that there was not an existing violation of Listing Rule5450(b)(2)(B) with respect to the Company, and such letter was withdrawn. ●Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C). On February 24, 2023,Achari received a letter from Nasdaq indicating that Achari was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C), requiring a “MarketValue” of “Publicly Held Shares” of at least $15 million. The letter stated that Achari had 180 calendar days to regaincompliance with Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C), or until August 23, 2023. On August 7, 2023, Achari received a written notificationfrom Nasdaq indicating that Achari had regained compliance under Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(C), and accordingly, that such matter was closed. 16  ●Listing Rule 5250(c)(1). On April 24, 2023, Acharireceived a letter from Nasdaq indicating that Achari was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), as a result of Achari’sdelay in filing its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. On April 25, 2023, Achari filed its Form 10-K for the yearended December 31, 2022 with the SEC. On April 25, 2023, Achari received a written notification from Nasdaq indicating thatAchari had regained compliance under Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), and accordingly, that such matter was closed. On May 23, 2023, Acharireceived a letter from Nasdaq indicating that Achari was not in compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), as a result of Achari’sdelay in filing its Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2023. On May 26, 2023, Achari filed its Form 10-Q for the periodended March 31, 2023 with the SEC. On June 1, 2023, Achari received a written notification from Nasdaq indicating that Acharihad regained compliance under Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), and accordingly, that such matter was closed. ●Listing Rules 5450(b)(2)(A) and 5450(a)(2).On March 23, 2023, Achari received a letter from Nasdaq notifying Achari that, for the 30 consecutive trading days prior to thedate of the letter, Achari’s common stock had traded at a value below the minimum $50,000,000 “Market Value of Listed Securities”(“MVLS”) requirement set forth in Listing Rule 5450(b)(2)(A). The letter stated that Achari had 180 calendar days, or untilSeptember 19, 2023, to regain compliance. On October 3, 2023, Achari had not regained compliance with the MVLS requirementbecause Achari’s MVLS was below the $50,000,000 minimum MVLS requirement for the proceeding 30 consecutive trading days and asa result received a delisting determination letter from Nasdaq. On October 9, 2023, Achari received an additional letter from theStaff stating that on September 3, 2023, Achari reported less than the 400 total shareholders required under Nasdaq Listing Rule5450(a)(2), and this matter served as an additional basis for delisting the Company’s securities. On December 7, 2023, Acharipresented a plan of compliance to the Nasdaq hearings panel and requested an extension to regain compliance. On December 19, 2023,Nasdaq notified Achari that it had granted an extension until April 2, 2024, to cure the existing continued listing deficiencies. In connection with Achari’s efforts to regaincompliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards, Achari has previously undertaken certain actions, including, for example,transferring Founder Shares held by the Sponsor to certain members of the Sponsor, in an effort to regain compliance with Listing Rule5450(b)(2)(B). The Company and our Sponsor may subsequently undertake certain additional actions, which may include, but may not be limitedto, further transfers of Founder Shares held by the Sponsor to individual members of the Sponsor, and certain other actions, in orderto attempt to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards. For the avoidance of doubt, all Founder Shares previouslytransferred by the Sponsor to certain members of the Sponsor as described above, and any Founder Shares which may be transferred in asimilar fashion in the future, shall remain subject to all applicable transfer restrictions and other limitations as Founder Shares whichcontinue to be held directly by the Sponsor, and no Founder Shares, whether held directly by the Sponsor or members of the Sponsor, orwhether held by any other party, shall be eligible to receive liquidating distributions from the Trust Account under any circumstances,including in the event that Achari fails to complete an initial Business Combination, nor shall such transfers (past or present) increasethe overall amount of Founder Shares issued or in circulation, or in any way affect Achari’s public stockholders existing percentageownership of Achari. As of the date hereof, 1,572,400 Founder Shares are held directly by the Sponsor and 927,600 Founder Shares are helddirectly by members of the Sponsor. In addition, in connection with the closing of the Vaso Business Combination,Achari will be required to demonstrate compliance with Nasdaq’s initial listing requirements, which are more rigorous than Nasdaq’scontinued listing requirements, and there can be no guarantee that Achari will be able to satisfy such initial listing requirements ina timely manner, or at all. For instance, our stock price would generally be required to be at least $4.00 per share, our stockholders’equity would generally be required to be at least $5.0 million, and we would be required to have a minimum of 300 round lot holders (withat least 50% of such round lot holders holding securities with a market value of at least $2,500) of our securities. We cannot assureyou that we will be able to meet Nasdaq’s initial listing requirements at the time of the closing of our initial Business Combination. Nasdaq may delist the Company’s securities from tradingon its exchange if we cannot cure the existing continued listing deficiencies by April 2, 2024, which could limit investors’ abilityto make transactions in the Company’s securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions. On December 19, 2023, Nasdaq notified theCompany that it had granted an extension, until April 2, 2024, to cure the Company’s existing continued listing deficiencies.We cannot assure you that we will be able to regain compliance with the Nasdaq continued listing requirements by April 2, 2024, or atall, or that the Company’s securities will continue to be listed on Nasdaq or any other listing exchange. If the Company is unable to satisfy Nasdaq’s initial listingrequirements in connection with the closing of the Vaso Business Combination, Nasdaq may also move to delist the Company’s securitiesfrom trading on its exchange. Such a delisting would likely have a negative effect on the price of the Company’s securities andmay impair your ability to sell or purchase the Company’s securities when you wish to do so. In addition, if Nasdaq delists the Company’ssecurities from its exchange, Vaso may terminate the Business Combination Agreement. If Vaso were to terminate the Business CombinationAgreement, the consummation of the Business Combination could not occur regardless of how you vote on the Proposals, and we would be forcedto find a new target for a business combination, or liquidate if we were unable to do so before the timeline set out in our Fifth Amendedand Restated Certificate of Incorporation. 17  If Nasdaq delists the Company’s securitiesfrom trading on its exchange and the Company is not able to list its securities on another national securities exchange, the Company’ssecurities may be quoted on an over-the-counter market. However, if this were to occur, the Company could face significant material adverseconsequences, including: ●a limited availability of market quotations for its securities; ●reduced liquidity for its securities; ●a determination that the Company’s common stock isa “penny stock”, which will require brokers trading in such common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly resultin a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for the Company’s securities; ●a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and ●a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtainadditional financing in the future. As a result, an investor would likely find it moredifficult to trade, or to obtain accurate price quotations for, the Company’s securities if our securities are de-listed from Nasdaq.Delisting would likely also reduce the visibility, liquidity and value of the Company’s securities, including as a result of reducedinstitutional investor interest in the Company, and may increase the volatility of the Company’s securities. Delisting could alsocause a loss of confidence of potential business combination partners, which could further harm our ability to consummate a business combination.Alternatively, the Company could take steps to wind down the Company if the Company’s securities are delisted from Nasdaq. The National Securities Markets Improvement Actof 1996, which is a federal statute, prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities, which are referredto as “covered securities”. Because our securities are listed on Nasdaq, our units, Public Shares and warrants are consideredcovered securities under such statute. Although states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities, this federal statutedoes allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud, and, if there is a finding of fraudulent activity, thenthe states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case. While we are not aware of a state having used thesepowers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies, other than the State of Idaho, certain state securitiesregulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers, or threaten to use these powers, to hinder the sale of securitiesof blank check companies in their respective states. Further, if we were no longer listed on Nasdaq, our securities would not be consideredcovered securities, and we may become subject to additional regulation in each state in which we offer our securities, including in connectionwith a business combination. 18  Our Sponsor paid an aggregate of $25,000 for theFounder Shares, or approximately $0.009 per Founder Share. As a result, our Sponsor, its affiliates and our management team stand to makea substantial profit even if an initial Business Combination subsequently declines in value or is unprofitable for our public stockholders,and may have an incentive to recommend such an initial Business Combination to our stockholders. As a result of the low acquisitioncost of our Founder Shares, our Sponsor, its affiliates and our management team could make a substantial profit even if we select andconsummate an initial Business Combination with an acquisition target that subsequently declines in value or is unprofitable for our publicstockholders. Thus, such parties may have more of an economic incentive for us to enter into an initial Business Combination with a riskier,weaker-performing or financially unstable business, or an entity lacking an established record of revenues or earnings, than would bethe case if such parties had paid the full offering price for their Founder Shares, or if such a fee were not potentially payable. Our Private Placement Warrants are being accountedfor as a warrant liability and were recorded at fair value upon issuance and any changes in fair value each period will be reported inearnings, which may have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities or may make it more difficult for us to consummate aninitial Business Combination. Following the consummation of theInitial Public Offering and the concurrent private placement of warrants, we have 7,133,333 Private Placement Warrants outstanding. Wehave accounted for these Private Placement Warrants as a warrant liability, which means that we recorded them at fair value upon issuanceand any changes in fair value each period are reported in earnings. The impact of changes in fair value on earnings may have an adverseeffect on the market price of our securities. In addition, potential targets may seek a business combination partner that does not havewarrants that are accounted for as a warrant liability, which may make it more difficult for us to consummate an initial Business Combinationwith a target business. A stockholder’s only opportunity to affect theinvestment decision regarding a potential Business Combination will be limited to the exercise of their right to redeem their shares fromus for cash, unless we seek stockholder approval of the initial Business Combination. At the time of a stockholder’sinitial investment in us, they will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of a potential initialBusiness Combination. Since our board of directors may complete an initial Business Combination without seeking stockholder approval,public stockholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on a potential initial Business Combination, unless we seek such stockholdervote. Accordingly, if we do not seek stockholderapproval, a stockholder’s only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential Business Combination may be limitedto exercising their redemption rights within the period of time (which will be at least 20 business days) set forth in our tender offerdocuments mailed to our public stockholders in which we describe our initial Business Combination. The ability of our public stockholders to redeem theirshares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential Business Combination targets, which may make it difficult forus to enter into an initial Business Combination with a target. We may seek to enter into an initialbusiness combination agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certainamount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights, we would not be able to meet such closing conditionand, as a result, would not be able to proceed with the initial Business Combination. Prospective targets will be aware of these risksand, thus, may be reluctant to enter into an initial Business Combination with us. 19  The ability of our public stockholdersto exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable initial BusinessCombination or optimize our capital structure. At the time we enter into an agreementfor our initial Business Combination, we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, and we therefore willneed to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption. If our initialBusiness Combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires usto have a minimum amount of cash at closing, we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to meet such requirements,or arrange for third party financing. In addition, if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected,we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the Trust Account or arrange for third party financing.Raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirablelevels. The above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable initial Business Combination available to us oroptimize our capital structure. The amount of the deferred underwriting commissions payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC (“Chardan”),as representative of the several underwriters in our Initial Public Offering, will not be adjusted for any shares that are redeemed inconnection with an initial Business Combination. The per-share amount we will distribute to stockholders who properly exercise their redemptionrights will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commission and after such redemptions, the per-share value of shares held by non-redeemingstockholders will reflect our obligation to pay the deferred underwriting commissions. The ability of our publicstockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initialBusiness Combination would be unsuccessful and that a stockholder would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem their stock. If our initial business combinationagreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the Trust Account to pay the purchase price, or requires us to have a minimum amountof cash at closing, the probability that our initial Business Combination would be unsuccessful is increased. If our initial BusinessCombination is unsuccessful, a stockholder would not receive their pro rata portion of the Trust Account until we liquidate the TrustAccount. If a stockholder is in need of immediate liquidity, they could attempt to sell their stock in the open market; however, at suchtime our stock may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the Trust Account. In either situation, a stockholder may suffera material loss on their investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or thestockholder is able to sell their stock in the open market. The requirement that we complete our initialBusiness Combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating an initialBusiness Combination and may decrease our ability to conduct due diligence on potential Business Combination targets as we approach ourdissolution deadline, which could undermine our ability to complete our initial Business Combination on terms that would produce valuefor our stockholders. Any potential targetbusiness with which we enter into negotiations concerning an initial Business Combination will be aware that we must complete our initialBusiness Combination on or before July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not to continue to exercise our remaining MonthlyExtension Options). Consequently, such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating an initial Business Combination, knowingthat if we do not complete our initial Business Combination with that particular target business, we may be unable to complete our initialBusiness Combination with any target business. This risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above. In addition,we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial Business Combination on terms that we would have rejectedupon a more comprehensive investigation. See “Extension of Deadline to Consummate an Initial Business Combination”for more information. If we seek stockholder approval of our initial BusinessCombination, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares or warrants from public stockholders,which may influence a vote on a proposed initial Business Combination and reduce the public “float” of our public shares. If we seek stockholder approval ofour initial Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination pursuant to thetender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants or a combinationthereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial BusinessCombination, although they are under no obligation to do so. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engagein such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Accountwill be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. 20  Such a purchase may include acontractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereofand therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. In the event that our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliatespurchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights,such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. The purpose of such purchases couldbe to vote such shares in favor of the initial Business Combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approvalof the initial Business Combination, or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimumnet worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial Business Combination, where it appears that such requirement wouldotherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstandingor to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial Business Combination.Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial Business Combination that may not otherwise have beenpossible. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasersare subject to such reporting requirements. In addition, if such purchasesare made, the public “float” of our public shares or public warrants and the number of beneficial holders of our securitiesmay be reduced, possibly making it difficult to obtain or maintain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securitiesexchange. If a stockholder fails to receive notice of ouroffer to redeem our public shares in connection with our initial Business Combination, or fails to comply with the procedures for tenderingits shares, such shares may not be redeemed. We will comply with the tenderoffer rules or proxy rules, as applicable, when conducting redemptions in connection with our initial Business Combination. Despite ourcompliance with these rules, if a stockholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials, as applicable, such stockholder maynot become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares. In addition, proxy materials or tender offer documents, as applicable, thatwe will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial Business Combination will describe the various proceduresthat must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares. For example, we may require our public stockholders seekingto exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” to either tendertheir certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the tender offer documents mailed to such holders, or up to twobusiness days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the initial Business Combination in the event we distribute proxy materials,or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically. In the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these or any otherprocedures, its shares may not be redeemed. The on-going COVID-19 pandemic and other globalevents (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) and the corresponding impact on businesses and debt and equity markets could havea material adverse effect on our search for a Business Combination and any target business with which we ultimately consummate a BusinessCombination. The COVID-19 outbreak and otherglobal events (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) have resulted in, a widespread crisis that has adversely affected, and in thefuture could further, adversely affect economies and financial markets worldwide, and the business of any potential target business withwhich the Company consummates a Business Combination could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to completean initial Business Combination if concerns relating to COVID-19 or other matters of global concern (such as Russia’s invasion ofUkraine) continue to restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors, limit the ability to conduct due diligenceor limit the ability of a potential target company’s personnel, vendors and services providers to negotiate and consummate a transactionin a timely manner. The extent to which COVID-19 and other matters of global concern (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) impactour search for an initial Business Combination will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.The effect of the COVID-19 pandemic and other matters of global concern (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) on businesses, andthe inability to accurately predict the future impact of the pandemic and other global events on businesses, have also made determinationsand negotiations of valuation more difficult, which could make it more difficult to consummate a Business Combination transaction. Ifthe disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) continue, our abilityto consummate a Business Combination, or the operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate a Business Combination,may be materially adversely affected. In addition, our ability to consummate a transaction may be dependent on the ability to raise equityand debt financing which may be impacted by COVID-19 and other events, including as a result of increased market volatility, decreasedmarket liquidity and third-party financing being unavailable on terms acceptable to us or at all. Finally, the outbreak of COVID-19or other infectious diseases and other global events (such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine) may also have the effect of heighteningmany of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section, such as those related to the market for our securities. 21  Changes in the market for directors and officersliability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiate and complete an initial Business Combination. In recent months, the market fordirectors and officers liability insurance for special purpose acquisition companies has changed. Fewer insurance companies are offeringquotes for directors and officers liability coverage, the premiums charged for such policies have generally increased and the terms ofsuch policies have generally become less favorable. There can be no assurance that these trends will not continue. The increased cost and decreasedavailability of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance could make it more difficult and more expensive for us to negotiatean initial Business Combination. In order to obtain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance or modify its coverage asa result of becoming a public company, the post-Business Combination entity might need to incur greater expense, accept less favorableterms or both. However, any failure to obtain adequate directors’ and officers’ liability insurance could have an adverseimpact on the post-initial Business Combination entity’s ability to attract and retain qualified officers and directors. In addition, even after we were tocomplete an initial Business Combination, our directors and officers could still be subject to potential liability from claims arisingfrom conduct alleged to have occurred prior to the initial Business Combination. As a result, in order to protect our directors and officers,the post-Business Combination entity may need to purchase additional insurance with respect to any such claims (“run-off insurance”).The need for run-off insurance would be an added expense for the post-Business Combination entity and could interfere with or frustrateour ability to consummate an initial Business Combination on terms favorable to our investors. We may engage the underwriters of our InitialPublic Offering or their affiliates to provide additional services to us, which may include acting as financial advisor in connectionwith an initial Business Combination or as placement agent in connection with a related financing transaction. The underwriters of ourInitial Public Offering are entitled to receive deferred commissions that will be released from the Trust Account only upon completionof an initial Business Combination. These financial incentives may cause the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering to have potentialconflicts of interest in rendering any such additional services to us, including, for example, in connection with the sourcing and consummationof an initial Business Combination. We may engage the underwriters ofour Initial Public Offering or their affiliates to provide additional services including, for example, identifying potential targets,providing financial advisory services, acting as a placement agent in a private offering or arranging debt financing. We may pay the underwritersof our Initial Public Offering or their affiliates fair and reasonable fees or other compensation that would be determined at that timein an arm’s length negotiation. The underwriters of our Initial Public Offering are also entitled to receive deferred commissionsthat are conditioned on the completion of an initial Business Combination. The fact that the underwriters of our Initial Public Offeringor their affiliates’ financial interests are tied to the consummation of a Business Combination transaction may give rise to potentialconflicts of interest in providing any such additional services to us, including potential conflicts of interest in connection with thesourcing and consummation of an initial Business Combination. Stockholders do not have any rights or interests infunds from the Trust Account, except under certain limited circumstances. To liquidate their investment, therefore, a stockholder maybe forced to sell their public shares or warrants, potentially at a loss. Our public stockholders will beentitled to receive funds from the Trust Account only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial Business Combination,and then only in connection with those public shares that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations describedherein, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our Fifth Amended andRestated Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to offer redemption rights in connectionwith any proposed initial Business Combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public sharesif we do not complete our initial Business Combination on or prior to July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not tocontinue to exercise our remaining Monthly Extension Options) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initialBusiness Combination on or prior to July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not to continue to exercise our remainingMonthly Extension Options), subject to applicable law and as further described herein. Stockholders who do not exercise their redemptionrights in connection with an amendment to our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation would still be able to exercisetheir redemption rights in connection with a subsequent Business Combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder haveany right or interest of any kind in the Trust Account. Holders of warrants will not have any right to the proceeds held in the TrustAccount with respect to the warrants. Accordingly, to liquidate their investment, a stockholder may be forced to sell their public sharesor warrants, potentially at a loss. Stockholders are not entitled to protections normallyafforded to investors of many other blank check companies. Since the net proceeds of the InitialPublic Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial Business Combination witha target business that has not been identified, we may be deemed to be a “blank check” company under the United States securitieslaws. However, because we have net tangible assets in excess of $5,000,000 upon the successful completion of the Initial Public Offeringand the sale of the Private Placement Warrants and we filed a Current Report on Form 8-K, including an audited balance sheet demonstratingthis fact, we are exempt from rules promulgated by the SEC to protect investors in blank check companies, such as Rule 419. Accordingly,investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules. Among other things, this means our Units became immediatelytradable following our Initial Public Offering and we may have a longer period of time to complete our initial Business Combination thando companies subject to Rule 419. Moreover, if our Initial Public Offering had been subject to Rule 419, that rule would prohibit therelease of any interest earned on funds held in the Trust Account to us unless and until the funds in the Trust Account were releasedto us in connection with our completion of an initial Business Combination. 22  Because of our limited resourcesand the significant competition for business combination opportunities, it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial BusinessCombination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.15per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) on our redemptionof our public shares, or less than such amount in certain circumstances, and our warrants will expire worthless. We expect to encounter competitionfrom other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including private investors (which may be individuals or investment partnerships),other blank check companies and other entities competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire. Many of these individuals andentities are well-established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting, directly or indirectly, acquisitions of companiesoperating in or providing services to various industries. Many of these competitors possess similar technical, human and other resourcesto ours, and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. While we believethere are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale ofthe Private Placement Warrants, our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable willbe limited by our available financial resources. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisitionof certain target businesses. Furthermore, because we are obligated to pay cash for the public shares which our public stockholders redeemin connection with our initial Business Combination, target companies will be aware that this may reduce the resources available to usfor our initial Business Combination. This may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial BusinessCombination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.15per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) on the liquidationof our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.15per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) upon our liquidation.See “Risk Factors
— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reducedand the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in ourTrust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering)” and other risk factors below. As the number of special purpose acquisition companiesincreases, there may be more competition to find an attractive target for an initial Business Combination. This could increase the costsassociated with completing our initial Business Combination and may result in our inability to find a suitable target for our initialBusiness Combination. In recent years, the number of specialpurpose acquisition companies that have been formed has increased substantially. Many companies have entered into business combinationswith special purpose acquisition companies and there are still many special purpose acquisition companies seeking targets for their initialbusiness combination, as well as many additional special purpose acquisition companies currently in registration. As a result, at times,fewer attractive targets may be available, and it may require more time, effort and resources to identify a suitable target for our initialBusiness Combination. In addition, because there are morespecial purpose acquisition companies seeking to enter into an initial business combination with available targets, the competition foravailable targets with attractive fundamentals or business models may increase, which could cause target companies to demand improvedfinancial terms. Attractive deals could also become scarcer for other reasons, such as economic or industry sector downturns, geopoliticaltensions (including the recent outbreak of hostilities between Russia and Ukraine) or increases in the cost of additional capital neededto close business combinations or operate targets post-business combination. This could increase the cost of, delay or otherwise complicateor frustrate our ability to find a suitable target for and/or complete our initial Business Combination. If the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offeringand the sale of the Private Placement Warrants not being held in the Trust Account are insufficient to continue to fund our search foran initial Business Combination, it could limit the amount of time available to find a target business or businesses and complete ourinitial Business Combination and we will then depend on loans from our Sponsor or management team to fund our search for an initial BusinessCombination, to pay our taxes and to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unableto complete our initial Business Combination. The funds available to us to pursuean initial Business Combination are currently limited to the working capital held outside our Trust Account. If we are required to seekadditional capital, we would need to borrow funds from our Sponsor, management team or other third parties to operate or may be forcedto liquidate. None of our Sponsor, members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance fundsto us in such circumstances. Any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the Trust Account or from funds released tous upon completion of our initial Business Combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into private placement-equivalentwarrants at a price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. The $1,500,000 limit of conversion does not apply to notes issuedto our Sponsor in connection with the funding of an exercise of a Monthly Extension Option. Prior to the completion of our initial BusinessCombination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our Sponsor or an affiliate of our Sponsor as we do not believe thirdparties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our Trust Account.If we are unable to obtain these loans, we may be unable to complete our initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete ourinitial Business Combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us, we will be forced to cease operations and liquidatethe Trust Account. Consequently, our public stockholders may only receive approximately $10.15 per share (the amount originally depositedin our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) on our redemption of our public shares and our warrants willexpire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.15 per share (the amount originally depositedin our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) on the redemption of their shares. See “Risk Factors
—If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amountreceived by stockholders may be less than $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummationof our Initial Public Offering)” and other risk factors below. 23  Subsequent to the completion of our initial BusinessCombination, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significantnegative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our stock price, which could cause stockholders to lose some orall of their investment. Even if we conduct extensive due diligenceon a target business with which we combine, we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues that may be presentinside a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence,or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may beforced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result inour reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously knownrisks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items andnot have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptionsabout us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may besubject as a result of assuming pre-existing debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining debt financing to partiallyfinance the initial Business Combination. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the initial BusinessCombination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reductionin value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty ofcare or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxysolicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the initial Business Combination constituted an actionable materialmisstatement or omission. If third parties bring claims against us, theproceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.15per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering). Our placing of funds in the TrustAccount upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering may not protect those funds from third-party claims against us. Althoughwe will seek to have all vendors, service providers (except for our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective targetbusinesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of anykind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account for the benefit of our public stockholders, such parties may not execute such agreements,or even if they execute such agreements, they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the Trust Account, including, but notlimited to, fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceabilityof the waiver, in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the TrustAccount. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account, our managementwill perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executeda waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative.Withum Smith+Brown PC, our independent registered public accounting firm, the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering and Katten MuchinRosenman LLP, our legal counsel, have not executed agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the Trust Account. Examples of possibleinstances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultantwhose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants thatwould agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. Inaddition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, orarising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account for anyreason. Upon redemption of our public shares, if we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribedtimeframe, or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our initial Business Combination, we will be required toprovide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the 10 years followingredemption. Accordingly, the per-share redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the $10.15 per shareinitially held in the Trust Account, due to claims of such creditors. Pursuant to the letter agreement, our Sponsor has agreed thatit will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party for services rendered or products sold to us, or aprospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or similar agreement orbusiness combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the Trust Account to below the lesser of (i) $10.15 per share and (ii)the actual amount per share held in the Trust Account as of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account, if less than $10.15per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, less taxes payable, provided that such liability will not apply to anyclaims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the TrustAccount (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of ourInitial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked ourSponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our Sponsor has sufficient fundsto satisfy its indemnity obligations, and believe that our Sponsor’s only assets are securities of the company. Therefore, itis unlikely that our Sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully madeagainst the Trust Account, the funds available for our initial Business Combination and redemptions could be reduced to less than$10.15 per share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial Business Combination, and you would receive such lesseramount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us forclaims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses. 24  Our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnificationobligations of our Sponsor, resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distribution to our publicstockholders. In the event that the proceeds inthe Trust Account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.15 per share and (ii) the actual amount per share held in the Trust Accountas of the date of the liquidation of the Trust Account if less than $10.15 per share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets,in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes, and our Sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its obligationsor that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to takelegal action against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expectthat our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our Sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations tous, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment and subject to their fiduciary duties may choosenot to do so in any particular instance if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be toohigh relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. If our independentdirectors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations, the amount of funds in the Trust Account available for distributionto our public stockholders may be reduced below $10.15 per share. We may not have sufficient funds to satisfy indemnificationclaims of our directors and executive officers. We have agreed toindemnify our officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted by law. However, our officers and directors have agreed towaive (and any other persons who may become an officer or director prior to the initial Business Combination will also be requiredto waive) any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust Account and not to seek recourse againstthe Trust Account for any reason whatsoever. Accordingly, any indemnification provided will be able to be satisfied by us only if(i) we have sufficient funds outside of the Trust Account or (ii) we consummate an initial Business Combination. Our obligation toindemnify our officers and directors may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our officers or directors forbreach of their fiduciary duties. These provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigationagainst our officers and directors, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders. Furthermore, a stockholder’s investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damageawards against our officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions. If, after we distribute the proceeds in the TrustAccount to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is notdismissed, a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds, and we and our board may be exposed to claims of punitive damages. If, after we distribute the proceedsin the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed againstus that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcylaws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seekto recover all amounts received by our stockholders. In addition, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciaryduties to our creditors and/or having acted in bad faith, thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages, by paying publicstockholders from the Trust Account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. If, before distributing theproceeds in the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filedagainst us that is not dismissed, the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders andthe per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced. If, before distributing the proceedsin the Trust Account to our public stockholders, we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed againstus that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included inour bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent anybankruptcy claims deplete the Trust Account, the per-share amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection withour liquidation may be reduced. 25  Our stockholders may be held liable for claimsby third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares. Under the Delaware General CorporationLaw (the “DGCL”), stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributionsreceived by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemptionof our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination on or prior to July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicabledate if we opt not to continue to exercise our remaining Monthly Extension Options) may be considered a liquidating distribution underDelaware law. If a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makesreasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought againstthe corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting periodbefore any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distributionis limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and anyliability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. However, it is our intention to redeem ourpublic shares promptly following July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not to continue to exercise our remaining MonthlyExtension Options) in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with theforegoing procedures. Because we will not be complying withSection 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for ourpayment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the 10 years following our dissolution.However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations will be limited to searching for prospectivetarget businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) orprospective target businesses. If our plan of distribution complies with Section 281(b) of the DGCL, any liability of stockholders withrespect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributedto the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution. We cannotassure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us. As such, our stockholders could potentiallybe liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extendbeyond the third anniversary of such date. Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our Trust Account distributed to our public stockholdersupon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial Business Combination on or prior to July 19, 2024(or such earlier applicable date if we opt not to continue to exercise our remaining Monthly Extension Options), is not considered a liquidatingdistribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful (potentially due to the imposition of legalproceedings that a party may bring or due to other circumstances that are currently unknown), then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL,the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of threeyears, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. Because we are neither limited to evaluating a targetbusiness in a particular industry sector nor have we selected any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial BusinessCombination, you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target business’s operations. We are not limited to completingan initial Business Combination in any industry or geographical region, although we will not, under our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificateof Incorporation, be permitted to effectuate our initial Business Combination with another blank check company or similar company withnominal operations. Additionally, it may be difficult or impossible to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular targetbusiness’s operations, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition or prospects. To the extent we completeour initial Business Combination, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine. Notwithstandingthe foregoing, we will not invest in or consummate an initial Business Combination with a target business that we determine has been operating,or has plans to operate, in violation of U.S. federal laws, including the Controlled Substances Act. For example, if we combine witha financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings, we may be affected by the risks inherentin the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity. Although our officers and directors will endeavorto evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all ofthe significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outsideof our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business.We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securities will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment,if such opportunity were available, in a business combination target. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholdersfollowing our initial Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely tohave a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officersor directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securitieslaws that the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, relating to the initial Business Combination contained an actionablematerial misstatement or material omission. 26  Although we have identified general criteriaand guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses, we may enter into our initial Business Combinationwith a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines, and as a result, the target business with which we enter into our initialBusiness Combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines. Although we have identified generalcriteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses, it is possible that a target business with which we enter into ourinitial Business Combination will not have all of these positive attributes. If we complete our initial Business Combination with a targetthat does not meet some or all of these guidelines, such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that doesmeet all of our general criteria and guidelines. In addition, if we announce a prospective initial Business Combination with a targetthat does not meet our general criteria and guidelines, a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights, which maymake it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certainamount of cash. In addition, if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approvalfor business or other legal reasons, it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our initial Business Combinationif the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination,our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon theconsummation of our Initial Public Offering) on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certaincircumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account uponthe consummation of our Initial Public Offering) on the redemption of their shares. See “Risk Factors
— If thirdparties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount receivedby stockholders may be less than $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our InitialPublic Offering)” and other risk factors below. We may seek initial Business Combination opportunitieswith a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue, cash flow or earnings, which could subjectus to volatile revenues, cash flows or earnings or difficulty in retaining key personnel. To the extent we complete ourinitial Business Combination with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenues or earnings,we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine. These risks include volatile revenuesor earnings and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel. Although our officers and directors will endeavor to evaluate therisks inherent in a particular target business, we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factorsand we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence. Furthermore, some of these risks may be outside of our control and leaveus with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business. We are not required to obtain a fairness opinion,and consequently, our stockholders may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fairto our company from a financial point of view. Unless we complete our initialBusiness Combination with an affiliated entity or our board cannot independently determine the fair market value of the target businessor businesses, we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or from another independent entitythat commonly renders valuation opinions that the price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view. If no opinionis obtained, our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors, who will determine fair market value based onstandards generally accepted by the financial community. Such standards used will be disclosed in our proxy materials or tender offerdocuments, as applicable, related to our initial Business Combination. Because we must furnish our stockholders withtarget business financial statements, we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial Business Combination withsome prospective target businesses. The federal proxy rules require thata proxy statement with respect to a vote on an initial Business Combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historicaland/or pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports. We will include the same financial statement disclosure in connectionwith our tender offer documents, whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules. These financial statements may be requiredto be prepared in accordance with, or be reconciled to, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, or GAAP,or international financial reporting standards as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board, or IFRS, depending on the circumstancesand the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the Public Company AccountingOversight Board (United States), or PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses wemay acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such financial statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordancewith federal proxy rules and complete our initial Business Combination within the prescribed time frame. 27  Compliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Actmay make it more difficult for us to effectuate our initial Business Combination, require substantial financial and management resources,and increase the time and costs of completing an initial Business Combination. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-OxleyAct requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the yearended December 31, 2022. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer, and no longer qualifyas an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirementon our internal control over financial reporting. Further, for as long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be requiredto comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting.The fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act particularly burdensome onus as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our initial Business Combination maynot be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of its internal controls. The development of theinternal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to completeany such Business Combination. We do not have a specified maximum redemptionthreshold. The absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete an initial Business Combination with whicha substantial majority of our stockholders do not agree. Our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificateof Incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold. As a result, we may be able to complete our initial BusinessCombination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders do not agree with the transaction and have redeemed their sharesor, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial Business Combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initialbusiness combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to ourSponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to payfor all public shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the termsof the proposed initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the initial BusinessCombination or redeem any shares, all public shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we instead maysearch for an alternate Business Combination. The provisions of our Fifth Amended and RestatedCertificate of Incorporation that relate to our pre-initial Business Combination activity (and corresponding provisions of the agreementgoverning the release of funds from our Trust Account), may be amended with the approval of holders of 65% of our Common Stock, whichis a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies. It may be easier for us, therefore, to amend our Fifth Amendedand Restated Certificate of Incorporation and the Third Amended and Restated Investment Management Trust Agreement to facilitate the completionof an initial Business Combination that some of our stockholders may not support. Our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificateof Incorporation provides that any of its provisions related to pre-initial Business Combination activity (including the requirement todeposit proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants into the Trust Account and not release such amountsexcept in specified circumstances, and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein and including to permitus to withdraw funds from the Trust Account such that the per share amount investors will receive upon any redemption or liquidation issubstantially reduced or eliminated) may be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our Common Stock entitled to vote thereon, and correspondingprovisions of the Third Amended and Restated Investment Management Trust Agreement governing the release of funds from our Trust Accountmay be amended if approved by holders of 65% of our Common Stock entitled to vote thereon. In all other instances, our Fifth Amended andRestated Certificate of Incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our outstanding Common Stock entitled to vote thereon,subject to applicable provisions of the DGCL or applicable stock exchange rules. We may not issue additional securities that can voteon amendments to our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. Our initial stockholders, who collectively beneficiallyowned up to 20% of our Common Stock following the closing of the Initial Public Offering (assuming they did not purchase any Units inthe Initial Public Offering or thereafter), will participate in any vote to amend our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporationand/or our Third Amended and Restated Investment Management Trust Agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose.As a result, we may be able to amend the provisions of our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation which govern our pre-initialBusiness Combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies, and this may increase our ability to complete an initialBusiness Combination with which you do not agree. Our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our Fifth Amendedand Restated Certificate of Incorporation.  Our Sponsor, officers and directorshave agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificateof Incorporation (i) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to offer redemption rights in connection with any proposed initialBusiness Combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete ourinitial Business Combination on or prior to July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not to continue to exercise our remainingMonthly Extension Options), or (ii) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial BusinessCombination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of anysuch amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, divided by thenumber of then outstanding public shares. These agreements are contained in a letter agreement that we have entered into with our Sponsor,officers and directors. Our stockholders are not parties to, or third-party beneficiaries of, these agreements and, as a result, willnot have the ability to pursue remedies against our Sponsor, officers or directors for any breach of these agreements. As a result, inthe event of a breach, our stockholders would need to pursue a stockholder derivative action, subject to applicable law. 28  In order to effectuate an initial BusinessCombination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and other governing instruments,including their warrant agreements. We cannot assure our stockholders that we will not seek to amend our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificateof Incorporation or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial Business Combination thatour stockholders may not support. In order to effectuate an initialBusiness Combination, blank check companies have, in the recent past, amended various provisions of their charters and modified governinginstruments, including their warrant agreements. For example, blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination,increased redemption thresholds and extended the time to consummate an initial business combination and, with respect to their warrants,amended their warrant agreements to require the warrants to be exchanged for cash and/or other securities. To the extent we seek to amendour organizational documents in a way that would be deemed to fundamentally change the nature of any securities offered through the InitialPublic Offering, we would register, or seek an exemption from registration for, the affected securities. We cannot assure you that wewill not seek to amend our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or governing instruments or further extend the timeto consummate an initial Business Combination in order to effectuate our initial Business Combination (in addition to the extension oftime permitted through the exercise of our remaining Monthly Extension Options). Alternatively, we may proposean amendment to our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to extend the timing of our obligation to allow redemptionin connection with our initial Business Combination. In such case, our stockholders would be required to approve such amendment and wewould be obligated to offer to redeem our public shares in connection therewith. We may issue our shares to investors in connectionwith our initial Business Combination at a price that is less than the prevailing market price of our shares at that time. In connection with our initial BusinessCombination, we may issue shares to investors in private placement transactions (so-called PIPE transactions) at a price of $10.00 pershare or which approximates the per-share amounts in our Trust Account at such time, which is generally approximately $10.00. The purposeof such issuances will be to enable us to provide sufficient liquidity to the post-initial Business Combination entity. The price of theshares we issue may therefore be less, and potentially significantly less, than the market price for our shares at such time. We may be unable to obtain additional financing tocomplete our initial Business Combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business, which could compel us to restructureor abandon a particular business combination. We intend to target businesses largerthan we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants. As a result,we may be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed initial Business Combination. We cannot assure you that suchfinancing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when neededto complete our initial Business Combination, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular BusinessCombination and seek an alternative target business candidate. Further, the amount of additional financing we may be required to obtaincould increase as a result of future growth capital needs for any particular transaction, the depletion of the available net proceedsin search of a target business, the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from stockholders who elect redemptionin connection with our initial Business Combination and/or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection withour initial Business Combination. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive onlyapproximately $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering)plus any pro rata interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes on the liquidationof our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless. In addition, even if we do not need additional financing to complete ourinitial Business Combination, we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secureadditional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business. None of our officers,directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our initial Business Combination. Ifwe are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may only receive approximately $10.15 per share (theamount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) on the liquidation of our TrustAccount and our warrants will expire worthless. Furthermore, as described in the risk factor entitled “If third parties bringclaims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reduced and the per-share redemption amount received by stockholdersmay be less than $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering),”under certain circumstances our public stockholders may receive less than $10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in ourTrust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) upon the liquidation of the Trust Account. 29  Our initial stockholders may exert a substantialinfluence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentially in a manner that you do not support. Our initial stockholders owned sharesrepresenting 20% of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering and a greaterpercentage as a result of the redemptions which occurred at the Special Meeting in connection with the adoption of our Fifth Amended andRestated Certificate of Incorporation. Accordingly, they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote, potentiallyin a manner that you do not support, including amendments to our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and approvalof major corporate transactions. If our initial stockholders purchased any Units in the Initial Public Offering or if our initial stockholderspurchase any additional shares of Common Stock in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions, this would increase their control.Factors that would be considered in making such additional purchases would include consideration of the current trading price of our publicshares. In addition, our board of directors, whose members were elected by our initial stockholders, is divided into three classes, eachof which will generally serve for a term of three years with only one class of directors being elected in each year. We may not hold asecond annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our initial Business Combination, in which caseall of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the initial Business Combination. If there is asecond annual meeting, as a consequence of our “staggered” board of directors, only a minority of the board of directors willbe considered for election and our initial stockholders, because of their ownership position, will have considerable influence regardingthe outcome. Accordingly, our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our initial BusinessCombination. Resources could be wasted in researching BusinessCombinations that are not completed, which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with anotherbusiness. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately $10.15per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering), or less than suchamount in certain circumstances, on the liquidation of our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless. We anticipate thatthe investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documentsand other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants, attorneys, consultantsand others. If we decide not to complete a specific initial Business Combination, the costs incurred up to that point for the proposedtransaction likely would not be recoverable. Furthermore, if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business, we may failto complete our initial Business Combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control. Any such event will resultin a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or mergewith another business. If we are unable to complete our initial Business Combination, our public stockholders may receive only approximately$10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) on the liquidationof our Trust Account and our warrants will expire worthless. In certain circumstances, our public stockholders may receive less than$10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering) on the redemptionof their shares. See “— If third parties bring claims against us, the proceeds held in the Trust Account could be reducedand the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than $10.15 per share (theamount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering)” and other risk factorsbelow. We may have a limited ability to assess the managementof a prospective target business and, as a result, may affect our initial Business Combination with a target business whose managementmay not have the skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company, which could, in turn, negatively impact the value ofour stockholders’ investment in us. When evaluating the desirabilityof effecting our initial Business Combination with a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business’ managementmay be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target’s management, therefore,may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we suspected. Should the target’smanagement not possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company, the operations and profitabilityof the post-combination business may be negatively impacted. Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders followingthe initial Business Combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedyfor such reduction in value. Our ability to successfully effect our initialBusiness Combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel, some of whom mayjoin us following our initial Business Combination. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitabilityof our post-combination business. Our ability to successfully effectour initial Business Combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The role of our key personnel in the target business,however, cannot presently be ascertained. Although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior managementor advisory positions following our initial Business Combination, it is likely that some or all of the management of the target businesswill remain in place. While we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we employ after our initial Business Combination, we cannotassure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct. These individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirementsof operating a company regulated by the SEC, which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar withsuch requirements. In addition, the officers and directors of an initial Business Combination candidate may resign upon completion ofour initial Business Combination. The departure of an initial Business Combination target’s key personnel could negatively impactthe operations and profitability of our post-combination business. The role of an initial Business Combination candidate’s key personnelupon the completion of our initial Business Combination cannot be ascertained at this time. Although we contemplate that certain membersof an initial Business Combination candidate’s management team will remain associated with the initial Business Combination candidatefollowing our initial Business Combination, it is possible that members of the management of an initial Business Combination candidatewill not wish to remain in place. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our post- combinationbusiness. 30  If we effect our initial Business Combinationwith a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States, we would be subject to a variety of additional risks thatmay negatively impact our operations. If we effect our initial Business Combinationwith a company with operations or opportunities outside of the United States, we may be subject to special considerations or risks associatedwith companies operating in an international setting, including any of the following: ●higher costs and difficulties inherent in managing cross-borderbusiness operations and complying with different commercial and legal requirements of overseas markets; ●rules and regulations regarding currency redemption; ●complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals; ●laws governing the manner in which future Business Combinationsmay be effected; ●tariffs and trade barriers; ●regulations related to customs and import/export matters; ●longer payment cycles and challenges in collecting accountsreceivable; ●tax issues, including but not limited to tax law changesand variations in tax laws as compared to the United States; ●currency fluctuations and exchange controls; ●rates of inflation; ●cultural and language differences; ●employment regulations; ●changes in industry, regulatory or environmental standardswithin the jurisdictions where we operate; ●crime, strikes, riots, civil disturbances, terrorist attacks,natural disasters and wars; ●deterioration of political relations with the United States;and ●government appropriations of assets. We may not be able to adequatelyaddress these additional risks. If we were unable to do so, our operations might suffer, which may adversely impact our results of operationsand financial condition. We may be deemed a “foreign person”under the regulations relating to CFIUS and our failure to obtain any required approvals within the requisite time period may requireus to liquidate. Our Sponsor is notcontrolled by and does not have substantial ties with any non-U.S. person. Mr. Desai, who is the Company’s Chief ExecutiveOfficer, is a U.S. citizen. As a result, we do not expect the Company to be considered a “foreign person” under theregulations administered by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (“CFIUS”). However, if our initialBusiness Combination becomes subject to CFIUS review, CFIUS may decide to block or delay our initial Business Combination, imposeconditions to mitigate national security concerns with respect to such initial Business Combination or order us to divest all or aportion of a U.S. business of the combined company without first obtaining CFIUS clearance, which may limit the attractiveness of orprevent us from pursuing certain initial Business Combination opportunities that we believe would otherwise be beneficial to us andour shareholders. As a result, the pool of potential targets with which we could complete a initial Business Combination may belimited and we may be adversely affected in terms of competing with other special purpose acquisition companies. 31  Moreover, the process of governmentreview, whether by the CFIUS or otherwise, could be lengthy and we have limited time to complete our initial Business Combination. Ifwe cannot complete our initial Business Combination on or prior to July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not to continueto exercise our remaining Monthly Extension Options), because the review process drags on beyond such timeframe or because our initialBusiness Combination is ultimately prohibited by CFIUS or another U.S. government entity, we may be required to liquidate. If we liquidate,our public stockholders may only receive an amount per share that will be determined by when we liquidate, and our warrants will expireworthless. This will also cause you to lose the investment opportunity in a target company and the chance of realizing future gains onyour investment through any price appreciation in the combined company. We may issue notes or other debt securities, orotherwise incur substantial debt, to complete an initial Business Combination, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial conditionand thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders’ investment in us. We may choose to incur substantialdebt to complete our initial Business Combination. We have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained fromthe lender a waiver of any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the Trust Account. As such, no issuanceof debt will affect the per-share amount available for redemption from the Trust Account. Nevertheless, the incurrence of debt could havea variety of negative effects, including: ●default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenuesafter an initial Business Combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations; ●acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtednesseven if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financialratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant; ●our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest,if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; ●our inability to obtain necessary additional financing ifthe debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding; ●our inability to pay dividends on our Common Stock; ●using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principaland interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our Common Stock if declared, our ability to pay expenses,make capital expenditures and acquisitions, and fund other general corporate purposes; ●limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reactingto changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate; ●increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic,industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; ●limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts forexpenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, and execution of our strategy; and ●other disadvantages compared to our competitors who haveless debt. We may only be able to complete an initial BusinessCombination with the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants which will cause us to besolely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of services and limited operating activities. This lack of diversificationmay negatively impact our operating results and profitability. As a result of the shareholder redemptionswe experienced in connection with the adoption of our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the funds available inour Trust Account and available for payment of consideration in connection with a potential initial Business Combination were diminished.As of March 19, 2024, we had approximately $6,145,817 in our Trust Account. We may effectuate our initialBusiness Combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time. However,we may not be able to effectuate our initial Business Combination with more than one target business because of various factors, includingthe existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the SEC thatpresent operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis. Bycompleting our initial Business Combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic,competitive and regulatory developments. Further, we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreadingof risks or offsetting of losses, unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several Business Combinations in differentindustries or different areas of a single industry. In addition, we intend to focus our search for an initial Business Combination ina single industry. Accordingly, the prospects for our success may be: ●solely dependent upon the performance of a single business,property or asset, or ●dependent upon the development or market acceptance of asingle or limited number of products, processes or services. This lack of diversification maysubject us to numerous economic, competitive and regulatory risks, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon theparticular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our initial Business Combination. 32  We may attempt to simultaneously complete BusinessCombinations with multiple prospective targets, which may hinder our ability to complete our initial Business Combination and give riseto increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability. If we determine to simultaneouslyacquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers, we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of itsbusiness is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other Business Combinations, which may make it more difficult for us, and delayour ability, to complete our initial Business Combination. We do not, however, intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industriesin conjunction with our initial Business Combination. With multiple Business Combinations, we could also face additional risks, includingadditional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations (if there are multiple sellers)and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companiesin a single operating business. If we are unable to adequately address these risks, it could negatively impact our profitability and resultsof operations. We may attempt to complete our initial BusinessCombination with a private company about which little information is available, which may result in an initial Business Combination witha company that is not as profitable as we suspected, if at all. In pursuing our initial Business Combinationstrategy, we may seek to effectuate our initial Business Combination with a privately held company. Very little public information generallyexists about private companies, and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial Business Combinationon the basis of limited information, which may result in an initial Business Combination with a company that is not as profitable as wesuspected, if at all. Cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents couldadversely affect our business by causing a disruption to our operations, a compromise or corruption of our confidential information andconfidential information in our possession and/or damage to our business relationships, any of which could negatively impact our business,financial condition and operating results. We and our Sponsor and its affiliatesface increasingly frequent and sophisticated cyber and security threats, with attacks ranging from those common to businesses generallyto those that are more advanced and persistent, which may target us because we may hold confidential and other price sensitive informationabout existing and potential investments. We depend on digital technologies, including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applicationsand services, including those of our Sponsor and its third party vendors, and other third parties. Cyber attacks and other security threatscould originate from a wide variety of sources, including cyber criminals, nation state hackers, hacktivists and other outside parties.As a result, we may face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption with respect to sensitive information resulting from anattack by computer hackers, foreign governments or cyber terrorists. The efficient operation of our businessis dependent on computer hardware and software systems, as well as data processing systems and the secure processing, storage and transmissionof information, which are vulnerable to security breaches and cyber incidents. A cyber incident is considered to be any adverse eventthat threatens the confidentiality, integrity or availability of our information resources. These incidents may be an intentional attackor an unintentional event and could involve gaining unauthorized access to our information systems for purposes of misappropriating assets,stealing confidential information, corrupting data or causing operational disruption. In addition, we and our employees may be the targetof fraudulent emails or other targeted attempts to gain unauthorized access to proprietary or sensitive information. The result of theseincidents may include disrupted operations, misstated or unreliable financial data, increased cybersecurity protection and insurance costs,litigation and damage to our business relationships. Any processes, procedures and internal controls we may implement to mitigate cybersecurityrisks and cyber intrusions, as well as our increased awareness of the nature and extent of a risk of a cyber-incident, will not guaranteethat a cyber-incident will not occur or that our financial results, operations or confidential information will not be negatively impactedby such an incident, especially because the cyber-incident techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched and becausecyber-incidents can originate from a wide variety of sources. We may not have sufficient funding and resources to comply with evolvingcybersecurity regulations and to continually monitor and enhance our cybersecurity procedures and controls. We depend on digital technologies,including information systems, infrastructure and cloud applications and services, including those of third parties with which we maydeal. Sophisticated and deliberate attacks on, or security breaches in, our systems or infrastructure, or the systems or infrastructureof third parties or the cloud, could lead to corruption or misappropriation of our assets, proprietary information and sensitive or confidentialdata. As an early stage company without significant investments in data security protection, we may not be sufficiently protected againstsuch occurrences. We may not have sufficient resources to adequately protect against, or to investigate and remediate any vulnerabilityto, cyber incidents. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have adverse consequences on our businessand lead to financial loss. Our initial Business Combination and our structurethereafter may not be tax-efficient to our shareholders and warrant holders. As a result of our initial Business Combination, our taxobligations may be more complex, burdensome and uncertain. Although we will attemptto structure our initial Business Combination in a tax-efficient manner, tax structuring considerations are complex, the relevantfacts and law are uncertain and may change, and we may prioritize commercial and other considerations over tax considerations. Forexample, in connection with our initial Business Combination and subject to any requisite shareholder approval, we may structure ourinitial Business Combination in a manner that requires shareholders and/or warrant holders to recognize gain or income for taxpurposes, effect an initial Business Combination with a target company in another jurisdiction, or reincorporate in a differentjurisdiction (including, but not limited to, the jurisdiction in which the target company or business is located). We do not intendto make any cash distributions to shareholders or warrant holders to pay taxes in connection with our initial Business Combinationor thereafter. Accordingly, a shareholder or a warrant holder may need to satisfy any liability resulting from our initial BusinessCombination with cash from its own funds or by selling all or a portion of the shares received. In addition, shareholders andwarrant holders may also be subject to additional income, withholding or other taxes with respect to their ownership of us after ourinitial Business Combination. 33  In addition, we may effect aBusiness Combination with a target company that has business operations outside of the United States, and possibly, business operationsin multiple jurisdictions. If we effect such a Business Combination, we could be subject to significant income, withholding and othertax obligations in a number of jurisdictions with respect to income, operations and subsidiaries related to those jurisdictions. Due tothe complexity of tax obligations and filings in other jurisdictions, we may have a heightened risk related to audits or examinationsby U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. taxing authorities. This additional complexity and risk could have an adverse effect on ourafter-tax profitability and financial condition. Risks Relating to the VasoBusiness Combination We cannot assure you that we will be able to completethe proposed Vaso Business Combination or complete an alternative Initial Business Combination by July 19, 2024, the date by which weare required to complete our Initial Business Combination or be forced to liquidate (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not tocontinue to exercise our remaining Monthly Extension Options). If we are not able to complete theVaso Business Combination with Vaso Corporation or complete an alternative Initial Business Combination by July 19, 2024 (or such earlierapplicable date if we opt not to continue to exercise our remaining Monthly Extension Options), we will (i) cease all operations exceptfor the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the PublicShares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the Trust Account including interest earnedon the funds held in the Trust Account and not previously released to us to pay the Company’s franchise and income taxes (less upto $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding Public Shares, which redemption will completelyextinguish Public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any),subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of the Company’sremaining stockholders and the Company’s board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to the Company’sobligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In such case, the publicstockholders would only receive the applicable per-share price described above in connection with redeeming their shares and the publicwarrants would expire worthless. The proposed Vaso Business Combination may not becompleted on the anticipated terms, and there are uncertainties and risks related to consummating the proposed Vaso Business Combination. The Closing may not be completed onthe anticipated terms, and there are uncertainties and risks related to consummating the proposed Vaso Business Combination. Even if theVaso Business Combination Agreement is approved by the stockholders of the Company, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived beforethe parties to Vaso Business Combination Agreement are obligated to complete the Vaso Business Combination. The Company does not controlthe satisfaction of all of such conditions. The Company and Vaso may not satisfy all of the closing conditions in the Vaso Business CombinationAgreement. If the closing conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Vaso Business Combination will not occur, or will be delayed pendinglater satisfaction or waiver, and such delay may cause the Company and Vaso to each lose some or all of the intended benefits of the VasoBusiness Combination. Subsequent to the Closing of our proposed Vaso BusinessCombination, the Surviving Company may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges thatcould have a significant negative effect on its financial condition and the share price of the Company’s Common Stock, which couldcause you to lose some or all of your investment. Although the Company has conducteddue diligence on Vaso, it cannot assure you that this diligence has identified all material issues that may be present within Vaso, thatit is possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of Vaso’s andoutside of the Company’s or the Surviving Company’s control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, the SurvivingCompany may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure its operations, or incur impairment or other charges that couldresult in it reporting losses. Even if due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previouslyknown risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with the Company’s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges maybe non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on the Company’s liquidity, the fact that the Company reports charges of thisnature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the Company or its securities. Accordingly, any of the Company’s publicstockholders who choose to remain stockholders of the Company following the Vaso Business Combination could suffer a reduction in thevalue of their securities. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfullyclaim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them, orif they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy solicitation relating to the Vaso BusinessCombination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission. An active, liquid trading market for the Company’ssecurities may not develop, which may limit your ability to sell such securities. An active trading market for the Company’ssecurities may never develop or be sustained following the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination. A public trading market havingthe desirable characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends upon the existence of willing buyers and sellers at any giventime, such existence being dependent upon the individual decisions of buyers and sellers over which neither we nor any market maker hascontrol. The failure of an active and liquid trading market to develop and continue would likely have a material adverse effect on thevalue of the Company’s Common Stock. The market price of the Company’s Common Stock may decline, and you may not be able tosell your shares of the Company’s Common Stock at all. An inactive market may also impair our ability to raise capital to continueto fund operations by issuing shares of the Company’s Common Stock. 34  During the pendency of the proposed Vaso BusinessCombination, the Company will not be able to enter into a business combination with another party because of restrictions in the VasoBusiness Combination Agreement. Furthermore, certain provisions of the Vaso Business Combination Agreement will discourage third partiesfrom submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the VasoBusiness Combination Agreement. Covenants in the Vaso Business CombinationAgreement impede the ability of the Company to make acquisitions or complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course ofbusiness pending completion of the Vaso Business Combination. As a result, the Company may be at a disadvantage to its competitors duringthat period. While the Vaso Business Combination Agreement is in effect, neither the Company nor Vaso nor any of their respective affiliates,subsidiaries or representatives may (a) solicit or initiate any competing transaction or take any action to knowingly facilitateor encourage any person or group of persons other than the parties and their respective affiliates, representatives and agents (a “CompetingParty”), to enter into any agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet or definitive agreement, or make any filing withthe SEC (including the filing of any registration statement) or other governmental entity, with respect to a competing transaction; (b) enterinto, participate in or continue or otherwise engage in any discussions or negotiations with any Competing Party regarding a competingtransaction; (c) furnish (including through any virtual data room) any information relating to any party or subsidiary thereof orany of their respective assets or businesses, or afford access to the assets, business, properties, books or records of any party or anysubsidiary thereof to a Competing Party, in all cases, for the purpose of assisting with or facilitating a competing transaction; (d) approve,endorse or recommend any competing transaction; or (e) enter into a competing transaction or any agreement, arrangement or understanding(including any letter of intent or term sheet) relating to a competing transaction or publicly announce an intention to do so. If theVaso Business Combination is not completed, these provisions will make it more difficult to complete an alternative business combinationfollowing the termination of the Vaso Business Combination Agreement due to the passage of time during which these provisions have remainedin effect. We and Vaso will incur significant transaction andtransition costs in connection with the proposed Vaso Business Combination. We and Vaso expect to incur significant,non-recurring costs in connection with consummating the Vaso Business Combination and operating as a public company following the consummationof the Vaso Business Combination. We and Vaso may also incur additional costs to retain key employees. We will incur and be responsiblefor the expenses and fees as set forth in, and in connection with, the Vaso Business Combination Agreement. There can be no assurancethat such fees and expenses will not be greater than expected or that there will be no unexpected costs related to the Vaso Business Combination. Our Sponsor, our officers and our directors may beargued to have interests which differ from, conflict with, or are adverse to, the interests of our other stakeholders, including the holdersof our Public Shares and of our other securities, and such differing, conflicting or adverse interests may have influenced, or influencein the future, their support for the Vaso Business Combination. The personal and financial interestsof our Sponsor, our officers and our directors may have influenced, or may influence in the future, their respective motivations for identifyingand selecting Vaso as a target for our initial Business Combination, their support for entering into the Vaso Business Combination Agreement,their support for completing the Vaso Business Combination and with respect to their views regarding the on-going operations of the combinedcompany following the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination. Circumstances which may be argued to potentially give rise to conflictinginterests with respect to our Sponsor, our officers and our directors and our other stakeholders, including the holders of our PublicShares and our other security holders include, but are not limited to, the fact that: ●Immediately prior to the consummation of the Vaso BusinessCombination, our Sponsor will own 2,500,000 Founder Shares, which were acquired by the Sponsor prior to our IPO for an aggregate purchaseprice of $25,000. Certain of the Company’s officers have pecuniary interests in such Founder Shares through their direct or indirectownership interests in the Sponsor. Based on a sales price of $10.95 per Founder Share, $10.95 being the last reported sales price ofour Common Stock as reported by Nasdaq on March 22, 2024, such Founder Shares could be deemed to have an approximate market value of$27,375,000 as of such date (provided that such figure does not give effect to the forfeiture of 1,750,000 Founder Shares by the Sponsorpursuant to the terms of the Vaso Business Combination Agreement, which will result in the Sponsor holding 750,000 Founder Shares immediatelyfollowing the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination, and would therefore result in such remaining Founder Shares potentiallybeing deemed to have a market value of $8,212,500 (utilizing the same $10.95 per Founder Share market price as used for the previouscalculation)). In the event we do not consummate the Vaso Business Combination, or any other Business Combination, we will likely chooseto terminate our operations and liquidate, which will have the effect of rendering such Founder Shares held by our Sponsor valueless.Therefore, our Sponsor will lose its entire investment in the Founder Shares if an initial Business Combination is not completed, a circumstancewhich may be argued to create a conflict of interest that may have caused, cause or otherwise motivate our Sponsor, our officers andour directors to support and/or approve the Vaso Business Combination, or any other Business Combination, in lieu of liquidating theCompany, potentially at the expense of our other stakeholders. Additionally, the Sponsor and Vaso have agreed to enter into a Put OptionAgreement in connection with the Vaso Business Combination, whereby Vaso shall grant certain put rights (the “Put Option”)to the Sponsor with respect to the Founder Shares held by the Sponsor following the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination, withsuch Put Option requiring Vaso to purchase the Founder Shares held by the Sponsor following the closing of the transaction from the Sponsor,at the Sponsor’s election, at certain pre-agreed times and prices, including notably at a minimum purchase price of $8.00 per FounderShare (subject to certain adjustments and exceptions as further described in the Put Option Agreement). If the Sponsor exercises thePut Option granted to it pursuant to the Put Option Agreement in full and at a purchase price of $8.00 per Founder Share, the Sponsorshall receive aggregate proceeds of $6,000,000 as a result of the sale to Vaso of the 750,000 Founder Shares it will hold following theclosing of the Vaso Business Combination. No other parties besides the Sponsor shall receive similar rights as those granted to the Sponsorin connection with the Put Option Agreement with respect to the Vaso Business Combination. The existence of the Put Option may thereforebe argued to create a further incentive for our Sponsor, our officers and our directors to have supported entry into the Vaso BusinessCombination Agreement and to support the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination, potentially at the expense of our other stakeholders,which are not receiving similar rights to those granted to the Sponsor by the Put Option Agreement. 35  ●Immediately prior to the consummation of the Vaso BusinessCombination, our Sponsor will own 7,133,333 Private Placement Warrants, which were purchased by the Sponsor concurrently with the closingof our IPO for an aggregate purchase price of $5,350,000. Certain of the Company’s officers have pecuniary interests in such PrivatePlacement Warrants through their direct or indirect ownership interests in the Sponsor. Based on a sales price of $0.0315 per PrivatePlacement Warrant, $0.0315 being the last reported sales price of our public warrants as reported by Nasdaq on March 22, 2024, such PrivatePlacement Warrants could be deemed to have an approximate market value of $224,700 as of such date (provided that such figure does notgive effect to the forfeiture of 6,133,000 Private Placement Warrants by the Sponsor pursuant to the terms of the Vaso Business CombinationAgreement, which will result in the Sponsor holding 1,000,000 Private Placement Warrants immediately following the consummation of theVaso Business Combination, and would therefore result in such remaining Private Placement Warrants potentially being deemed to have amarket value of $31,500 (utilizing the same $0.0315 per Private Placement Warrant market price as used for the previous calculation)).In the event we do not consummate the Vaso Business Combination, or any other initial Business Combination, we will likely choose toterminate our operations and liquidate, which will have the effect of rendering such Private Placement Warrants held by our Sponsor valueless.Therefore, our Sponsor will lose its entire investment in the Private Placement Warrants if an initial Business Combination is not completed,a circumstance which may be argued to create a conflict of interest that may have caused, cause or otherwise motivate our Sponsor, ourofficers and our directors to support and/or approve the Vaso Business Combination, or any other initial Business Combination, in lieuof liquidating the Company, potentially at the expense of our other stakeholders. ●Our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporationrequires the Company to complete an initial Business Combination prior to July 19, 2024 (assuming the Company exercises in full eachof its Monthly Extension Options, unless the Company submits, and its stockholders approve an extension of such deadline). As of January2, 2024, the Sponsor and its affiliates had invested a total of $5,742,000 in the Company, such investment consisting of (i) $25,000with respect to the purchase of 2,500,000 Founder Shares prior to the Company’s IPO, (ii) $5,350,000 with respect to the purchaseof 7,133,333 Private Placement Warrants concurrently with the Company’s IPO and (iii) $367,000 of working capital loans made bythe Sponsor to the Company. The Sponsor may also ultimately be found responsible for third-party accrued and unpaid expenses incurredby the Company if an initial Business Combination is not consummated prior to the termination deadline. If the Vaso Business Combination,or any other initial Business Combination is not consummated, in a timely manner, or at all, and in any respect prior to the July 19,2024 termination deadline, the Company will be forced to wind up, dissolve and liquidate in accordance with the Fifth Amended and RestatedCertificate of Incorporation promptly following the expiration of such deadline, at which time the Sponsor’s full investment inCompany would be rendered valueless. The existence of a termination deadline with respect to the consummation of an initial BusinessCombination may be argued to create a conflict of interest that may have caused, cause or otherwise motivate our Sponsor, our officersand our directors to support and/or approve the Vaso Business Combination, or any other initial Business Combination, in order to increasethe likelihood of consummating an initial Business Combination prior to such termination deadline and in lieu of liquidating the Company,potentially at the expense of our other stakeholders. ●Certain of our officers and the members of our board of directorsmay now, or in the future, have interests with respect to the Vaso Business Combination and the on-going operations of the combined companyfollowing the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination which differ from yours, including, for example, arrangements for continuedservice as directors or in other roles with respect to the combined company following the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination,which such individuals may be compensated for, in various forms. Although at this time it is not anticipated that any of the Company’scurrent officers or directors will have any such roles in the combined company, such officers and directors may have such roles in thefuture. ●Our Sponsor and each of our directors and officers have eachagreed to (i) waive their redemption rights with respect to any Public Shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of theVaso Business Combination, with any Public Shares held by them excluded from the pro rata calculation used to determine the per-shareredemption price with respect to the Common Stock redemptions from our Trust Account in connection with the public vote to approve theVaso Business Combination as well as (ii) vote any shares of the Common Stock owned by them in favor of the Vaso Business Combination.Although the Sponsor, our officers and our directors do not own any shares of our Common Stock apart from their direct or indirect ownershipof our Founder Shares, such ownership of our Founder Shares currently confers them with a collective ownership of 81.9% of our issuedand outstanding shares of Common Stock, and as a result a majority of the voting power associated with our Common Stock. The voting powerconferred by such majority ownership by our Sponsor, our officers and our directors may be argued to create potential conflicts withrespect to the support and approval of the Vaso Business Combination when compared to minority shareholders. ●To finance transaction costs in connection with an initialBusiness Combination our Sponsor has provided the Company working capital in the form of loans. If the Company consummates an initialBusiness Combination, the Company may repay such working capital loans out of any proceeds of the Trust Account released to the Company.Otherwise, such working capital loans would only be repaid only out of funds held outside the Trust Account, if any. As of the date hereof,the Sponsor has funded working capital loans to the Company totaling $367,000. The existence of such working capital loans made by theSponsor to the Company may be deemed to have created a conflict of interest by influencing the Sponsor, our officers and our directorsto support the Vaso Business Combination in an effort to recoup the value of such working capital loans. 36  ●Pursuant to the terms of the Vaso Business Combination Agreement,at the effective time of the Vaso Business Combination, the Company’s certificate of incorporation and the bylaws will, from andafter the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, exculpation,advancement and expense reimbursement than are set forth in the Company’s current governing documents, which provisions may notbe amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination in any mannerthat would affect adversely the rights thereunder of any individual who, at or prior to the consummation of the Vaso Business Combination,served as a director, manager or officer of the Company, unless such modification shall be required by applicable law. The existenceof such provisions with respect to indemnification, exculpation, advancement and expense reimbursement in the Vaso Business CombinationAgreement may be argued to create a conflict of interest that may have caused, cause or otherwise motivate our Sponsor, our officersand our directors to support and/or approve the Vaso Business Combination, or any other initial Business Combination, in order to increasethe likelihood of receiving the benefit of such provisions, potentially at the expense of our other stakeholders. For more information concerning the interests of the Sponsor and theCompany’s officers and directors, please see the proxy statement/prospectus filed with the SEC on Form S-4/A on February 14, 2024(Registration No. 333-276422), as may be amended from time to time. Risks Relating to our Sponsorand Management Team Our key personnel may negotiate employment or consultingagreements as well as reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, if any, with a target business in connection with a particular BusinessCombination. These agreements may provide for them to receive compensation or reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses, if any, followingour initial Business Combination and as a result, may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular BusinessCombination is the most advantageous. Our key personnel may be able to remainwith the company after the completion of our initial Business Combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consultingagreements in connection with the initial Business Combination. Additionally, they may negotiate reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expensesincurred on our behalf prior to the consummation of our initial Business Combination, should they choose to do so. Such negotiations wouldtake place simultaneously with the negotiation of the initial Business Combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensationin the form of cash payments and/or our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the initial Business Combination,or as reimbursement for such out-of-pocket expenses. The Private Placement Warrants will also be worthless if we do not complete our initialBusiness Combination. The personal and financial interests of our officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifyingand selecting a target Business Combination, completing an initial Business Combination and influencing the operation of the businessfollowing the initial Business Combination. This risk may become more acute as the deadline with respect to the time allotted to completeour Business Combination approaches. However, we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of ourinitial Business Combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potentialBusiness Combination. There is no certainty, however, that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our initialBusiness Combination. We cannot assure our stockholders that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positionswith us. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us will be made at the time of our initial BusinessCombination. Past performance by our management team or our advisorsmay not be indicative of future performance of an investment in the Company. Past performance by our managementteam or our advisors is not a guarantee either (i) of success with respect to any Business Combination we may consummate or (ii) thatwe will be able to locate a suitable candidate for our initial Business Combination. Stockholders and potential investors should not relyon the historical record of our management team’s or our advisors’ respective performance as indicative of our future performanceof an investment in the company or the returns the company will, or is likely to, generate going forward. No member of our managementteam has been an officer or director of a special purpose acquisition corporation in the past. Additionally, in the course of their respectivecareers, members of our management team and our advisors have been involved in businesses and transactions that were not successful. We may seek Business Combination opportunitiesin industries or sectors which may or may not be outside of our management’s area of expertise. We may consummate an initial BusinessCombination with a company in any industry we choose and are not limited to any particular industry or type of business. Although initiallywe intended to focus our search in the cannabis industry, we have entered into the Vaso Business Combination Agreement with Vaso, a companyinvolved in the medical device and medical sales industry. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in anyparticular Business Combination candidate (including Vaso), we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess (or haveadequately ascertained or assessed) all of the significant risk factors. We also cannot assure you that an investment in our securitieswill not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors than a direct investment, if an opportunity were available, in an initialBusiness Combination candidate. Our management’s expertise may not be directly applicable to the evaluation or operation of Vasoor any other Business Combination target we pursue outside of the areas of our management’s expertise, and the information containedin this Form 10-K regarding the areas of our management’s expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business thatwe elect to acquire. As a result, our management may not be able to adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors.Accordingly, any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following our initial Business Combination could suffer a reduction inthe value of their shares. Such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value. We are dependent upon our executive officers and directorsand their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate. Our operations are dependent upona relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success dependson the continued service of our executive officers and directors, at least until we have completed our initial Business Combination. Wedo not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpectedloss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us. 37  Since our Sponsor, officers, and directors, willlose their entire investment in us if our initial Business Combination is not completed (other than with respect to any public sharesacquired during or after the Initial Public Offering), and since our Sponsor, officers, and directors that have interests in Founder Sharesmay profit substantially even under circumstances where our public stockholders would experience losses in connection with their investment,a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular Business Combination target is appropriate for our initial BusinessCombination. In addition, since our Sponsor paid only approximately $0.009 per share for the Founder Shares, certain of our officers anddirectors could potentially make a substantial profit even if we acquire a target business that subsequently declines in value. In February 2021, our Sponsor purchased2,156,250 Founder Shares, and in June 2021, we effected a 1.3333-for-1.0 stock split of our Common Stock, so that our Sponsor owned anaggregate of 2,875,000 Founder Shares prior to the Initial Public Offering. Our Sponsor paid an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, orapproximately $0.009 per share, for the Founder Shares. The number of Founder Shares issued was determined based on the expectation thatsuch Founder Shares would represent 20% of the outstanding shares after the Initial Public Offering. On November 29, 2021, the Sponsorforfeited 375,000 of such Founder Shares due to the expiration of the over-allotment option. As of December 31, 2023, our Sponsor continuedto hold a balance of 2,500,000 Founder Shares. The Founder Shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial Business Combination.In addition, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 7,133,333 Private Placement Warrants, each exercisable for three quarters of one shareof Common Stock at $11.50 per share, for a purchase price of $5,350,000, or $0.75 per warrant, that will also be worthless if we do notcomplete an initial Business Combination. Holders of Founder Shares have agreed (A) to vote any shares owned by them in favor of any proposedinitial Business Combination and (B) not to redeem any Founder Shares in connection with a stockholder vote to approve a proposed initialBusiness Combination. In addition, we may obtain loans from our Sponsor, affiliates of our Sponsor or an officer or director. The PrivatePlacement Warrants will also be worthless if we do not complete our initial Business Combination. The personal and financial interestsof our officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target Business Combination, completing aninitial Business Combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial Business Combination. This risk may becomemore acute as the deadline for our completion of an initial Business Combination approaches. Our officers and directors will allocate their timeto other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs. This conflictof interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial Business Combination. Our officers and directors are not requiredto, and will not, commit their full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between ouroperations and our search for an initial Business Combination and their other businesses. We do not intend to have any full-time employeesprior to the completion of our initial Business Combination. Each of our officers is engaged in other business endeavors for which hemay be entitled to substantial compensation and our officers are not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours per week toour affairs. Our independent directors may also serve as officers or board members for other entities. Our officers have agreed not tobecome an officer or director of any other cannabis-focused special purpose acquisition company with a class of securities registeredunder the Exchange Act until we have announced a definitive agreement regarding our initial Business Combination or we have failed tocomplete our initial Business Combination on or prior to July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not to continue to exerciseour remaining Monthly Extension Options). If our officers’ and directors’ other business affairs require them to devote substantialamounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels, it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairswhich may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial Business Combination. For a complete discussion of our officers’and directors’ other business affairs, please see the section of this Form 10-K entitled “Our Management Team.” Our officers, directors and advisors or theiraffiliates have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations and may in the future become affiliated with other entities engagedin business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determiningto which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. Until we consummate our initial BusinessCombination, we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses. Our officers, directors andadvisors or their affiliates have pre-existing fiduciary and contractual obligations to other companies. Accordingly, they may participate in transactions andhave obligations that may be in conflict or competition with our consummation of our initial Business Combination. As a result, a potentialtarget business may be presented by our management team to another entity prior to its presentation to us and we may not be afforded theopportunity to engage in a transaction with such target business. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to whichentity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential targetbusiness may be presented to other entities prior to its presentation to us, subject to our officers’ and directors’ fiduciaryduties under Delaware law. Our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporateopportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacityas a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and wouldotherwise be reasonable for us to pursue, and to the extent the director or officer is permitted to refer that opportunity to us withoutviolating another legal obligation. For a complete discussion of ourofficers’ and directors’ business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of, pleasesee the sections of this Form 10-K entitled “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.” Our officers, directors, security holders and theirrespective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests. We have not adopted a policy thatexpressly prohibits our directors, officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interestin any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. In fact, we mayenter into an initial Business Combination with a target business that is affiliated with our Sponsor, our directors, our advisors orofficers, although we do not intend to do so. We do not have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for theirown account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between theirinterests and ours. 38  We may engage in an initial Business Combinationwith one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our Sponsor, officers, directorsor existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest. In light of the involvement of ourSponsor, officers and directors with other entities, we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our Sponsor, officers,advisors or directors. Our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities, as well as without limitation, thosedescribed under the section of this Form 10-K entitled “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflictsof Interest.” Such entities may compete with us for Business Combination opportunities. Our Sponsor, officers and directorsare not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our initial Business Combination with any entities with whichthey are affiliated, and there have been no preliminary discussions concerning an initial Business Combination with any such entity orentities. Although we will not be specifically focusing on, or targeting, any transaction with any affiliated entities, we would pursuesuch a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for an initial Business Combination as set forth in thesection of this Form 10-K entitled “Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of a Business Combination” and suchtransaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. Despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independentinvestment banking firm or from another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions, regarding the fairness to our stockholdersfrom a financial point of view of an initial Business Combination with one or more businesses affiliated with our officers, directorsor existing holders, potential conflicts of interest still may exist and, as a result, the terms of the initial Business Combination maynot be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest. Our management may not be able to maintain controlof a target business after our initial Business Combination. We may structure an initial BusinessCombination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than 100% of the equity interestsor assets of a target business, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50%or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for usnot to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. We will not consider any transaction that doesnot meet such criteria. Even if the post-transaction company owns 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholdersprior to the initial Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post Business Combination company, dependingon valuations ascribed to the target and us in the initial Business Combination. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which weissue a substantial number of new public shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we wouldacquire a 100% interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of Common Stock, ourstockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of Common Stock subsequentto such transaction. In addition, other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person orgroup obtaining a larger share of the company’s stock than we initially acquired. Accordingly, this may make it more likely thatour management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business. We cannot provide assurance that, upon loss of controlof a target business, new management will possess the skills, qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business. We may seek initial Business Combination opportunitieswith a high degree of complexity that require significant operational improvements, which could delay or prevent us from achieving ourdesired results. We may seek initial Business Combinationopportunities with large, highly complex companies that we believe would benefit from operational improvements. While we intend to implementsuch improvements, to the extent that our efforts are delayed or we are unable to achieve the desired improvements, the initial BusinessCombination may not be as successful as we anticipate. To the extent we complete our initialBusiness Combination with a large complex business or entity with a complex operating structure, we may also be affected by numerous risksinherent in the operations of the business with which we combine, which could delay or prevent us from implementing our strategy. Althoughour management team will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business and its operations, we may not be ableto properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors until we complete our initial Business Combination. If we are notable to achieve our desired operational improvements, or the improvements take longer to implement than anticipated, we may not achievethe gains that we anticipate. Furthermore, some of these risks and complexities may be outside of our control and leave us with no abilityto control or reduce the chances that those risks and complexities will adversely impact a target business. Such combination may not beas successful as a combination with a smaller, less complex organization. Risks Relating to Our Securities If we are deemed to be an investment company under theInvestment Company Act, we may be required to comply with burdensome regulatory requirements and our activities may generally be restricted,which may make it difficult to complete an initial Business Combination or force us to abandon our efforts to complete an initial BusinessCombination entirely. If we are deemed to be an investment companyunder the Investment Company Act, we may face restrictions with respect to the nature of investments we may make or hold and with respectto our ability to issue securities, each of which may make it difficult for us to complete an initial Business Combination. In addition,if we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we would expect to be (i) required to register as an investmentcompany, (ii) adopt a a specific form of corporate structure (iii) required to institute certain reporting, record keeping, voting, proxyand disclosure requirements and comply with certain other rules and regulations, each of which may render it impossible for us to consummatean initial Business Combination. 39  In order not to beregulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless it can qualify for an exclusion, a company must ensurethat it is engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities, and that its activities donot include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading “investment securities” constituting more than 40% of thecompany’s assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. The SEC recentlyprovided guidance that the determination of whether a special purpose acquisition company, like the Company, is an “investmentcompany” under the Investment Company Act is a facts and circumstances determination requiring individualized analysis anddepends on a variety of factors, including a SPAC’s duration, asset composition, business purpose and activities, and“is a question of facts and circumstances” requiring individualized analysis. When applying these factors to theCompany, we do not believe that our principal activities presently, or in the future, would require us to register as an investmentcompany under the Investment Company Act, however we cannot guarantee or provide any assurance with respect to an analysis of suchfactors in connection with a review of the Company under the Investment Company Act. Our Company was formed for the purpose ofcompleting an initial Business Combination with one or more businesses. Since our inception, our business has been and will continueto be focused on identifying and completing an initial Business Combination, and thereafter, operating the post-transaction businessor assets for the long term. We also do not plan to buy businesses or assets with a view to resale or profit from their resale, andwe do not plan to buy unrelated businesses or assets or otherwise be a passive investor. In addition, the proceeds held in our TrustAccount were previously invested in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of theInvestment Company Act having a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations until the 24-monthanniversary of our IPO, when, to mitigate the potential risk that we could be deemed to be an investment company under theInvestment Company Act, we instructed the Trustee of our Trust Account to liquidate such investments and to hold such funds in cashor in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts at a national bank. Pursuant to our Investment Management Trust Agreement, theTrustee is not permitted to invest in other securities or assets or in a manner otherwise than we direct. By restricting theinvestment of the proceeds in this manner, and by focusing our directors’ and officers’ time toward operating ourbusiness for the purpose of acquiring and growing businesses for the long term (rather than buying and selling businesses in themanner of a merchant bank or private equity fund or investing in assets for the purpose of achieving investment returns on suchassets), we intend to avoid being deemed an “investment company” within the meaning of the Investment Company Act.Further, investing in our securities is not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government securities orinvestment securities. Instead, the Trust Account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earliest to occur of either:(i) the completion of our initial Business Combination; (ii) the redemption of any Public Shares properly submitted forredemption in connection with a stockholder vote to approve certain amendments to our organizational documents or (iii) absent aninitial Business Combination before the deadline set forth in our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, thereturn of the funds held in the Trust Account to our public stockholders as part of a redemption of the Public Shares in connectionwith our liquidation. If we do not invest the proceeds as discussed above, we may be deemed to be subject to the Investment CompanyAct. If we are deemed to be an investment companyfor purposes of the Investment Company Act, we would need to register as such under the Investment Company Act and compliance with theadditional regulatory burdens associated with such a registration would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted fundsand would likely hinder or render impossible our ability to complete an initial Business Combination, in which case our investors wouldnot be able to realize the benefits of owning shares in a successor operating business, including the potential appreciation in the valueof our securities following such a transaction, and any Public Warrants would expire worthless. 40  We may issue additional Common Stock or preferredstock to complete our initial Business Combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial Business Combination.Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks. Our Fifth Amended andRestated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.0001 pershare, and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. Immediately after the Initial Public Offering, therewere 87,500,000 authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, respectively, available for issuance, which amount does not takeinto account the public shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants. Since the consummation of the InitialPublic Offering, there are no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding. In connection with the Special Meeting and theadoption of our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as of December 18, 2023, shareholders representing 87,380shares of Common Stock redeemed their shares, and as a result, we have 3,051,941 shares of Common Stock currently outstanding. We may issue a substantial numberof additional shares of common or preferred stock to complete our initial Business Combination or under an employee incentive plan aftercompletion of our initial Business Combination (although our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that wemay not issue securities that can vote with Common Stockholders on matters related to our pre-initial Business Combination activity).However, our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides, among other things, that prior to our initial BusinessCombination, we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive funds from theTrust Account or (ii) vote on any initial Business Combination. These provisions of our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporationmay be amended with the approval of the holders of at least 65% of all then outstanding shares of our Common Stock. However, our executiveofficers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our Fifth Amendedand Restated Certificate of Incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to offer redemption rights in connectionwith any proposed initial Business Combination or certain amendments to our charter prior thereto or to redeem 100% of our public sharesif we do not complete our initial Business Combination on or prior to July 19, 2024 (or such earlier applicable date if we opt not tocontinue to exercise our remaining Monthly Extension Options), or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their sharesof Common Stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on depositin the Trust Account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding publicshares. The issuance of additional shares of common or preferredstock: ●may significantly dilute the equity interest of investorsin this Company ●may subordinate the rights of holders of Common Stock ifpreferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our Common Stock; ●could cause a change of control if a substantial number ofshares of our Common Stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards,if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and ●may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Units,public shares and/or Warrants. An investment in this Company may result in uncertainor adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. An investment in this Company mayresult in uncertain or adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences. For instance, because there are no authorities that directly addressinstruments similar to the Units we issued in the Initial Public Offering, the allocation an investor makes with respect to the purchaseprice of a Unit between the public share and the redeemable Warrant included in each Unit could be challenged by the Internal RevenueService (“IRS”) or the courts. In addition, if we are determined to be a personal holding company for U.S. federal incometax purposes, our taxable income would be subjected to an additional 20% federal income tax, which would reduce the net after-tax amountof interest income earned on the funds placed in our Trust Account. Furthermore, the U.S. federal income tax consequences of a cashlessexercise of warrants included in the Units we issued in the Initial Public Offering and of a redemption of warrants for public sharesare unclear under current law. Finally, it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to our shares suspend the running ofa U.S. holder’s holding period for purposes of determining whether any gain or loss realized by such holder on the sale or exchangeof public shares is long-term capital gain or loss and for purposes of determining whether any dividend we pay would be considered “qualifieddividends” for federal income tax purposes. Prospective investors are urged to consult their tax advisors with respect to theseand other tax consequences when purchasing, holding or disposing of our securities. 41   The funds held in our Trust Account, which are currentlyinvested in cash or interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, could potentially bear a negative rate of interest, which could reduce thevalue of the assets held in trust such that the per-share redemption amount received by our public stockholders may be less than $10.15per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering). Following the consummation of ourIPO, certain proceeds of our IPO and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants to our Sponsor were held in the Trust Account and investedin U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions underRule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act, which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Subsequent to the 24-monthanniversary of our IPO, such funds have been held in cash or in interest-bearing demand deposit accounts at a national bank. Such depositaccounts carry a variable interest rate, which in certain circumstances may be negative. Negative interest rates could reduce the valueof the assets held in our Trust Account such that the per-share redemption amount received by our public stockholders may be less than$10.15 per share (the amount originally deposited in our Trust Account upon the consummation of our IPO). We have agreed to register the shares of CommonStock underlying the public warrants under the Securities Act; however, we cannot assure you that such registration will be in place whenan investor desires to exercise warrants, thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants except on a cashlessbasis and potentially causing such warrants to expire worthless. Under the terms of the warrant agreement,we have agreed that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than 15 business days after the closing of our initial Business Combination,we will use our best efforts to file with the SEC a registration statement for the registration under the Securities Act of the offerand sale of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and thereafter will use our best efforts to cause the sameto become effective within 60 business days following our initial Business Combination and to maintain a current prospectus relating tothe shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants, until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrantagreement. We cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if, for example, any facts or events arise which represent a fundamentalchange in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus, the financial statements contained or incorporated byreference therein are not current or correct or the SEC issues a stop order. If the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants arenot registered under the Securities Act, we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. However,no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis, and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking toexercise their warrants, unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws ofthe state of the exercising holder, or an exemption from registration is available. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registration statementcovering the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummation of ourinitial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any periodwhen we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to the exemptionprovided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available. If that exemption, or another exemption,is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. We will use our best efforts to register orqualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available. In no event will we be required to netcash settle any warrant, or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to registeror qualify the shares underlying the warrants under applicable state securities laws and there is no exemption available. If the issuanceof the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification, the holderof such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless. In such event,holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of Units will have paid the full Unit purchase price solely for the public sharesincluded in the Units. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance of sharesof Common Stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue sky laws orwe are unable to effect such registration or qualification. There may be a circumstance where an exemption from registration exists forholders of our Private Placement Warrants to exercise their warrants while a corresponding exemption does not exist for holders of thewarrants included as part of Units sold in the Initial Public Offering. In such an instance, our Sponsor and its transferees (which mayinclude our directors and executive officers) would be able to sell the Common Stock underlying their warrants while holders of our publicwarrants would not be able to exercise their warrants and sell the underlying Common Stock. We will use our best efforts to register orqualify such shares of Common Stock under the applicable blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrantswere offered by us in the Initial Public Offering. However, there may be instances in which holders of our public warrants may be unableto exercise such public warrants but holders of our Private Placement Warrants may be able to exercise such Private Placement Warrants. 42  If a warrant holder exercises their public warrants on a “cashlessbasis,” they will receive fewer public shares from such exercise than if they were to exercise such warrants for cash. There are circumstances in whichthe exercise of the public warrants may be required or permitted to be made on a cashless basis. First, if a registration statement coveringthe shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective by the 60th business day afterthe closing of our initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement,exercise warrants on a cashless basis in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act or another exemption. Second, if a registrationstatement covering the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants is not effective within a specified period following the consummationof our initial Business Combination, warrant holders may, until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during anyperiod when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement, exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to theexemption provided by Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act, provided that such exemption is available; if that exemption, or anotherexemption, is not available, holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis. Third, if we call the public warrantsfor redemption, our management will have the option to require all holders that wish to exercise warrants to do so on a cashless basis.In the event of an exercise on a cashless basis, a holder would pay the warrant exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that numberof shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product of the number of shares underlying the warrants, multiplied by thedifference between the exercise price of the warrants and the “fair market value” (as defined in the warrant agreement enteredinto in connection with our Initial Public Offering between the Trustee and the Company, dated October 14, 2021, and included as an exhibitto this Annual Report). We may amend the terms of the warrants in a mannerthat may be adverse to holders of public warrants with the approval by the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding publicwarrants. As a result, the exercise price of a warrant holders warrants could be increased, the exercise period could be shortened andthe number of our public shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant could be decreased, all without such warrant holder’s approval. Our warrants were issued in registeredform under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, LLC , as warrant agent, and us. The warrant agreementprovides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any mistake,including to conform the provisions of the warrant agreement to the description of the terms of the warrants and the warrant agreementdated October 14, 2021, or to correct any defective provision, but requires the approval by the holders of at least a majority of thethen outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants.Accordingly, we may amend the terms of the public warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least a majority of the thenoutstanding public warrants approve of such amendment. Although our ability to amend the terms of the public warrants with the consentof at least a majority of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited, examples of such amendments could be amendments to, amongother things, increase the exercise price of the warrants, convert the warrants into cash or stock, shorten the exercise period or decreasethe number of our public shares purchasable upon exercise of a warrant. Because each warrant contains three quarters ofone share, the Units may be worth less than units of other blank check companies. Each Unit contains one redeemablewarrant exercisable for three quarters of one share of Common Stock. No fractional shares will be issued. This is different from otherinitial public offerings which included one public share and one warrant to purchase one whole share. We established the components ofthe Units in this way in order to reduce the dilutive effect of the warrants upon completion of an initial Business Combination sincethe warrants will be exercisable in the aggregate for three quarters of the number of shares compared to units that each contain a warrantto purchase one whole share, thus making us, we believe, a more attractive merger partner for target businesses. Nevertheless, this unitstructure may cause our Units to be worth less than if they included a warrant to purchase one whole share. 43  Our warrant agreement designates the courtsof the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York as the sole and exclusive forum forcertain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by holders of our warrants, which could limit the ability of warrant holdersto obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with our company. Our warrant agreement providesthat, subject to applicable law, (i) any action, proceeding or claim against us arising out of or relating in any way to the warrant agreement,including under the Securities Act, will be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of New York, and (ii) that we irrevocably submit to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be theexclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim. We will waive any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courtsrepresent an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, theseprovisions of the warrant agreement will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act orany other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any personor entity who purchases or otherwise acquires any interest in any of our warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to haveconsented to the forum provisions in our warrant agreement. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forumprovisions of the warrant agreement, is filed in a court other than a court of the State of New York or the United States DistrictCourt for the Southern District of New York, or a foreign action, in the name of any holder of our warrants, such holder shall bedeemed to have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in the State of New York inconnection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions, or an enforcement action, and (y) havingservice of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement action by service upon such warrant holder’s counselin such action as agent for the foreign warrant holder. The choice-of-forum provision in our warrantagreement may (1) result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim or (2) limit a warrant holder’s ability to bring aclaim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with our company, which may discourage such lawsuits. Alternatively,if a court were to find this provision of our warrant agreement inapplicable or unenforceable with respect to one or more of thespecified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in otherjurisdictions, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and result ina diversion of the time and resources of our management and board of directors. We note that there is uncertainty as to whether acourt would enforce this provision and that investors cannot waive compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules andregulations thereunder. Section 22 of the Securities Actcreates concurrent jurisdiction for state and federal courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the SecuritiesAct or the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits broughtto enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Provisions in our Fifth Amended and RestatedCertificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers. Our Fifth Amended and RestatedCertificate of Incorporation requires, subject to certain exceptions, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternativeforum, the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (b) any action asserting a claimof breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director, officer, employee, agent to us or our stockholders, (c) any actionasserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, the Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws,or (d) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine shall be the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware(or, if the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction over such action or proceeding, then another court of the Stateof Delaware or, if no court of the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, then the United States District Court for the District of Delaware).Although we believe this forum provision benefits us by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the typesof lawsuits to which it applies, a court may determine that this provision is unenforceable, and to the extent it is enforceable, theprovision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers, although our stockholders will not be deemedto have waived our compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Further, if any action, the subjectmatter of which is within the scope the forum provisions of our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, is filed in acourt other than a court of the State of Delaware, such action we refer to as a foreign action, in the name of any stockholder, such stockholdershall be deemed to have consented to (i) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of Delawarein connection with any action brought in such court to enforce the forum provisions, such action we refer to as an enforcement action,and (ii) having service of process made upon such stockholder in any such enforcement action by service upon such stockholder’scounsel in the foreign action as agent for such stockholder. In addition, our Fifth Amendedand Restated Certificate of Incorporation states that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federaldistrict courts of the United States of America shall be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause ofaction arising under the Securities Act. Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courtsover all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. 44  However, our Fifth Amended andRestated Certificate of Incorporation does not purport to require suits brought to enforce a duty or liability created by the ExchangeAct to be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or another court of the State of Delaware. Section 27 of the ExchangeAct creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all claims brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or therules and regulations thereunder. We may redeem unexpired warrants prior to theirexercise at a time that is disadvantageous to a warrant holder, thereby making the warrants worthless. We have the ability to redeemoutstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration, at a price of $0.01 per warrant, providedthat the last reported sales price of our public shares equals or exceeds $16.50 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like) for any 20 trading days within a 30 trading-day period commencing once the warrants becomeexercisable and ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which we give proper notice of such redemption and provided certainother conditions are met. If and when the warrants become redeemable by us, we may not exercise our redemption right if the issuance ofshares of Common Stock upon exercise of the warrants is not exempt from registration or qualification under applicable state blue skylaws or we are unable to effect such registration or qualification. We will use our best efforts to register or qualify such shares ofCommon Stock under the blue sky laws of the state of residence in those states in which the warrants were offered by us in the InitialPublic Offering. Redemption of the outstanding warrants could force warrant holders (i) to exercise their warrants and pay the exerciseprice therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for them to do so, (ii) to sell warrants at the then- current market price whenthe warrant holder might otherwise wish to hold their warrants or (iii) to accept the nominal redemption price which, at the time theoutstanding warrants are called for redemption, is likely to be substantially less than the market value of the warrants. None of thePrivate Placement Warrants are redeemable by us so long as they are held by the Sponsor or its permitted transferees. Our warrants and Founder Shares may have anadverse effect on the market price of our public shares and make it more difficult to effectuate our initial Business Combination. We issued warrants to purchase7,500,000 shares as part of the Units offered in our Initial Public Offering and, simultaneously with the closing of the Initial PublicOffering, we issued Private Placement Warrants to purchase an aggregate of 5,350,000 shares at $11.50 per share. Our initial stockholderscurrently own an aggregate of 2,500,000 Founder Shares. In addition, if our Sponsor makes any working capital loans, up to $1,500,000of such loans may be converted into warrants, at the price of $0.75 per warrant at the option of the lender. Such warrants would be identicalto the Private Placement Warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. To the extent we issue public sharesto effectuate an initial Business Combination, the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional public shares uponexercise of these warrants and conversion rights could make us a less attractive Business Combination vehicle to a target business. Anysuch issuance will increase the number of issued and outstanding public shares and reduce the value of the shares issued to complete theinitial Business Combination. Therefore, our warrants and Founder Shares may make it more difficult to effectuate an initial BusinessCombination or increase the cost of acquiring the target business. The Private Placement Warrants areidentical to the warrants sold as part of the Units in the Initial Public Offering except that, so long as they are held by our Sponsoror its permitted transferees, (i) they will not be redeemable by us, (ii) they (including the shares issuable upon exercise of these warrants)may not, subject to certain limited exceptions, be transferred, assigned or sold by our Sponsor until 30 days after the completion ofour initial Business Combination and (iii) they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis. A provision of our warrant agreement may make it moredifficult for us to consummate an initial Business Combination. Unlike most blank check companies, if (i)we issue additional shares or equity-linked securities forcapital raising purposes in connection with the closing of our initial Business Combination at a Newly Issued Price (as defined in thewarrant agreement) of less than $9.50 per share, (ii)the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances representmore than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and interest thereon, available for the funding of our initial Business Combination on thedate of the consummation of our initial Business Combination (net of redemptions), and (iii)the Market Value (as defined in the warrant agreement) isbelow $9.50 per share, then the exercise price of the warrants will be adjusted to beequal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price, and the $16.50 per share redemption trigger price willbe adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 165% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price. This may make itmore difficult for us to consummate an initial Business Combination with a target business. 45  The grant of registration rights to our initialstockholders may make it more difficult to complete our initial Business Combination, and the future exercise of such rights may adverselyaffect the market price of our public shares. Pursuant to a registration rightsagreement entered into with our initial stockholders on October 14, 2021, our initial stockholders and their permitted transferees candemand that we register the Private Placement Warrants, the shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants held, or tobe held, by them and holders of warrants that may be issued upon conversion of working capital loans may demand that we register suchwarrants or the shares issuable upon exercise of such warrants. We will bear the cost of registering these securities. The registrationand availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the marketprice of our public shares. In addition, the existence of the registration rights may make our initial Business Combination more costlyor difficult to conclude. This is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combinedentity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our public shares that is expected whenthe securities owned by our initial stockholders or holders of working capital loans or their respective permitted transferees are registered. A market for our securities may not be sustained,which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities. The price of our securities mayvary significantly due to one or more potential Business Combinations and general market or economic conditions. Furthermore, an activetrading market for our securities may not be sustained. Security holders may be unable to sell their securities unless a market can besustained. Provisions in our Fifth Amended and RestatedCertificate of Incorporation and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing topay in the future for our public shares and could entrench management. Our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificateof Incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in theirbest interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the termsof and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions thatotherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities. Section 203 of the DGCL affects theability of an “interested stockholder” to engage in certain Business Combinations for a period of three years following thetime that the stockholder becomes an “interested stockholder.” We elect in our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporationnot to be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL. Nevertheless, our Fifth Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation contains provisionsthat have the same effect as Section 203 of the DGCL, except that it provides that affiliates of our Sponsor and their transferees willnot be deemed to be “interested stockholders,” regardless of the percentage of our voting stock owned by them, and will thereforenot be subject to such restrictions. These charter provisions may limit the ability of third parties to acquire control of our company. Risks Relating to the CannabisIndustry Business Combinations with companies operatingin the cannabis industry entail special considerations and risks. If we complete a Business Combination with a target business in thecannabis industry, we will be subject to, and possibly adversely affected by, the risks set forth below. However, our efforts in identifying prospective targetbusinesses are not limited to the cannabis industry. Accordingly, if we acquire a target business in another industry, these risks willlikely not affect us and we will be subject to other risks attendant with the specific industry of the target business which we acquire,none of which can be presently ascertained. There are risks related to the cannabis industry to whichwe may become subject. If we are successful in completinga Business Combination with a target business with operations in the cannabis industry, we will be subject to, and possibly adverselyaffected by, the following risks: ●The cannabis industry is extremely speculative and its legalityis uncertain, making it subject to inherent risk; ●Use, cultivation, manufacturing, processing, transportation,distribution, storage and/or sale of cannabis (other than hemp) that is not in compliance with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act isillegal under U.S. federal law, and therefore, strict enforcement of U.S. federal laws regarding such activities would likely resultin our inability to execute a business plan in the cannabis industry; 46  ●Policies that may be established or revised by the BidenAdministration and the U.S. Department of Justice resulting in heightened enforcement of U.S. federal cannabis laws may negatively impactour ability to pursue our prospective business operations and/or generate revenues; ●U.S. federal courts may refuse to recognize the enforceabilityof contracts pertaining to any business operations that are deemed illegal under U.S. federal law and, as a result, cannabis-relatedcontracts could prove unenforceable in such courts; ●Consumer complaints and negative publicity regarding cannabis-relatedproducts and services could lead to political pressure on states to implement new laws and regulations that are adverse to the cannabisindustry; to not modify existing, restrictive laws and regulations; or to reverse currently favorable laws and regulations relating tocannabis; ●Assets leased to cannabis businesses may be forfeited tothe U.S. federal government in connection with government enforcement actions under U.S. federal law; ●The potential regulation of cannabis by U.S. federal agencies,including the Food and Drug Administration and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, including the possible registrationof facilities where cannabis is grown, could negatively affect the cannabis industry, which could directly affect our financial condition; ●Due to our proposed involvement in the regulated cannabisindustry, we may have a difficult time obtaining the various insurance policies that are needed to operate our business, which may exposeus to additional risks and financial liabilities; ●The cannabis industry may face significant opposition fromother industries that perceive cannabis products and services as competitive with their own, including, but not limited, to the pharmaceuticalindustry, adult beverage industry, and the tobacco industry, all of which have powerful lobbying and financial resources; ●Many national and regional banks have been resistant to doing,or have refused to do, business with cannabis companies because of the uncertainties and prohibitions presented by federal law. As such,we may have difficulty accessing the service of banks and similar depositary institutions, which may inhibit our ability to open bankaccounts or otherwise utilize traditional banking services; ●Many investors, lenders, and other financial institutions have been resistant to doing, or have refusedto do, business with cannabis companies because of the uncertainties and prohibitions presented by federal law. As such, we may have adifficult time obtaining financing in connection with our initial Business Combination or thereafter; ●Laws and regulations affecting the regulated cannabis industry are varied, broad in scope, and subjectto evolving interpretations, and may restrict the use of the assets or properties we acquire, or require certain additional regulatoryapprovals, any of which could materially adversely affect our operations; ●U.S. national securities exchanges may not list companies engaged in the cannabis industry, and U.S.securities clearing firms may not clear trades of the publicly traded securities of companies engaged in the cannabis industry, potentiallylimiting our ability to efficiently access capital markets; ●Section 280E of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which substantiallydisallows a tax deduction for any amount paid or incurred in carrying on any trade or business that consists of trafficking in controlledsubstances prohibited by federal or state law, may prevent us from deducting certain business expenditures, which would increase our nettaxable income; and ●Risks similar to those discussed above based on regulations of other jurisdictions in which a prospectivetarget may operate or be organized. Any of the foregoing could have an adverse impact on ouroperations following a Business Combination. Cannabis is currently illegal under U.S. federallaw and in other jurisdictions. If we complete a Business Combinationwith a target in the cannabis industry, our ability to achieve our business objectives will be contingent, in part, upon the legalityof the cannabis industry, our compliance with regulatory requirements enacted by various governmental authorities, and our obtaining allregulatory approvals, where necessary. Although hemp (a specific form of cannabis) and hemp-derived cannabinoids are no longer considereda controlled substance under U.S. federal law, as a result of the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, as amended (the “Farm Bill”),cannabis otherwise remains a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States and is currently illegal under U.S. federal law. Evenin those U.S. states in which the adult use of cannabis has been legalized, its use, possession, cultivation, manufacturing, and distributionremains a violation of U.S. federal law. Since U.S. federal laws criminalizing the use of cannabis preempt state laws that legalize itsuse, continuation of U.S. federal law in its current state regarding cannabis could limit our ability to do business in the United Statesif we complete such a transaction. Similar issues of illegality apply in other countries. 47  We only intend to target companiesthat are compliant with all applicable state, commonwealth, and municipal laws and regulations within the jurisdictions in which theyare located or operate and, in particular, we will not invest in, or consummate a Business Combination with, a target business that wedetermine has been operating, or whose business plan is to operate, in violation of the U.S. Controlled Substances Act. A cannabis industrybusiness will be subject to a variety of laws, regulations, and guidelines relating to cannabis, as well as laws and regulations relatingto health and safety, the conduct of operations and the protection of the environment. Changes to such laws, regulations, and guidelines,as well as the enforcement thereof, may cause adverse effects on our ability to identify and acquire a target company that meets theselegal and regulatory requirements at the time of acquisition. The laws and regulations governingcannabis are still developing, including in ways that we may not foresee. Any amendment to or replacement of existing laws to make themmore onerous, or delays in amending or replacing existing laws to liberalize the legal possession and use of cannabis, or delays in obtaining,or the failure to obtain, any necessary regulatory approvals, may significantly delay or impact negatively our ability to consummate aninitial Business Combination, the markets in which we operate, products, and sales initiatives, and could have a material adverse effecton our business, liquidity, financial condition, and/or results of operations. The approach to the enforcement of cannabis lawsmay be subject to change or may not proceed as previously outlined. As a result of the conflicting views betweenstate legislatures and the federal government regarding cannabis, investments in cannabis businesses in the United States are subjectto inconsistent regulation and enforcement policies. A response to this inconsistency was addressed in August 2013 when then Deputy U.S.Attorney General James Cole authored a memorandum (the “Cole Memorandum”) addressed to all United States district attorneysacknowledging that, notwithstanding the designation of cannabis as a controlled substance at the federal level in the United States, severalU.S. states have enacted laws relating to cannabis for medical purposes. The Cole Memorandum outlined certain priorities for the Departmentof Justice relating to the prosecution of cannabis offenses, primarily that the Department of Justice should be focused on addressingonly the most significant threats related to cannabis, and that states where medical cannabis had been legalized were not characterizedas a high priority. In March 2017, Attorney GeneralJeff Sessions noted limited federal resources and acknowledged that much of the Cole Memorandum had merit; however, he disagreed thatit had been implemented effectively and, on January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions authored a memorandum (the “SessionsMemorandum”), which rescinded the Cole Memorandum. As a result of the Sessions Memorandum, federal prosecutors are no longer specificallyguided with respect to prosecutorial discretion to decide whether to prosecute cannabis activities, despite the existence of state-levellaws that may be inconsistent with federal prohibitions. On January 21, 2021, Joseph Biden, Jr. was sworn in as President of the UnitedStates. President Biden’s Attorney General, Merrick Garland, was confirmed by the United States Senate on March 10, 2021. It isnot yet known whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum orannounce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy. Unless and until the United States Congress amends the Controlled Substances Actwith respect to cannabis (and as to the timing or scope of any such potential amendments there can be no assurance), there is a risk thatfederal authorities may enforce current U.S. federal law. Currently, in the absence of uniform federal guidance, as had been establishedby the Cole Memorandum, enforcement priorities are determined by respective United States Attorneys. Additionally, the Rohrbacher-FarrAmendment (the “Amendment”) has been adopted by Congress in successive budgets since 2015. The Amendment prohibits the Departmentof Justice from spending funds appropriated by Congress to enforce the tenets of the Controlled Substances Act against the medical cannabisindustry in states that have legalized such activity. This Amendment has historically been passed as an amendment to omnibus appropriationsbills, which by their nature expire at the end of a fiscal year or other defined term. The Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment (now known colloquiallyas the “Joyce-Leahy Amendment” after its most recent sponsors) was included in the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021,which was enacted into law on December 21, 2020, and funds the departments of the federal government through the fiscal year ending September2021. There is no assurance that such limitations will remain in place or be renewed in the future. Violations of any U.S. federallaws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions or settlements arising from civilproceedings conducted by either the U.S. federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgementof profits, cessation of business activities, or divestiture. Any proceedings to enforce such laws could have a material adverse effecton an issuer’s business, revenues, operating results and financial condition as well as the issuer’s reputation, even if suchproceedings were concluded successfully in favor of the issuer. In the extreme case, such proceedings could ultimately involve the prosecutionof key executives of the issuer or the seizure of corporate assets. Any investments or acquisitions in the United Statesmay be subject to applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations. If we were to acquire or investin a U.S. cannabis industry business, we would be subject to a variety of laws and regulations domestically and in the United States thatinvolve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the Currency and Foreign Transactions ReportingAct of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended by Title III of the Uniting and Strengthening America by ProvidingAppropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (USA PATRIOT Act), and any related or similar rules, regulationsor guidelines issued, administered or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States. 48  In February 2014, the FinancialCrimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury issued a memorandum providing instructions to banks seeking to provideservices to cannabis-related businesses (the “FinCEN Memo”). The FinCEN Memo states that, in some circumstances, it is permissiblefor banks to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of U.S. federal money launderinglaws. It is unclear at this time whether the current administration will follow the guidelines of the FinCEN Memo. In the event that the Company’sinvestments, or any proceeds thereof, any dividends or distributions therefrom, or any profits or revenues accruing from such investmentsin the United States were found to be in violation of money laundering legislation or otherwise, such transactions may be viewed as proceedsof crime under one or more of the statutes noted above or any other applicable legislation. Violations of any U.S. federal laws and regulationscould result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions, or settlements arising from civil proceedings conductedby either the U.S. federal government or private citizens, or criminal charges, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits,cessation of business activities, or divestiture. Any potential growth in the cannabis industry continuesto be subject to new and changing state and local laws and regulations. Continued development of the U.S.cannabis industry is dependent upon continued legislative legalization of cannabis at the state, commonwealth, and local levels, and anumber of factors could slow or halt progress in this area, even where there is public support for legislative action. Any delay or haltin the passing or implementation of legislation legalizing cannabis use, or its cultivation, manufacturing, processing, transportation,distribution, storage, and/or sale, or the re-criminalization or restriction of cannabis at the state, commonwealth, and/or local levelscould negatively impact our business. Additionally, changes in applicable state, commonwealth, and local laws or regulations, includingzoning restrictions, permitting requirements, and fees, could restrict the products and services we may offer, or impose additional compliancecosts on us or our customers. Violations of applicable laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and resultin a material adverse effect on our operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications,and it is possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be materially adverse to our business. We may operate a highly-regulated businessand any failure or significant delay in obtaining regulatory approvals could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. Achievement of our business objectiveswill be contingent, in part, upon compliance with the regulatory requirements enacted by applicable government authorities and obtainingall regulatory approvals, where necessary, for the sale of our products. We cannot predict the time required to secure all appropriateregulatory approvals for our products, additional restrictions that may be placed on our business, or the extent of testing and documentationthat may be required by government authorities result from cannabis-specific laws and regulations. Any delays in obtaining, or failureto obtain, regulatory approvals would significantly delay the development of markets and products and could have a material adverse effecton our business, results of operation, and financial condition. To the extent we acquire cannabis businesses orassets in the United States in connection with our initial Business Combination, there may be a restriction on the deduction of certainexpenses. Section 280E of the United StatesTax Code generally prohibits businesses from deducting or claiming tax credits with respect to expenses paid or incurred in carrying onany trade or business if such trade or business (or the activities which comprise such trade or business) consists of trafficking in controlledsubstances (within the meaning of Schedule I and II of the U.S. Controlled Substance Act of 1970, as amended) which is prohibited by U.S.federal law or the law of any state in which such trade or business is conducted. Code Section 280E currently applies to businesses operatingin the cannabis industry, irrespective of whether such businesses are licensed and operating in accordance with applicable state laws.The application of Code Section 280E generally causes such businesses to pay higher effective U.S. federal tax rates than similar businessesin other industries. The impact of Code Section 280E on the effective tax rate of a cannabis business generally depends on how large theratio of non-deductible expenses is to the business’ total revenues. The IRS has not yet provided guidance on whether an ancillarycannabis business is considered to be trafficking in controlled substances and therefore subject to Code Section 280E. The applicationof Code Section 280E to any business that we may acquire as part of our initial Business Combination, if any, may adversely affect ourprofitability and, in fact, may cause us to operate at a loss. To the extent we acquire cannabis businesses orassets, there may be a lack of access to U.S. bankruptcy protections. Because cannabis is illegal underU.S. federal law, many courts have denied businesses operating in or with the cannabis industry protections under the U.S. federal bankruptcycode. If a company we acquire as part of our initial Business Combination were to experience a bankruptcy or insolvency, although certainremedies may be available under state law, there is no guarantee that U.S. federal bankruptcy protections would be available, which couldhave a material adverse effect on the financial condition and prospects of such business and on the rights of its lenders and securityholders. 49  U.S. regulations relating to hemp and hemp-derivedCBD products are unclear and rapidly evolving. We may acquire a business involvedin the production, distribution, or sale of hemp and/or hemp-derived CBD products. Participation in the market for hemp-derived CBD productsin the United States and elsewhere may require us to employ novel approaches to existing regulatory pathways. Although the passage ofthe Farm Bill in December 2018 legalized the possession, cultivation, manufacture, and sale of hemp in the United States, allowing forthe production of products containing hemp, CBD and other non-THC-derived cannabinoids, the FDA currently does not allow for the introductioninto interstate commerce of foods, beverages, or dietary supplements containing hemp-derived CBD. If we acquire such a target business,it is unclear how the FDA would respond to the approach taken by such business, or whether the FDA will propose or implement new or additionalregulations regarding such products. In addition, such products may be subject to regulation at the state, commonwealth, or local levels.Unforeseen regulatory obstacles may hinder our ability to successfully compete in the market for such products. We may become involved in regulatory or agency proceedings,investigations, and audits. Businesses in the cannabis industry,and the business of the suppliers from which we may acquire the products we may sell, require compliance with many laws and regulations.Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us or such suppliers to regulatory or agency proceedings or investigations,and could also lead to damage awards, fines, and penalties. We or such suppliers may become involved in a number of government or agencyproceedings, investigations, and audits. The outcome of any regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations, audits, and other contingenciescould harm our reputation or the reputations of the products and brands that we may sell, require us to take, or refrain from taking,actions that could harm our operations, or require us to pay substantial amounts of money, harming our financial condition. There canbe no assurance that any pending or future regulatory or agency proceedings, investigations, and audits will not result in substantialcosts or a diversion of management’s attention and resources, or have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition,and results of operations. The cannabis industry is highly competitive and evolving. The market for businesses in thecannabis industry is highly competitive and evolving. There may be no material aspect of our business that is protected by patents, copyrights,trademarks, trade names, or trade secrets laws, and we may face strong competition from larger companies, including in our search foran initial Business Combination and those that may offer similar products and services to ours following our initial Business Combination.Our potential competitors may have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, marketing or other resources, and largerclient bases than we will, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully compete against these or other competitors.Additionally, because the cannabis industry is at an early stage, a potential target cannabis company may face additional competitionfrom new entrants. To remain competitive, a target businessmay require a continued high level of investment in research and development, marketing, sales, and client support. However, a potentialtarget business may not have sufficient resources to maintain research and development, marketing, sales, and client support efforts ona competitive basis, which could materially and adversely affect the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the company.Additionally, as new technologies related to the cultivation, processing, manufacturing, and research and development of cannabis arebeing explored, there is potential for third party competitors to be in possession of superior technology that would reduce any relativecompetitiveness a potential business target may have. As the legal landscape for cannabiscontinues to evolve, it is possible that the cannabis industry will undergo consolidation, creating larger companies with greater financialresources, manufacturing, marketing capabilities, and product offerings. Given the rapid changes affecting the global, national, and regionaleconomies, generally, and the cannabis industry, in particular, we may not be able to create and maintain a competitive advantage in themarketplace. Our success will depend on our ability to keep pace with any changes in our markets, particularly, legal and regulatory changes.For example, it is likely that we, and our competitors, will seek to introduce new products in the future. Our success will also dependon our ability to respond to, among other things, changes in the economy, market conditions, and competitive pressures. Any failure byus to anticipate or respond adequately to such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results ofoperations. We and our customers may have difficulty accessingthe service of banks, which may make it difficult to sell products and services. Financial transactions involvingproceeds generated by cannabis-related conduct can form the basis for prosecution under federal money laundering statutes, unlicensedmoney transmitter statutes, and the U.S. Bank Secrecy Act. The FinCEN Memo clarifies how financial institutions may provide services tocannabis-related businesses consistent with their obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Despite the rescission of memoranda that hadde-prioritized the enforcement of federal law against individuals and entities that use, possession, manufacture, or distribute cannabis,who are otherwise compliant with laws of states that permit such activities, FinCEN has not rescinded the FinCEN Memo. While this memoappears to be a standalone document and is presumptively still in effect, FinCEN could elect to rescind the FinCEN Memo at any time. Federallychartered banks and many other depositary institutions remain hesitant to, or refuse to, offer banking services to cannabis-related businesses.Consequently, those businesses involved in the cannabis industry continue to encounter difficulty establishing banking relationships.Although U.S. federal legislation is pending to permit access by cannabis industry operators to depositary institutions, through the Secureand Fair Enforcement Banking Act of 2021, there can be no assurance that any such legislation will be enacted into law. Our inabilityto maintain bank accounts would make it difficult for us to operate our business, increase our operating costs, and pose additional operational,logistical, and security challenges, and could result in our inability to implement our business plan. 50  The development and operation of businessesin the cannabis industry may require additional financing, which may not be available on favorable terms, if at all. Due to the growth in the cannabisindustry, the continued development and operation of businesses in the cannabis industry may require additional financing. Due to thefact that cannabis remains illegal under U.S. federal law, many investors, lenders, and financial institutions are hesitant to, or refuseto, do business with cannabis-related businesses. The failure to raise such capital could result in the delay or indefinite postponementof current business objectives or the cessation of business. There can be no assurance that additional capital or other types of financingwill be available if needed or that, if available, the terms of such financing will be favorable. Third parties with which we do business mayperceive themselves as being exposed to reputational risk by virtue of their relationship with us and may ultimately elect not to do businesswith us. If we acquire a target businessin the cannabis industry, the parties with which we do business may perceive that they are exposed to reputational risk as a result ofour cannabis business activities. Failure to establish or maintain business relationships could have a material adverse effect on us. Certain events or developments in the cannabis industrymore generally may impact our reputation. Damage to our reputation can resultfrom the actual or perceived occurrence of any number of events, including any negative publicity, whether true or not. If we acquirea target business in the cannabis industry, because cannabis has been historically and commonly associated with various other narcotics,violence and criminal activities, there is a risk that our business might attract negative publicity. There is also a risk that the actionsof other companies and service providers and customers in the cannabis industry may negatively affect the reputation of the industry asa whole and thereby negatively impact our reputation. The increased usage of social media and other web-based tools used to generate,publish, and discuss user-generated content and to connect with other users has made it increasingly easier for individuals and groupsto communicate and share negative opinions and views in regards to our activities and the cannabis industry in general, whether true ornot. We do not ultimately have direct control over how we or the cannabis industry are perceived by others. Reputational issues may resultin decreased investor confidence, increased challenges in developing and maintaining community relations and present an impediment toour overall ability to advance our business strategy and realize on our growth prospects. General Risk Factors
 We have no revenues, and security holders have nobasis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective. We have no revenues and thereis no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial Business Combination withone or more target businesses. Except with respect to the Vaso Business Combination, we have no plans, arrangements or understandingswith any prospective target business concerning an initial Business Combination and may be unable to complete our initial Business Combination.If we fail to complete our initial Business Combination, we will never generate any operating revenues. Changes in laws or regulations, or a failure tocomply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our investments, business, including our ability to negotiate and completeour initial Business Combination, and results of operations. We are subject to laws and regulationsenacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements.Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulationsand their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpretedand applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to negotiate and complete our initial BusinessCombination, and results of operations. For example, on January 24, 2024, the SEC issued final rules and guidance relating to specialpurpose acquisition companies, like us, regarding, among other things, disclosure in SEC filings in connection with initial business combinationtransactions; the financial statement requirements applicable to transactions involving shell companies; the use of projectionsin SEC filings in connection with a proposed business combination transaction; and the potential liability of certain participantsin proposed business combination transactions. This continually evolving regulatory environment may result in continuing uncertainty regardingcompliance matters and additional costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to the Company’s disclosure and governance practices.A failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations and any subsequent changes, as interpreted and applied, could have a materialadverse effect on the Company’s business, including its ability to negotiate and complete an initial Business Combination, and ourresults of operations. 51  A new 1% U.S. federal excise tax may be imposedin connection with redemptions of our shares. On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Actof 2022 (the “IRA”) was signed into federal law. The IRA provides for, among other things, a new U.S. federal 1% excise taxon certain repurchases (including redemptions) of stock by publicly traded domestic (i.e., U.S.) corporations and certain domestic subsidiariesof publicly traded foreign corporations. The excise tax is imposed on the repurchasing corporation itself, not its stockholders fromwhich shares are repurchased. The amount of the excise tax is generally 1% of the fair market value of the shares repurchased at thetime of the repurchase. However, for purposes of calculating the excise tax, repurchasing corporations are permitted to net the fairmarket value of certain new stock issuances against the fair market value of stock repurchases during the same taxable year. In addition,certain exceptions apply to the excise tax. The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) has been given authorityto provide regulations and other guidance to carry out and prevent the abuse or avoidance of the excise tax. The IRS and the Treasuryhave issued a notice of an intention to issue proposed regulations (the “Notice”); the Notice also provides interim guidanceon which taxpayers can rely until issuance of the proposed regulations. The IRA excise tax applies onlyto repurchases that occur after December 31, 2022. In the absence of definitive guidance, it is uncertain whether, and/or to what extent,the excise tax could apply to any redemptions of our Public Shares after December 31, 2022, including any redemptions in connection withan initial Business Combination or extension requests, or exchanges of stock pursuant to an acquisitive reorganization (i.e., pursuantto an initial Business Combination or otherwise). Nevertheless, under the Notice, it appears that distributions pursuant to a completeliquidation of the Company (e.g., in the event we do not consummate an initial Business Combination) generally are not subject to this1% excise tax, and other redemptions or repurchases of stock made during the same taxable year as the taxable year the Company completelyliquidates and dissolves also would be exempt. However, in the absence of definitive guidance, it is possible that any redemption or otherrepurchase that occurs after December 31, 2022, in connection with an initial Business Combination, extension request or otherwise maybe subject to the excise tax. Whether and to what extent we would be subject to the excise tax in connection with an initial BusinessCombination or otherwise would depend on a number of factors, including (i) the fair market value of the stock subject to redemptionsand repurchases or exchanged in an acquisitive reorganization in connection with the initial Business Combination, (ii) the structureof the initial Business Combination, (iii) the nature and amount of any private investment in public equity or other equity issuancesin connection with the initial Business Combination (or otherwise issued not in connection with the initial Business Combination but issuedwithin the same taxable year of the initial Business Combination) and (iv) the content of regulations and other guidance from the Treasury.In addition, because the excise tax would be payable by us, and not by the redeeming holder, the mechanics of any required payment ofthe excise tax have not been determined. The foregoing could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to complete an initial BusinessCombination and in our ability to complete an initial Business Combination and might affect the structure chosen for an initial BusinessCombination and any potential financing in connection with the initial Business Combination. In connection with the adoption of the ThirdAmended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, we redeemed 8,980,535 shares of our Common Stock on December 22, 2022. Because suchredemption occurred prior to December 31, 2022 (and the stated effectiveness of the IRA), we do not believe any such redemptions are subjectto the provisions of the IRA or any associated excise tax liability; however, we cannot assure you that this will be the case or thatif we are subject to excise tax liability, whether in connection with such redemptions described above or otherwise, that we will havefunds sufficient to pay such excise tax liability. Additionally, at the Special Meeting of shareholders held on July 12,2023, holders of 381,144 shares of Common Stock of the Company exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at an approximateprice of $10.50 per share, for an aggregate payment of approximately $4,002,722. The Company has recorded excise tax liability of $40,027in connection with such redemption. Additionally, at the Special Meeting of shareholders held on December 18, 2023, holders of 87,380shares of Common Stock of the Company exercised their right to redeem their shares for cash at an approximate price of $10.90 per share,for an aggregate payment of approximately $952,940. The Company has recorded excise tax liability of $9,529.40 in connection with suchredemption. As a result, and in connection with a potential excise tax on share repurchases imposed by the IR Act, we have recorded aliability entitled “Common stock redemption payable” on our condensed balance sheets as of December 31, 2022 (and a zero balancefor such liability as of December 31, 2023 as a result of the completion of the redemption repayments in January 2023), and a currentliability entitled “Excise tax liability accrued for common stock with redemptions” of $391,544 (including $341,988 pertainingto December 2022 Redemptions) on our condensed statements of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2023. The referenced current liabilitydoes not impact the condensed statements of operations during the referenced period and is offset against additional paid-in capital oraccumulated deficit if additional paid-in capital is not available. Additionally, this excise tax liability may be offset by future shareissuances within the same fiscal year as the liability was recorded, which will be evaluated and adjusted in the period in which the issuances,if any, occur. 52  We are an “emerging growth company”and “smaller reporting company” within the meaning of the Securities Act and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosurerequirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies will make our securities less attractive to investors. We are an “emerging growth company”within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reportingrequirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not beingrequired to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligationsregarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbindingadvisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result,our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up tofive years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our shares held by non-affiliatesexceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the followingDecember 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. Ifsome investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securitiesmay be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of oursecurities may be more volatile. Further, Section 102(b)(1) of theJOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until privatecompanies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securitiesregistered under the Exchange Act) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act providesthat a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growthcompanies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period, whichmeans that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerginggrowth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparisonof our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company whichhas opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standardsused. Additionally, we are a “smaller reportingcompany” as defined in Rule 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosureobligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reportingcompany until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 millionas of the prior June 30, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of ourshares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30. To the extent we take advantage of such reduced disclosureobligations, it may also make comparison of our financial statements with other public companies difficult or impossible. We haveidentified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. This material weakness could adversely affect our abilityto report our results of operations and financial condition accurately or in a timely manner. Our management is responsible forestablishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. Our managementis likewise required, on a quarterly basis, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and to disclose any changes and materialweaknesses identified through such evaluation in those internal controls. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies,in internal controls over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annualor interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As described elsewhere in Item 9A,“Controls and Procedures” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have identified a material weakness in our internal controlover financial reporting, specifically related to accounting and valuation for complex financial instruments. In light of this materialweakness, we performed additional analysis as deemed necessary to ensure that our financial statements were prepared in accordance withGAAP and management believes that the financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K present fairly in all materialrespects our financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented. 53  Failure to maintain internal controlsmay adversely impact our ability to report our financial position and results from operations on a timely and accurate basis. If our financialstatements are not accurate, investors may not have a complete understanding of our operations. Likewise, if our financial statementsare not filed on a timely basis, we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our Common Stock islisted, the SEC or other regulatory authorities. In either case, there could result a material adverse effect on our business. Ineffectiveinternal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effecton the trading price of our Common Stock. We can give no assurance that the measures we havetaken and plan to take in the future will fully remediate the material weakness identified or that any additional material weaknesseswhich may require restatements of financial results will not be identified or arise in the future due to a failure to implement and maintainadequate internal control over financial reporting or circumvention of these controls. In addition, even if we are successful in strengtheningour controls and procedures, in the future those controls and procedures may not be adequate to prevent or identify irregularities orerrors or to facilitate the fair presentation of our financial statements. Our management concluded that there is substantialdoubt about our ability to continue as a “going concern.” At December 31, 2023, we had $48,395in cash and working capital deficit of $4,125,881. Further, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuitof our financing and acquisition plans. Management’s plans to address this need for capital are discussed in the section of thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K titled “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”We cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to consummate an initial Business Combination will be successful. These factors,among others, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements contained elsewhere inthis Annual Report on Form 10-K do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to continue as a going concern. "
