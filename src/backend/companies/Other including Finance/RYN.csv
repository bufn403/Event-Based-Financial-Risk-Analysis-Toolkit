10,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2017-02-24,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations are subject to a number of risks. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.We are exposed to the cyclicality of the markets in which we operate and other factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the construction and home building industries, the global pulp, packaging and paper industries and the real estate industry, are cyclical in nature, exposing us to risks beyond our control, including general macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as local economic conditions.In our Timber segments, the level of new residential construction activity and, to a lesser extent, home repair and remodeling activity, is the primary driver of sawtimber demand. In addition, demand for logs can be affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper and engineered wood products markets, as well as the bio-energy production markets. The ongoing level of activity in these markets is subject to fluctuation due to future changes in economic conditions, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and other factors. Changes in global economic conditions, such as new timber supply sources and changes in currency exchange rates, foreign interest rates and foreign and domestic trade policies, can also negatively impact demand for our timber and logs. In addition, the industries in which these customers participate are highly competitive and may experience overcapacity or reductions in demand, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. For example, the supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices, and can have an adverse effect on our business.In our Real Estate segment, our inability to sell our HBU properties at attractive prices could have a significant effect on our results of operations. Demand for real estate can be affected by the availability of capital, changes in interest rates, availability and terms of financing, governmental agencies, developers, conservation organizations, individuals and others seeking to purchase our timberlands, our ability to obtain land use entitlements and other permits necessary for our development activities, local real estate market economic conditions, competition from other sellers of land and real estate developers, the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, employment rates, new housing starts, population growth, demographics and federal, state and local land use, zoning and environmental protections laws or regulations (including any changes in laws or regulations). In addition, changes in investor interest in purchasing timberlands could reduce our ability to execute sales of non-strategic timberlands.These macroeconomic and cyclical factors impacting our operations are beyond our control and, if such conditions deteriorate or do not continue to improve, could have an adverse effect on our business.Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.Weather conditions and extreme events, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access (for example, due to prolonged wet conditions) and other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes, may limit harvesting of our timberlands. The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by any such fire, insect infestation, disease, severe weather, prolonged drought, natural disasters and other causes beyond our control. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to fire and these other causes. These and other factors beyond our control could reduce our timber inventory and accordingly, our sustainable yield, thereby adversely affecting our financial results and cash flows.Entitlement and development of real estate entail a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process, which could adversely affect our ability to grow the businesses in our Real Estate segment.Entitlement and development of real estate entail extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is common for a project to require multiple approvals, permits and consents from U.S. federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Community Planning Act and local land use, zoning and development regulations. In addition, development projects in Florida that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds (and are not located in a jurisdiction classified as a dense urban land area) may require approval pursuant to specialized Comprehensive Plan evaluation and process standards. Compliance with these and other regulations and standards is more time intensive and costly and may require additional long range infrastructure review and approvals which can add to project cost. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands may require one or more permits from the U.S. federal government and/or state and local governmental agencies. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost, timing and economic viability of our real estate projects. 12Table of ContentsThe real estate entitlement process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. In the U.S., a significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, water availability, transportation and other infrastructure, and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Community Planning Act process standards. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, in filing litigation to oppose particular entitlement activities and development projects, and in seeking legislation and other anti-development limitations on real estate development activities. We expect this type of anti-development activity to continue in the future.Issues affecting real estate development also include the availability of potable water for new development projects. For example, the Georgia Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act, which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the southern Georgia coast, where the Company has significant timberland holdings with downstream real estate development potential. Concerns about the availability of potable water also exist in certain Florida counties, which could impact future growth opportunities.Changes in the laws, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs and delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.Changes in energy and fuel costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition.Energy costs are a significant operating expense for our logging and hauling contractors and for the contractors who support the customers of our standing timber. Energy costs can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases or decreases due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. Although the price of oil has recently decreased, increases in the price of oil could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an increase in fuel costs, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation for our products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third-party logging and hauling contractors, could have a material adverse effect on the operating costs of our contractors and our standing timber customers, as well as in defining economically accessible timber stands. Such factors could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly in our Timber segments and Trading segment.We depend on third parties for logging and transportation services and increases in the costs or decreases in the availability of quality service providers could adversely affect our business.Our Timber segments depend on logging and transportation services provided by third parties, both domestically and internationally, including by railroad, trucks, or ships. If any of our transportation providers were to fail to deliver timber supply or logs to our customers in a timely manner, or were to damage timber supply or logs during transport, we may be unable to sell it at full value, or at all. During the global financial crisis and subsequent downturn in U.S. housing starts, timber harvest volumes declined significantly. As a result, many logging contractors, particularly cable logging operators in the U.S. West, permanently shut down their operations. As harvest levels have returned to higher levels with the recovery in U.S. housing starts, this shortage of logging contractors has resulted in sharp increases in logging costs and in the availability of logging contractors. It is expected that the supply of qualified logging contractors will be impacted by the availability of debt financing for equipment purchases as well as a sufficient supply of adequately trained loggers. As housing starts continue to recover, harvest levels are expected to increase, placing more pressure on the existing supply of logging contractors. Any significant failure or unavailability of third-party logging or transportation providers, or increases in transportation rates or fuel costs, may result in higher logging costs or the inability to capitalize on stronger log prices to the extent logging contractors cannot be secured at a competitive cost. Such events could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and adversely affect our business. 13Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S.Although the majority of our customers are in the U.S., a significant portion of our sales are to end markets outside of the U.S., including China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, India and New Zealand. The export of our products into international markets results in risks inherent in conducting business pursuant to international laws, regulations and customs. We expect that international sales will continue to contribute to future growth. The risks associated with our business outside the U.S. include:•changes in and reinterpretations of the laws, regulations and enforcement priorities of the countries in which our products are sold; •responsibility to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions; •trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements;•difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations; •product damage or losses incurred during shipping; •potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; •economic or political instability, inflation, recessions and interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; and•uncertainties regarding non-U.S. judicial systems, rules and procedures.•uncertainties regarding changes in trade policies under consideration by the current presidential administration.These risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been named as parties to various lawsuits relating to matters arising out of our previously announced internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, and may be named in further litigation or become subject to regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions.The matters that led to our internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. We and certain of our current and former officers and directors are the subjects of a number of purported class action lawsuits and demand letters. In addition, we were previously the subject of a private SEC inquiry. These actions arose from our announcement on November 10, 2014 regarding the results of our internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2014. We and our current and former officers and directors may, in the future, be subject to additional private and governmental actions relating to such matters. We cannot predict the duration, outcome or impact of these matters, but the lawsuits could result in judgments against us and officers and directors who are now or may become named as defendants. In addition, subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify and advance expenses for our current and former officers and directors in connection with such lawsuits and regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions and any related litigation or settlements amounts.Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits, and any other litigation, regulatory proceedings, or government enforcement actions that may be brought against us or our current or former officers and directors, could be time-consuming, result in significant expense, and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees. Our legal expenses incurred in defending the lawsuits and responding to any government inquiries could be significant. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could exceed coverage provided under potentially applicable insurance policies, which is limited. Any such unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we could be required to pay damages or additional penalties, or have other remedies imposed against us, or our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 14Table of ContentsOur estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate, include risks inherent to such estimates and may impair our ability to realize expected revenues.We rely upon estimates of merchantable timber inventories (which include judgments regarding inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested), timber growth rates and end-product yields when acquiring and managing working forests. These estimates, which are inherently inexact and uncertain in nature, are central to forecasting our anticipated timber revenues and expected cash flows. Growth rates and end-product yield estimates are developed using statistical sampling and growth and yield modeling, in conjunction with industry research cooperatives and by in-house forest biometricians, using measurements of trees in research plots spread across our timberland holdings. The growth equations predict the rate of height and diameter growth of trees so that foresters can estimate the volume of timber that may be present in the tree stand at a given age. Tree growth varies by soil type, geographic area, and climate. Inappropriate application of growth equations in forest management planning may lead to inaccurate estimates of future volumes. If the assumptions we rely upon change or these estimates are inaccurate, our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be diminished, which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected.Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change, and new laws and regulations are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, remediate contaminated properties and/or entitle real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands and endangered species, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, wastewater discharges, receiving water quality, timber harvesting practices, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has pursued a number of initiatives that, if implemented, could impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like those of Rayonier’s customers, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and stormwater control. In addition, as a result of certain judicial rulings and EPA initiatives, including some that would require timberland operators to obtain permits to conduct certain ordinary course forestry activities, silvicultural practices on our timberlands could be impacted in the future. Environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. We are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities related to our properties. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber and New Zealand Timber segments, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency. Actions by the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands. For example, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. For example, interveners at times may bring legal action in Florida in opposition to entitlement and change of use of timberlands to commercial, industrial or residential use. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any threatened or actual lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands, affect how we operate or limit our ability to modify or invest in our real estate. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands. 15Table of ContentsThe impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. Restrictions relating to threatened and endangered species apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the restricted area varies depending on the protected species, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one acre to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near our timberlands, including, among others, the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, several species of salmon and trout in the Pacific Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, red hills salamander and eastern indigo snake in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) or similar U.S. federal and state laws. A significant number of other species, such as the southeastern gopher tortoise and certain species of southern pine snake are currently under review for possible protection under the ESA. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.We formerly owned or operated or may own or acquire timberlands or properties that may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We owned or operated manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations that we do not currently own, and we may currently own or may acquire timberlands and other properties in the future that are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. In connection with the spin-off of our Performance Fibers business, and pursuant to the related Separation and Distribution Agreement between us and Rayonier Advanced Materials, Rayonier Advanced Materials has assumed any environmental liability of ours in connection with the manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations related to the Performance Fibers business and has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless in connection with such environmental liabilities. However, in the event we seek indemnification from Rayonier Advanced Materials, we cannot provide any assurance that a court will enforce our indemnification right if challenged by Rayonier Advanced Materials or that Rayonier Advanced Materials will be able to fund any amounts for indemnification owed to us. In addition, the cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated timberlands and properties that we currently own or acquire in the future could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. We could also incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), clean-up and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations related to such timberlands or properties.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do in each of these businesses. The competitive pressures relating to our Timber segments are primarily driven by quantity of product supply and quality of the timber offered by competitors in the domestic and export markets, each of which may impact pricing. With respect to our Real Estate segment, we compete with other owners of entitled and unentitled properties. Each property has unique attributes, but overall quantity of supply and price for residential, commercial, industrial and rural properties in the geographic areas in which we operate are the most significant competitive drivers. The market in which our Trading segment operates remains very competitive with over 20 entities competing for export log supply at different ports across New Zealand.Our strategy will be adversely affected if we are unable to make future acquisitions.We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, acquisitions of timberland and real estate properties that meet our investment criteria and achieve our strategic goals of growing the size and average quality of our land base. The ability to grow through acquisitions or other investments depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture partnerships. In addition, the discount rate we use in our acquisition underwriting has to meet our internal hurdle rate while also being competitive with that of other timberland REITs and TIMOs. In particular, our future success and growth depend upon our ability to make acquisitions that increase merchantable timber inventory and complement the existing age-class structure of our ownership. If we are unable to make acquisitions on acceptable terms or that do not support our strategic goals, our revenues and cash flows may stagnate or decline. 16Table of ContentsOur inability to access the capital markets could adversely affect our business strategy and competitive position.Due to the REIT income distribution requirements, we rely significantly on external sources of capital to finance growth and acquisitions. Both our ability to obtain financing and the related costs of borrowing are affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including a decline in general market conditions, decreased market liquidity, a downgrade to our public debt rating, increases in interest rates, an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. If capital is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms relative to other timberland REITs or TIMOs, or not at all, we may be unable to complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. As of December 31, 2016, our credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) were BBB- and Baa3, respectively. Any combination of the factors described above, including our failure to maintain our investment grade credit rating, could prevent us from obtaining the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and competitive position. We are subject to risks associated with an increase in market interest rates.One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as compared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates could result in higher yields on other financial instruments and could adversely affect relative attractiveness of an investment in the Company and, accordingly, the trading price of our common shares. An increase in market interest rates could cause increases in discount rates and, accordingly, a decline in property values and total returns for timberland assets. An increase in market interest rates would also negatively impact financing costs on our floating rate debt as well as any additional debt we may raise.Investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.We sponsor now frozen defined benefit pension plans, which covered a portion of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these benefit plans. At December 31, 2016, our qualified plan was underfunded by approximately $31 million. We estimate that we are subject to approximately $0.3 million of pension contribution requirements in 2017. Because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, we cannot provide any assurance that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. Any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for additional information about these plans, including funding status.The impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, U.S. federal and state levels, remain uncertain at this time.There continue to be numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use “cleaner” energy.In late 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” under the Clean Air Act with respect to certain greenhouse gases, leading to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and having significant ramifications for Rayonier and the industry in general. In this regard, the EPA has published various regulations, affecting the operation of existing and new industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide. As a result of the EPA’s decision to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, states will now have to consider them in permitting new or modified facilities.Overall, it is reasonably likely that legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way affect Rayonier and the U.S. customers of our Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber segments, but it is unclear at this time what the nature of the impact will be. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier, from a cost, benefit and financial performance standpoint remains uncertain at this time. In addition, the EPA has yet to finalize the treatment of biomass under greenhouse gas regulatory schemes leaving Rayonier’s biomass customers in a position of uncertainty. 17Table of ContentsREIT and Tax-Related RisksLoss of our REIT status would adversely affect our cash flow and stock price.We intend to continue to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and related U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative guidance. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not within our control. We cannot assure that we will remain qualified as a REIT or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification. We continually monitor and test our compliance with all REIT requirements. In particular, we regularly test our compliance with the REIT “asset tests,” which require generally that, at the close of each calendar quarter, (1) at least 75% of the market value of our total assets must consist of REIT-qualifying interests in real property (such as timberlands), including leaseholds and options to acquire real property and leaseholds, as well as cash and cash items and certain other specified assets, (2) no more than 25% of the market value of our total assets may consist of other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% test in clause (1) above and (3) for calendar years prior to 2018, no more than 25% of the market value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more “taxable REIT subsidiaries.”If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income. In addition, we will be disqualified from qualification as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. As of December 31, 2016, Rayonier is in compliance with the asset tests described above. If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay any resulting additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% tax on any net income from “prohibited transactions.” In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of logs, and dealer sales of timberlands or other real estate, constitute prohibited transactions.We intend to avoid the 100% prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that become part of our “dealer” real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to the 100% prohibited transactions tax.Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90% of their ordinary taxable income, but not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not generally believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is generally treated as capital gains income. However, a REIT must pay corporate level tax on its undistributed taxable income and capital gains.Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be paid to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate. 18Table of ContentsLack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50% or more of the value of its outstanding shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50% or more of the value of our outstanding shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT"
6,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2016-02-29,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations are subject to a number of risks. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.We are exposed to the cyclicality of the markets in which we operate and other factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the construction and home building industries, the global pulp, packaging and paper industries and the real estate industry, are cyclical in nature, exposing us to risks beyond our control, including general macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as local economic conditions.In our Timber segments, the level of new residential construction activity and, to a lesser extent, home repair and remodeling activity, is the primary driver of sawtimber demand. In addition, demand for logs can be affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper and engineered wood products markets, as well as the bio-energy production markets. The ongoing level of activity in these markets is subject to fluctuation due to future changes in economic conditions, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and other factors. Changes in global economic conditions, such as new timber supply sources and changes in currency exchange rates, foreign interest rates and foreign and domestic trade policies, can also negatively impact demand for our timber and logs. In addition, the industries in which these customers participate are highly competitive and may experience overcapacity or reductions in demand, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. For example, the supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices, and can have an adverse effect on our business.In our Real Estate segment, our inability to sell our HBU properties at attractive prices could have a significant effect on our results of operations. Demand for real estate can be affected by the availability of capital, changes in interest rates, availability and terms of financing, governmental agencies, developers, conservation organizations, individuals and others seeking to purchase our timberlands, our ability to obtain land use entitlements and other permits necessary for our development activities, local real estate market economic conditions, competition from other sellers of land and real estate developers, the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, employment rates, new housing starts, population growth, demographics and federal, state and local land use, zoning and environmental protections laws or regulations (including any changes in laws or regulations). In addition, changes in investor interest in purchasing timberlands could reduce our ability to execute sales of non-strategic timberlands.These macroeconomic and cyclical factors impacting our operations are beyond our control and, if such conditions deteriorate or do not continue to improve, could have an adverse effect on our business.Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.Weather conditions and extreme events, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access (for example, due to prolonged wet conditions) and other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes, may limit harvesting of our timberlands. The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by any such fire, insect infestation, disease, severe weather, prolonged drought, natural disasters and other causes beyond our control. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to fire and these other causes. These and other factors beyond our control could reduce our timber inventory and accordingly, our sustainable yield, thereby adversely affecting our financial results and cash flows.Entitlement and development of real estate entail a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process, which could adversely affect our ability to grow the businesses in our Real Estate segment.Entitlement and development of real estate entail extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is common for a project to require multiple approvals, permits and consents from U.S. federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Community Planning Act and local land use, zoning and development regulations. In addition, development projects in Florida that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds (and are not located in a jurisdiction classified as a dense urban land area) may require approval pursuant to specialized Comprehensive Plan evaluation and process standards. Compliance with these and other regulations and standards is more time intensive and costly and may require additional long range infrastructure review and approvals which can add to project cost. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands may require one or more permits from the U.S. federal government and/or state and local governmental agencies. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost, timing and economic viability of our real estate projects. 11Table of ContentsThe real estate entitlement process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. In the U.S., a significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, water availability, transportation and other infrastructure, and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Community Planning Act process standards. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, in filing litigation to oppose particular entitlement activities and development projects, and in seeking legislation and other anti-development limitations on real estate development activities. We expect this type of anti-development activity to continue in the future.Issues affecting real estate development also include the availability of potable water for new development projects. For example, the Georgia Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act, which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the southern Georgia coast, where the Company has significant timberland holdings with downstream real estate development potential. Concerns about the availability of potable water also exist in certain Florida counties, which could impact future growth opportunities.Changes in the laws, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs and delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.Changes in energy and fuel costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition.Energy costs are a significant operating expense for our logging and hauling contractors and for the contractors who support the customers of our standing timber. Energy costs can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases or decreases due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. Although the price of oil has recently decreased, increases in the price of oil could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an increase in fuel costs, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation for our products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third party logging and hauling contractors, could have a material adverse effect on the operating costs of our contractors and our standing timber customers, as well as in defining economically accessible timber stands. Such factors could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly in our Timber segments and Trading segment.We depend on third parties for logging and transportation services and increases in the costs or decreases in the availability of quality service providers could adversely affect our business.Our Timber segments depend on logging and transportation services provided by third parties, both domestically and internationally, including by railroad, trucks, or ships. If any of our transportation providers were to fail to deliver timber supply or logs to our customers in a timely manner, or were to damage timber supply or logs during transport, we may be unable to sell it at full value, or at all. During the global financial crisis and subsequent downturn in U.S. housing starts, timber harvest volumes declined significantly. As a result, many logging contractors, particularly cable logging operators in the U.S. West, permanently shut down their operations. As harvest levels have returned to higher levels with the recovery in U.S. housing starts, this shortage of logging contractors has resulted in sharp increases in logging costs and in the availability of logging contractors. It is expected that the supply of qualified logging contractors will be impacted by the availability of debt financing for equipment purchases as well as a sufficient supply of adequately trained loggers. As housing starts continue to recover, harvest levels are expected to increase, placing more pressure on the existing supply of logging contractors. Any significant failure or unavailability of third-party logging or transportation providers, or increases in transportation rates or fuel costs, may result in higher logging costs or the inability to capitalize on stronger log prices to the extent logging contractors cannot be secured at a competitive cost. Such events could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and adversely affect our business. 12Table of ContentsWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S.Although the majority of our customers are in the U.S., a portion of our sales are to end markets outside of the U.S., including China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, India and New Zealand. The export of our products into international markets results in risks inherent in conducting business pursuant to international laws, regulations and customs. We expect that international sales will continue to contribute to future growth. The risks associated with our business outside the U.S. include:•changes in and reinterpretations of the laws, regulations and enforcement priorities of the countries in which our products are sold; •responsibility to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions; •trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements;•difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations; •product damage or losses incurred during shipping; •potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; •economic or political instability, inflation, recessions and interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; and•uncertainties regarding non-U.S. judicial systems, rules and procedures.These risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been named as parties to various lawsuits relating to matters arising out of our previously announced internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, and may be named in further litigation or become subject to regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions.The matters that led to our internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. We and certain of our current and former officers and directors are the subjects of a number of purported class action lawsuits and demand letters. In addition, we are currently the subject of an ongoing private SEC inquiry. These actions arise from our announcement on November 10, 2014 regarding the results of our internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2014. We and our current and former officers and directors may, in the future, be subject to additional private and governmental actions relating to such matters. We cannot predict the duration, outcome or impact of these pending matters, but the lawsuits could result in judgments against us and officers and directors who are now or may become named as defendants. In addition, subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify and advance expenses for our current and former officers and directors in connection with such lawsuits and regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions and any related litigation or settlements amounts.Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits, and any other litigation, regulatory proceedings, or government enforcement actions that may be brought against us or our current or former officers and directors, could be time-consuming, result in significant expense, and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees. Our legal expenses incurred in defending the lawsuits and responding to any government inquiries could be significant. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could exceed coverage provided under potentially applicable insurance policies, which is limited. Any such unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we could be required to pay damages or additional penalties, or have other remedies imposed against us, or our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 13Table of ContentsOur estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate, include risks inherent to such estimates and may impair our ability to realize expected revenues.We rely upon estimates of merchantable timber inventories (which include judgments regarding inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested), timber growth rates and end-product yields when acquiring and managing working forests. These estimates, which are inherently inexact and uncertain in nature, are central to forecasting our anticipated timber revenues and expected cash flows. Growth rates and end-product yield estimates are developed using statistical sampling and growth and yield modeling in conjunction with industry research cooperatives and by in-house forest biometricians using measurements of trees in research plots spread across our timberland holdings. The growth equations predict the rate of height and diameter growth of trees so that foresters can estimate the volume of timber that may be present in the tree stand at a given age. Tree growth varies by soil type, geographic area, and climate. Inappropriate application of growth equations in forest management planning may lead to inaccurate estimates of future volumes. If the assumptions we rely upon change or these estimates are inaccurate, our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be diminished, which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected.Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change, and new laws and regulations are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, remediate contaminated properties and/or entitle real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands and endangered species, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, wastewater discharges, receiving water quality, timber harvesting practices, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Moreover, environmental policies of the current U.S. administration are more restrictive in the aggregate for industry and landowners than those of the previous administration. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has pursued a number of initiatives that, if implemented, could impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like those of Rayonier’s customers, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and stormwater control. In addition, as a result of certain judicial rulings and EPA initiatives, including some that would require timberland operators to obtain permits to conduct certain ordinary course forestry activities, silvicultural practices on our timberlands could be impacted in the future. Environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. We are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities related to our properties. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber and New Zealand Timber segments, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency. Actions by the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Delays in obtaining these environmental permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands. For example, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. For example, interveners at times may bring legal action in Florida in opposition to entitlement and change of use of timberlands to commercial, industrial or residential use. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any threatened or actual lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands, affect how we operate or limit our ability to modify or invest in our real estate. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands. 14Table of ContentsThe impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. Restrictions relating to threatened and endangered species apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the restricted area varies depending on the protected species, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one acre to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near our timberlands, including, among others, the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, several species of salmon and trout in the Pacific Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, red hills salamander and eastern indigo snake in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) or similar U.S. federal and state laws. A significant number of other species, such as the southeastern gopher tortoise and certain species of southern pine snake are currently under review for possible protection under the ESA. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.We formerly owned or operated or may own or acquire timberlands or properties that may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We owned or operated manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations that we do not currently own, and we may currently own or may acquire timberlands and other properties in the future that are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. In connection with the spin-off of our Performance Fibers business, and pursuant to the related Separation and Distribution Agreement between us and Rayonier Advanced Materials, Rayonier Advanced Materials has assumed any environmental liability of ours in connection with the manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations related to the Performance Fibers business and has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless in connection with such environmental liabilities. However, in the event we seek indemnification from Rayonier Advanced Materials, we cannot provide any assurance that a court will enforce our indemnification right if challenged by Rayonier Advanced Materials or that Rayonier Advanced Materials will be able to fund any amounts for indemnification owed to us. In addition, the cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated timberlands and properties that we currently own or acquire in the future could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. We could also incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), clean-up and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations related to such timberlands or properties.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with companies that have substantially greater financial resources than we do in each of these businesses. The competitive pressures relating to our Timber segments are primarily driven by quantity of product supply and quality of the timber offered by competitors in the domestic and export markets, each of which may impact pricing. With respect to our Real Estate segment, we compete with other owners of entitled and unentitled properties. Each property has unique attributes, but overall quantity of supply and price for residential, commercial, industrial and rural properties in the geographic areas in which we operate are the most significant competitive drivers. The market in which our Trading segment operates remains very competitive with over 20 entities competing for export log supply at different ports across New Zealand.Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to make future acquisitions.We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, acquisitions of timberland and real estate properties that meet our investment criteria and achieve our strategic goals of growing the size and average quality of our land base. The ability to grow through acquisitions or other investments depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture partnerships. In addition, the discount rate we use in our acquisition underwriting has to meet our internal hurdle rate while also being competitive with that of other timberland REITs and TIMOs. In particular, our future success and growth depend upon our ability to make acquisitions that increase merchantable timber inventory and complement the existing age class structure of our ownership. If we are unable to make acquisitions on acceptable terms or that do not support our strategic goals, our revenues and cash flows may stagnate or decline. 15Table of ContentsOur inability to access the capital markets could adversely affect our business and competitive position.Due to the REIT income distribution requirements, we rely significantly on external sources of capital to finance growth and acquisitions. Both our ability to obtain financing and the related costs of borrowing are affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including a decline in general market conditions, decreased market liquidity, a downgrade to our public debt rating, increases in interest rates, an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. If capital is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms relative to other timberland REITs or TIMOs, or not at all, we may be unable to complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. As of December 31, 2015, our credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) were BBB- and Baa2, respectively. Any combination of the factors described above, including our failure to maintain our investment grade credit rating, could prevent us from obtaining the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and competitive position. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the price of our common shares.One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as compared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect relative attractiveness of an investment in the Company and, accordingly, the price of our common shares.There are risks to the Company associated with the spin-off of our Performance Fibers business.The Company faces a number of risks related to the spin-off of our Performance Fibers business on June 27, 2014, including the following:•We may not achieve the expected benefits from the spin-off. After the spin-off, we believe that we will be able to, among other things, better focus our financial and operational resources, and design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted toward our specific businesses’ growth profile and strategic priorities, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs and more effectively respond to industry dynamics. However, the Company may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off, and the spin-off could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit or retain, key personnel needed to operate and grow our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a standalone company, or do not achieve them in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.•Our business is less diversified. Our operational and financial profile has changed as a result of the spin-off of the Performance Fibers business. As a result, our diversification of revenue sources has diminished without the revenue previously generated by the Performance Fibers business, and it is possible that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility related to the timber business and the markets we serve. If we are unable to manage that volatility, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.We sponsor defined benefit pension plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these benefit plans. At December 31, 2015, our qualified plan was underfunded by $32 million, but we are not subject to any pension contribution requirements in 2016. Because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, we cannot provide any assurance that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. Any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for additional information about these plans, including funding status. 16Table of ContentsThe impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, U.S. federal and state levels, remain uncertain at this time.There continue to be numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use “cleaner” energy.In late 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” under the Clean Air Act with respect to certain greenhouse gases, leading to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and having significant ramifications for Rayonier and the industry in general. In this regard, the EPA has published various regulations, affecting the operation of existing and new industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide. As a result of the EPA’s decision to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, states will now have to consider them in permitting new or modified facilities.Overall, it is reasonably likely that legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way affect Rayonier and the U.S. customers of our Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber segments, but it is unclear at this time what the nature of the impact will be. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier, from a cost, benefit and financial performance standpoint remains uncertain at this time. In addition, the EPA has yet to finalize the treatment of biomass under greenhouse gas regulatory schemes leaving Rayonier’s biomass customers in a position of uncertainty.REIT and Tax-Related RisksIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholders because our REIT income will be subject to taxation.We intend to continue to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and related U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative guidance. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not within our control. We cannot assure that we will remain qualified as a REIT or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification.We continually monitor and test our compliance with all REIT requirements. In particular, we regularly test our compliance with the REIT “asset tests,” which require generally that, at the close of each calendar quarter, (1) at least 75% of the market value of our total assets must consist of REIT-qualifying interests in real property (such as timberlands), including leaseholds and options to acquire real property and leaseholds, as well as cash and cash items and certain other specified assets, (2) no more than 25% of the market value of our total assets may consist of other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% test in clause (1) above and (3) for calendar years prior to 2018, no more than 25% of the market value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more “taxable REIT subsidiaries.”If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our REIT taxable income. In addition, we will be disqualified from qualification as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. As of December 31, 2015, Rayonier is in compliance with the asset tests described above. If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay any resulting additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced. 17Table of ContentsCertain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100% tax on any net income from “prohibited transactions.” In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of logs, and dealer sales of timberlands or other real estate, constitute prohibited transactions.We intend to avoid the 100% prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that become part of our “dealer” real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to the 100% prohibited transactions tax.Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90% of their ordinary taxable income, but not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not generally believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is generally treated as capital gains income. However, a REIT must pay corporate level tax on its undistributed taxable income and capital gains.Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be paid to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50% or more of the value of its outstanding shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50% or more of the value of our outstanding shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. 18Table of Contents"
4,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2015-03-02,"Risk Factors
Our operations are subject to a number of risks. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.We are exposed to the cyclicality of the markets in which we operate and other factors beyond our control, which could adversely affect our results of operations.Some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the construction and home building industries, the global pulp and paper industries and the real estate industry, are cyclical in nature, exposing us to risks beyond our control, including general macroeconomic conditions, both in the U.S. and globally, as well as local economic conditions.In our Timber segments, the level of new residential construction activity and, to a lesser extent, home repair and remodeling activity, is the primary driver of sawtimber demand. In addition, demand for logs can be affected by the demand for wood chips in the pulp and paper and engineered wood products markets, as well as the bio-energy production markets. The ongoing level of activity in these markets is subject to fluctuation due to future changes in economic conditions, interest rates, credit availability, population growth, weather conditions and other factors. Changes in global economic conditions, such as new timber supply sources and changes in currency exchange rates, foreign interest rates and foreign and domestic trade policies, can also negatively impact demand for our timber and logs. In addition, the industries in which these customers participate are highly competitive and may experience overcapacity or reductions in demand, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. For example, the supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices, which can have an adverse effect on our business.In our Real Estate segment, our inability to sell our HBU properties at attractive prices could have a significant effect on our results of operations. Demand for real estate can be affected by the availability of capital, changes in interest rates, availability and terms of financing governmental agencies, developers, conservation organizations, individuals and others seeking to purchase our timberlands, our ability to obtain land use entitlements and other permits necessary for our development activities, local real estate market economic conditions, competition from other sellers of land and real estate developers, the relative illiquidity of real estate investments, employment rates, new housing starts, population growth, demographics and federal, state and local land use, zoning and environmental protections laws or regulations (including any changes in laws or regulations). In addition, changes in investor interest in purchasing timberlands could reduce our ability to execute sales of non-strategic timberlands.These macroeconomic and cyclical factors impacting our operations are beyond our control and, if such conditions deteriorate or do not continue to improve, could have an adverse effect on our business.Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.Weather conditions and extreme events, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access (for example, due to prolonged wet conditions) and other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes, may limit harvesting of our timberlands. The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by any such fire, insect infestation, disease, severe weather, prolonged drought, natural disasters and other causes beyond our control. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to fire and these other causes. These and other factors beyond our control could reduce our timber inventory and accordingly, our sustainable yield, thereby adversely affecting our financial results and cash flows.Entitlement and development of real estate entail a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process, which could adversely affect our ability to grow the businesses in our Real Estate segment.Entitlement and development of real estate entail extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is common for a project to require multiple approvals, permits and consents from U.S. federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Community Planning Act and local land use, zoning and development regulations. In addition, development projects in Florida that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds (and are not located in a jurisdiction classified as a dense urban land area) require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (“DRI”) application. Compliance with these and other regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly, and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands may require one or more permits from the U.S. federal government and/or state and local governmental agencies. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost, timing and economic viability of our real estate projects. 11The real estate entitlement process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. In the U.S., a significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, water availability, transportation and other infrastructure, and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Community Planning Act and DRI process. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, in filing litigation to oppose particular entitlement activities and development projects, and in seeking legislation and other anti-development limitations on real estate development activities. We expect this type of anti-development activity to continue in the future.Issues affecting real estate development also include the availability of potable water for new development projects. For example, the Georgia Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act, which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the southern Georgia coast, where the Company has significant timberland holdings with downstream real estate development potential. Concerns about the availability of potable water also exist in certain Florida counties, which could impact future growth opportunities.Changes in the laws, or interpretation or enforcement thereof, regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs and delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.Changes in energy and fuel costs could affect our results of operations and financial condition.Energy costs are a significant operating expense for our logging and hauling contractors and for the contractors who support the customers of our standing timber. Energy costs can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases or decreases due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. Although the price of oil has recently decreased, increases in the price of oil could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, an increase in fuel costs, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation for our products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third party logging and hauling contractors, could have a material adverse effect on the operating costs of our contractors and our standing timber customers, as well as in defining economically accessible timber stands. Such factors could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, particularly in our Timber segments and Trading segment.We depend on third parties for logging and transportation services and increases in the costs or decreases in the availability of quality service providers could adversely affect our business.Our Timber segments depend on logging and transportation services provided by third parties, both domestically and internationally, including by railroad, trucks, or ships. If any of our transportation providers were to fail to deliver timber supply or logs to our customers in a timely manner, or were to damage timber supply or logs during transport, we may be unable to sell it at full value, or at all. During the global financial crisis and subsequent downturn in U.S. housing starts, timber harvest volumes declined significantly. As a result, many logging contractors, particularly cable logging operators in the U.S. West, permanently shut down their operations.  As harvest levels have returned to higher levels with the recovery in U.S. housing starts, this shortage of logging contractors has resulted in sharp increases in logging costs and in the availability of logging contractors. It is expected that the supply of qualified logging contractors will be impacted by the availability of debt financing for equipment purchases as well as a sufficient supply of adequately trained loggers. As housing starts continue to recover, harvest levels are expected to increase, placing more pressure on the existing supply of logging contractors. Any significant failure or unavailability of third-party logging or transportation providers, or increases in transportation rates or fuel costs, may result in higher logging costs or the inability to capitalize on stronger log prices to the extent logging contractors cannot be secured at a competitive cost. Such events could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and adversely affect our business. 12We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the U.S.Although the majority of our customers are in the U.S., a portion of our sales are to end markets outside of the U.S., including China, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, India and New Zealand. The export of our products into international markets results in risks inherent in conducting business pursuant to international laws, regulations and customs. We expect that international sales will continue to contribute to future growth. The risks associated with our business outside the U.S. include:•changes in and reinterpretations of the laws, regulations and enforcement priorities of the countries in which our products are sold; •responsibility to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions; •trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements;•difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations; •product damage or losses incurred during shipping; •potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws; •economic or political instability, inflation, recessions and interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; and•uncertainties regarding non-U.S. judicial systems, rules and procedures.These risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We and certain of our current and former officers and directors have been named as parties to various lawsuits relating to matters arising out of our previously announced internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements, and may be named in further litigation or become subject to regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions.The matters that led to our internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation, regulatory proceedings and government enforcement actions. We and certain of our current and former officers and directors are the subjects of a number of purported class action lawsuits and demand letters. In addition, we are currently the subject of an ongoing private SEC inquiry. These actions arise from our announcement on November 10, 2014 regarding the results of our internal review and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the first and second quarters of 2014. We and our current and former officers and directors may, in the future, be subject to additional private and governmental actions relating to such matters. We cannot predict the duration, outcome or impact of these pending matters, but the lawsuits could result in judgments against us and officers and directors who are now or may become named as defendants. In addition, subject to certain limitations, we are obligated to indemnify and advance expenses for our current and former officers and directors in connection with such lawsuits and regulatory proceedings or government enforcement actions and any related litigation or settlements amounts.Regardless of the outcome, these lawsuits, and any other litigation, regulatory proceedings, or government enforcement actions that may be brought against us or our current or former officers and directors, could be time-consuming, result in significant expense, and divert the attention and resources of our management and other key employees. Our legal expenses incurred in defending the lawsuits and responding to any government inquiries could be significant. In addition, an unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could exceed coverage provided under potentially applicable insurance policies, which is limited. Any such unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Further, we could be required to pay damages or additional penalties, or have other remedies imposed against us, or our current or former directors or officers, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. 13Our estimates of timber inventories and growth rates may be inaccurate, include risks inherent to such estimates and may impair our ability to realize expected revenues.We rely upon estimates of merchantable timber inventories (which include judgments regarding inventories that may be lawfully and economically harvested), timber growth rates and end-product yields when acquiring and managing working forests. These estimates, which are inherently inexact and uncertain in nature, are central to forecasting our anticipated timber revenues and expected cash flows. Growth rates and end-product yield estimates are developed using statistical sampling and growth and yield modeling in conjunction with industry research cooperatives and by in-house forest biometricians using measurements of trees in research plots spread across our timberland holdings. The growth equations predict the rate of height and diameter growth of trees so that foresters can estimate the volume of timber that may be present in the tree stand at a given age. Tree growth varies by soil type, geographic area, and climate. Inappropriate application of growth equations in forest management planning may lead to inaccurate estimates of future volumes. If the assumptions we rely upon change or these estimates are inaccurate, our ability to manage our timberlands in a sustainable or profitable manner may be diminished, which may cause our results of operations and our stock price to be adversely affected.Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change, and new laws and regulations are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, remediate contaminated properties and/or entitle real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands and endangered species, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, wastewater discharges, receiving water quality, timber harvesting practices, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Moreover, environmental policies of the current U.S. administration are more restrictive in the aggregate for industry and landowners than those of the previous administration. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has pursued a number of initiatives that, if implemented, could impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like those of Rayonier’s customers, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and stormwater control. In addition, as a result of certain judicial rulings and EPA initiatives, including some that would require timberland operators to obtain permits to conduct certain ordinary course forestry activities, silvicultural practices on our timberlands could be impacted in the future. Environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. We are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities related to our properties. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Southern Timber, Pacific Northwest Timber and New Zealand Timber segments, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency. Actions by the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Delays in obtaining these environmental permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands. For example, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. For example, interveners at times may bring legal action in Florida in opposition to entitlement and change of use of timberlands to commercial, industrial or residential use. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any threatened or actual lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands, affect how we operate or limit our ability to modify or invest in our real estate. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands. 14The impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. Restrictions relating to threatened and endangered species apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the restricted area varies depending on the protected species, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one acre to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near our timberlands, including, among others, the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, several species of salmon and trout in the Pacific Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, Red Hills salamander and flatwoods salamander in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act (the “ESA”) or similar U.S. federal and state laws. A significant number of other species, such as the gopher tortoise and long-eared bat are currently under review for possible protection under the ESA. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.We formerly owned or operated or may own or acquire timberlands or properties that may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We owned or operated manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations that we do not currently own, and we may currently own or may acquire timberlands and other properties in the future that are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. In connection with the spin-off of our Performance Fibers business, and pursuant to the related Separation and Distribution Agreement between us and Rayonier Advanced Materials, Rayonier Advanced Materials has assumed any environmental liability of ours in connection with the manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations related to the Performance Fibers business and has agreed to indemnify and hold us harmless in connection with such environmental liabilities. However, in the event we seek indemnification from Rayonier Advanced Materials, we cannot provide any assurance that a court will enforce our indemnification right if challenged by Rayonier Advanced Materials or that Rayonier Advanced Materials will be able to fund any amounts for indemnification owed to us. In addition, the cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated timberlands and properties that we currently own or acquire in the future could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. We could also incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), clean-up and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations related to such timberlands or properties.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.The markets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we compete with companies that have substantially greater financial resources that we do in each of these businesses. The competitive pressures relating to our Timber segments are primarily driven by quantity of product supply and quality of the timber offered by competitors in the domestic and export markets, each of which may impact pricing. With respect to our Real Estate segment, we compete with other owners of entitled and unentitled properties. Each property has unique attributes, but overall quantity of supply and price for residential, commercial, industrial and rural properties in the geographic areas in which we operate are the most significant competitive drivers. The market in which our Trading segment operates remains very competitive with over 20 entities competing for export log supply at different ports across New Zealand.Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to make future acquisitions.We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, acquisitions of timberland and real estate properties that meet our investment criteria and achieve our strategic goals of growing the size and average quality of our land base. The ability to grow through acquisitions or other investments depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture partnerships. In addition, the discount rate we use in our acquisition underwriting has to meet our internal hurdle rate while also being competitive with that of other timberland REITs and TIMOs. In particular, our future success and growth depend upon our ability to make acquisitions that increase merchantable timber inventory and complement the existing age class structure of our ownership. If we are unable to make acquisitions on acceptable terms or that do not support our strategic goals, our revenues and cash flows may stagnate or decline. 15Our inability to access the capital markets could adversely affect our business and competitive position.Due to the REIT income distribution requirements, we rely significantly on external sources of capital to finance growth and acquisitions. Both our ability to obtain financing and the related costs of borrowing are affected by a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control, including a decline in general market conditions, decreased market liquidity, a downgrade to our public debt rating, increases in interest rates, an unfavorable market perception of our growth potential, a decrease in our current or estimated future earnings or a decrease in the market price of our common stock. If capital is not available when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms relative to other timberland REITs or TIMOs, or not at all, we may be unable to complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures. In July 2014, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (S&P) lowered our credit ratings, including our corporate credit rating, to “BBB” from “BBB+.” In November 2014, S&P further lowered our credit ratings to “BBB-.” As of December 31, 2014, our credit ratings from S&P and Moody’s Investors Service (Moody’s) were BBB- and Baa2, respectively. Any combination of the factors described above, including our failure to maintain our investment grade credit rating, could prevent us from obtaining the capital we require on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, liquidity and competitive position. Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the price of our common shares.One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as compared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect relative attractiveness of an investment in the Company and, accordingly, the price of our common shares.There are risks to the Company associated with the recently completed spin-off of our Performance Fibers business.The Company faces a number of risks related to the spin-off of our Performance Fibers business on June 27, 2014, including the following:•We may not achieve the expected benefits from the spin-off. After the spin-off, we believe that we will be able to, among other things, better focus our financial and operational resources, and design and implement corporate strategies and policies targeted toward our specific businesses, growth profile and strategic priorities, implement and maintain a capital structure designed to meet our specific needs and more effectively respond to industry dynamics. However, the Company may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off, and the spin-off could lead to disruption of our operations, loss of, or inability to recruit or retain, and key personnel needed to operate and grow our business. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a standalone company, or do not achieve them in a timely or cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.•Our business is less diversified. Our operational and financial profile has changed as a result of the spin-off of the Performance Fibers business. As a result, our diversification of revenue sources has diminished without the revenue previously generated by the Performance Fibers business, and it is possible that our results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility related to the timber business and the markets we serve. If we are unable to manage that volatility, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.We sponsor defined benefit pension plans, which cover a portion of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these benefit plans. At December 31, 2014, our qualified plan was underfunded by $32 million, but we are not subject to any pension contribution requirements in 2015. Because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, we cannot provide any assurance that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. Any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for additional information about these plans, including funding status. 16The impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, U.S. federal and state levels, remain uncertain at this time.There continue to be numerous international, U.S. federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions into the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use “cleaner” energy.In late 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” under the Clean Air Act with respect to certain greenhouse gases, leading to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act and having significant ramifications for Rayonier and the industry in general. In this regard, the EPA has published various regulations, affecting the operation of existing and new industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide. As a result of the EPA’s decision to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, states will now have to consider them in permitting new or modified facilities.Overall, it is reasonably likely that legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way affect Rayonier and the U.S. customers of our Southern Timber and Pacific Northwest Timber segments, but it is unclear at this time what the nature of the impact will be. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier, from a cost, benefit and financial performance standpoint remains uncertain at this time. In addition, the EPA has yet to finalize the treatment of biomass under greenhouse gas regulatory schemes leaving Rayonier’s biomass customers in a position of uncertainty.REIT and Tax-Related RisksIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholders because our REIT income will be subject to taxation.We intend to continue to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and related U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative guidance. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not within our control. We cannot assure that we will remain qualified as a REIT or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT or the U.S. federal income tax consequences of such qualification.We continually monitor and test our compliance with all REIT requirements. In particular, we regularly test our compliance with the REIT “asset tests,” which require generally that, at the close of each calendar quarter, (1) at least 75 percent of the market value of our total assets must consist of REIT-qualifying interests in real property (such as timberlands), including leaseholds and options to acquire real property and leaseholds, as well as cash and cash items and certain other specified assets and (2) no more than 25 percent of the market value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more “taxable REIT subsidiaries” or other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75 percent test in clause (1) above.If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income. In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer.As of December 31, 2014, Rayonier is in compliance with the asset tests described above. A failure to comply with the asset tests ultimately could cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT and to lose the associated benefits of REIT status, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay any resulting additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from “prohibited transactions.” In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of logs, and dealer sales of timberlands or other real estate, constitute prohibited transactions. 17We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that become part of our “dealer” real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we may be subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income, but not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not generally believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is generally treated as capital gains income. However, a REIT must pay corporate level tax on its undistributed taxable income and capital gains.Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be paid to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of the value of its outstanding shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent or more of the value of our outstanding shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. 18"
11,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2014-02-28,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Report. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.Business and Operating RisksThere are risks associated with the spin-off of our Performance Fibers business.The Company’s planned spin-off of its Performance Fibers business is subject to a number of risks, including the following:    •Risk of Non-Consummation. The Company expects the distribution of the common shares of the new company that was formed to hold the Performance Fibers business to occur in mid-2014.  However, the spin-off remains subject to a number of conditions, including: (i) final approval by the Company’s board of directors, (ii) receipt by the Company of a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS and (iii) the effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10 relating to the securities of the new Performance Fibers company. There can be no assurance that any or all of these conditions will be met and that the spin-off will be completed in the manner and timeframe currently contemplated, or at all.•Risk Relating to Resources. The execution of the proposed spin-off transaction will require significant time and attention from management, which may distract management from the operation of our businesses and the execution of our other initiatives. Our employees may also be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles with each of the separate companies pending the completion of the spin-off transaction. •Risks of Not Obtaining Benefits from the Spin-Off. The Company may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the spin-off, or may not achieve them in a timely fashion.     •Risks Relating to Less Diversification. If the spin-off is completed, the Company’s operational and financial profile will change as a result of the separation of the Performance Fibers business from the Company’s other businesses. As a result, the Company’s diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and it is possible that the Company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility.    The markets we operate in are subject to factors beyond our control.The end markets for our Forest Resources, Real Estate and Performance Fibers businesses are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For example, the demand for real estate can be affected by availability of capital, changes in interest rates, availability and terms of financing, local economic conditions, the employment rate, new housing starts, population growth and demographics. The demand for sawtimber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercial construction activity. Sawtimber pricing, while recently trending upward, continues to be below historic levels. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices. Both our Real Estate and Forest Resources businesses have been negatively impacted by the economic downturn, primarily due to the decline in housing starts, excess supply of existing housing inventory, above-normal unemployment and the tightening of credit availability for real estate and construction related projects.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.Our Performance Fibers business faces competition from domestic and foreign producers of high purity cellulose specialties and producers of products that can substitute for them in certain applications, such as cotton linters. Moreover, the entry of new competitors and the expansion of existing competitors could create excess capacity, which might cause us to lose sales or result in price reductions. For example, over the past 24 months some manufacturers of commodity viscose have publicly announced plans to convert facilities to manufacture, or claimed to have already commenced production of, high purity cellulose specialties that may compete with our products. In addition to our recently completed cellulose specialties expansion project, which added approximately 190,000 metric tons of cellulose specialties capacity, a few competitors have announced expansions of their capacity.  7Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsBuckeye Technologies recently completed a project to increase its cellulose specialties capacity by approximately 40,000 metric tons at its Perry, Florida operation. Tembec, Inc. announced plans to increase capacity by 15,000 metric tons. We also believe that Sateri Holdings Ltd. increased capacity 5,000 to 10,000 metric tons per year over the past three years. Although the Performance Fibers business plans to gradually increase production in line with demand, the additional capacity could adversely affect product pricing. Actions by our competitors and any excess production capacity could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In our Forest Resources business, competitive pressures are primarily driven by quantity of product supply and quality of the timber offered by competitors in the domestic and export markets, each of which may impact pricing.With respect to our Real Estate business, we compete with other owners of entitled and unentitled properties. Each property has unique attributes, but overall quantity of supply and price for residential, commercial, industrial and rural properties in the geographic areas in which we operate are the most significant competitive drivers.We are dependent on a relatively few large customers for a majority of our Performance Fibers sales.  The loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to any of these large customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company.We are subject to risks related to customer concentration because of the relative importance of our largest customers, many of whom have been doing business with Rayonier for decades, and the ability of those customers to influence pricing and other contract terms. We depend on major acetate tow manufacturers for a substantial portion of our sales. Our five largest customers, which account for approximately 70 percent of sales from our Performance Fibers business, are all either well known global diversified specialty chemical companies or state owned enterprises. Although we strive to broaden and diversify our customer base, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively small number of large-volume customers, and the loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to any of these customers, or significant unfavorable changes to pricing or terms contained in our contracts with them, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are also subject to credit risk associated with this customer concentration. If one or more of our largest customers were to become bankrupt, insolvent or otherwise were unable to pay for its products, we may incur significant write-offs of accounts that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our Performance Fibers business is exposed to risks associated with the cyclicality of the business of certain of our customers, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.Some of the industries in which our end-use customers participate, such as the construction, automotive and textile industries, are cyclical in nature, thus posing a risk to us which is beyond our control. The industries in which these customers participate are highly competitive, to a large extent driven by end-use applications, and may experience overcapacity or reductions in demand, all of which may affect demand for and pricing of our products. The consequences of this could include the reduction, delay or cancellation of customer orders, and bankruptcy of customers, suppliers or other creditors. The occurrence of any of these events may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.Changes in raw material and manufacturing input prices could affect our results of operations and financial condition.Raw material costs and energy, such as wood, chemicals, oil and natural gas are a significant operating expense, particularly for the Performance Fibers business. The costs of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, caustic soda, a key manufacturing input for Performance Fibers, has historically had significant price volatility. The price of oil has also substantially increased in recent years, and we have, at times, experienced limited availability of hardwood, primarily due to wet weather conditions which can limit harvesting, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in our Forest Resources business, the rising cost of fuel, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation for our products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third party logging and trucking services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We depend on third parties for transportation services and increases in costs and the availability of transportation could adversely affect our business.Our business depends on transportation services provided by third parties, both domestically and internationally. We rely on these providers for transportation of the products that we manufacture as well as delivery of our raw materials to our manufacturing facilities. A significant portion of the products we manufacture and raw materials we use are transported in the United States by railroad or trucks, and internationally by ship. 8Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIf any of our transportation providers were to fail to deliver the goods that we manufacture in a timely manner, or damaged them during transport, we may be unable to sell those products at full value, or at all. Similarly, if any of these providers were to fail to deliver raw materials to us in a timely manner, we may be unable to timely manufacture our products in response to customer demand.Any significant failure of third-party transportation providers to deliver raw materials or finished products could harm our reputation, negatively affect our customer relationships and adversely affect our business. In addition, increases in transportation rates or fuel costs could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.A material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand, reduce our sales or adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.Any of our manufacturing facilities, or a part of any particular facility, could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events, including:•unscheduled maintenance outages;•prolonged power failures;•equipment failure;•a chemical spill or release;•explosion of a boiler or other pressure vessel;•fires, floods, windstorms, earthquakes, hurricanes or other catastrophes;•terrorism or threats of terrorism; and•other operational problems.Furthermore, depending on the nature, extent and length of any operational interruption due to any such event, the results could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Future tobacco legislation, campaigns to discourage smoking, increases in tobacco taxes, increased costs of tobacco products and increased use of non-filtered substitutes could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The majority of our Performance Fibers are used to manufacture acetate tow, the filter component of a cigarette. Our sales for this end-use have historically accounted for an important portion of our total sales revenue. Significant increases in cigarette costs and potential actions taken by the United States and other countries to discourage smoking, such as tax increases on tobacco products and, future legislation, may have a material adverse effect on the demand for tobacco products. Additionally, increased use of e-cigarettes or smokeless tobacco products may affect demand for cigarettes. Reduced sales of tobacco products that use acetate-based filters could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.Although the majority of our business is to customers in the United States, a significant portion of our sales, in particular in the Performance Fibers business, are to customer locations outside of the United States, including China, the European Union and other international markets. The export of our products into international markets results in risks that are inherent in conducting business under international laws, regulations and customs. Sales to customers outside of the United States made up approximately 58 percent of our revenue in fiscal year 2013. We expect that international sales will continue to contribute to future growth. The risks associated with our business outside the United States include:•changes in and reinterpretations of the laws, regulations and enforcement priorities of the countries in which we sell our products;•responsibility to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;•trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements; •difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-U.S. operations;•product damage or losses incurred during shipping;•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;•political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;•economic instability, inflation, recessions and interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations; 9Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•uncertainties regarding non-U.S. judicial systems, rules and procedures; and•minimal or limited protection of intellectual property in some countries.These risks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.A Chinese anti-dumping investigation has resulted in preliminary duties on our lower purity commodity viscose products, which could affect sales of the products into China. In February 2013, China’s Ministry of Commerce (“MOFCOM”) notified the Company and a number of other parties that it had commenced an anti-dumping investigation into imports of dissolving, cotton and bamboo pulp into China from the United States, Canada and Brazil during 2012. In November 2013, MOFCOM issued its preliminary determination in respect of its investigation. Pursuant to the preliminary determination, our lower purity commodity viscose, which is primarily utilized to produce viscose staple fiber for use in the manufacture of fabrics, was assessed an interim duty of 21.7 percent, effective November 7, 2013. The Company’s high-value cellulose acetate products were specifically excluded from assessment of any dumping duty, and our other high-value cellulose products were, likewise, exempted from any dumping duty.The Company has challenged the basis of MOFCOM’s duty calculation for commodity viscose, and is evaluating other potential commercial and legal options. MOFCOM’s final determination is expected in the second quarter of 2014 and would be expected to remain in place for five years. If the final determination retains the duty level for our Performance Fibers business set by the preliminary determination, the duty would have an adverse effect on the sales of commodity viscose into China by the Company.Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change, and new laws and regulations are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturing facilities, remediate contaminated properties and/or entitle real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands and endangered species, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air emissions, wastewater discharges, receiving water quality, timber harvesting practices, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Moreover, environmental policies of the current administration are in the aggregate more restrictive for industry and landowners than those of the previous administration. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has pursued a number of initiatives that, if implemented, could impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like those of Rayonier, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and stormwater control. In 2013, the EPA issued final regulations that significantly tighten emissions limits of certain air pollutants from industrial boilers, which will result in our expenditure of significant capital for compliance. In addition, as a result of certain recent judicial rulings and EPA initiatives, including some that would require timberland operators to obtain permits to carry out certain ordinary course forestry activities, silvicultural practices on our timberlands could be impacted in the future. Environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. In connection with a variety of operations on our properties, we are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Forest Resources business, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizen groups. Appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In our Performance Fibers businesses, many modifications and capital projects at our manufacturing facilities require one or more environmental permits, or amendments to existing permits. Delays in obtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Our Performance Fibers mills are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits that may limit operations and production. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits that contain conditions governing how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant  10Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementscosts on our operations with respect to environmental compliance.  It is expected that, overall, costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands, and operate mills. For example, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. Also, interveners at times may bring legal action in Florida in opposition to entitlement and change of use of timberlands to commercial, industrial or residential use. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands, affect how we operate or limit our ability to modify or invest in our mills. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands, or adversely affecting the timing, projected operating benefits or cost of capital projects at our mills.The impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the area subject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near our timberlands, including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, Red Hills salamander and flatwoods salamander in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act or similar federal and state laws. Other species, such as the gopher tortoise are currently under review for possible protection. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.Our Performance Fibers mills are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits which contain conditions that govern how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.We currently own or may acquire properties that may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations that it does not currently own, and may acquire timberlands and other properties in the future, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. For more detail, see Note 17 — Liabilities for Dispositions and Discontinued Operations. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we currently have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediation of our properties, legal requirements relating to assessment and remediation of these properties continue to become more stringent and there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed expectations, or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future. We have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant capital, operating and other expenditures complying with applicable environmental laws and regulations and as a result of remedial obligations. We could also incur substantial costs, such as civil or criminal fines, sanctions and enforcement actions (including orders limiting our operations or requiring corrective measures, installation of pollution control equipment or other remedial actions), clean-up and closure costs, and third-party claims for property damage and personal injury as a result of violations of, or liabilities under, environmental laws and regulations.Entitlement and development of real estate entail a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process.Entitlement and development of real estate entail extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is common for a project to require multiple approvals, permits and consents from federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the “Growth Management Act”) and local land use and  11Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsdevelopment regulations. In addition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (“DRI”) application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, local land development regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands may require one or more permits from the federal government. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost and timing of our real estate projects.The real estate entitlement process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. A significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, water availability, transportation and other infrastructure and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Growth Management Act and DRI process. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, in filing litigation to oppose particular entitlement activities and development projects, and in seeking legislation and other anti-growth limitations on real estate development activities.  We expect that this type of anti-growth activity may continue in the future.Issues affecting real estate development also include the availability of potable water for new development projects. For example, in Georgia, the Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act, which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the I-95 coastal corridor in southern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings.  Concerns about the availability of potable water also exists in certain Florida counties, which could impact growth.Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs and delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.Changes in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.A number of factors, including changes in demographics, tightening of credit, high unemployment and a slowing of commercial or residential real estate development, particularly along the I-95 coastal corridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for our properties and negatively affect our results of operations.In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factors beyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results.The impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, federal and state levels, remain uncertain at this time.There continue to be numerous international, federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the United States, most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases” to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more “clean energy.”In late 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” under the Clear Air Act with respect to certain greenhouse gases, and this finding could lead to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a criteria pollutant under the Clean Air Act and have significant ramifications for Rayonier and the industry in general. In this regard, the EPA has published various proposed regulations, which are currently subject to numerous legal challenges, affecting the operation of existing and new industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide.  In addition, as a result of the EPA’s decision to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, the states will now have to consider them in permitting new or modified facilities.Overall, it is reasonably likely that legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way affect Rayonier, but it is unclear at this time whether such impact will be, in the aggregate, positive, negative, neutral or material. For example, while Rayonier’s Performance Fibers mills produce greenhouse gases and utilize fossil fuels, they also generate a substantial amount of their energy from wood fiber (often referred to as “biomass”), which may be viewed more favorably than fossil fuels in future legislative and regulatory proposals, but that is uncertain at this time. However, to date, many environmental groups have generally opposed the use of biomass for energy production due to their concerns about deforestation. We continue to monitor political and  12Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsregulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier, from a cost, benefit and financial performance standpoint, remains uncertain at this time.Investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our benefit plans.We sponsor several defined benefit pension plans, which cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these benefit plans. Because it is unknown what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. Any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for additional information about these plans, including funding status.Our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.We participate in a joint venture in New Zealand, and may enter into other joint venture projects; for example, as part of our real estate strategy. A joint venture involves potential risks such as:•not having voting control over the joint venture; •the venture partners at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; •the venture partners may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the investment; and, •the venture partners could experience financial difficulties.Actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the joint venture agreement or to other adverse consequences.Our Performance Fibers business exposes us to potential product liability claims, which could adversely affect our financial condition and performance.The development, manufacture and sale of cellulose specialties by Rayonier, including products manufactured for use by the food, cigarette, automotive, and pharmaceutical industries, involves a risk of exposure to product liability claims, and related adverse publicity. A product liability claim or judgment against us could also result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, affect confidence in our products, and divert management’s attention from other responsibilities. Although we maintain product liability insurance, there can be no assurance that this type or the level of coverage is adequate or that we will be able to continue to maintain our existing insurance or obtain comparable insurance at a reasonable cost, if at all. A partially or completely uninsured judgment against us could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Although we have standard contracting policies and controls, we may not always be able to contractually limit our exposure to third-party claims should our failure to perform result in downstream supply disruptions or product recalls.The inability to make or effectively integrate future acquisitions may affect our results.As part of our growth strategy, we may pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses and product lines and land, and invest in joint ventures. The ability to grow through acquisitions or other investments depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable acquisitions or joint venture arrangements. If we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions into our existing business, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.Our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.As of December 31, 2013, approximately 55 percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are exclusively in our Performance Fibers business. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with these employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. If our unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, collective bargaining agreements at our Fernandina Beach, Florida mill expire on April 30, 2014, and negotiations are expected to begin shortly. 13Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWeather and other natural conditions may increase the prices of and reduce access to raw materials.We use large quantities of wood as a raw material in our fiber manufacturing process. Weather conditions, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access to timberlands for harvesting (for example, due to prolonged wet conditions) may limit the availability and increase the price of wood, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes.Raw materials are available from a number of suppliers and we have not historically experienced material supply interruptions or substantial sustained price increases; however, our requirements for certain raw materials, such as wood, may increase as a result of the recent Jesup mill expansion. As a result, we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us during times of tight supply caused by weather and other natural conditions. An insufficient supply of wood could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.Weather conditions, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access may limit harvesting of our timberlands, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes.We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire.The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire, insect infestation, severe weather, disease, natural disasters and other causes beyond our control. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to these causes.A significant portion of the timberland that we own, lease or manage is concentrated in limited geographic areas.We own, lease or manage approximately 2.6 million acres of timberland and real estate located primarily in the United States and New Zealand. Approximately 79 percent of our U.S. timberlands are located in four states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Washington. Accordingly, if the level of production from these forests substantially declines, or if the demand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues.We are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel, the loss of whom could adversely affect our business.We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.Failure to protect our intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth.We rely on process knowledge, confidentiality agreements and internal security measures to protect our trade secrets and other intellectual property, particularly in our Performance Fibers business. Failure to protect this intellectual property could negatively affect our future performance and growth.Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the price of our common shares.One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as compared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common shares.We have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt.As of December 31, 2013, we had $1.6 billion of debt outstanding. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Financial Obligations for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if we enter into one or more strategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. 14Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsREIT and Tax-Related RisksIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholders because our REIT income will be subject to taxation.We intend to continue to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and related U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative guidance. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not within our control. We cannot assure that we will remain qualified as a REIT or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.We continually monitor and test our compliance with all REIT requirements. In particular, we regularly test our compliance with the REIT “asset tests,” which require generally that, at the close of each calendar quarter, (1) at least 75 percent of the market value of our total assets must consist of REIT-qualifying interests in real property (such as timberlands), including leaseholds and options to acquire real property and leaseholds, as well as cash and cash items and certain other specified assets and (2) no more than 25 percent of the market value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more “taxable REIT subsidiaries” or other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75 percent test in clause (1) above. It should be noted, however, that under the applicable REIT requirements, mere fluctuation of the relative values of a REIT’s assets from one period to the next, without the occurrence of one or more specific events described in the Code and applicable REIT regulations, does not require a revaluation of those assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests.If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income. In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer.As of December 31, 2013 and as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Rayonier is in compliance with the asset tests described above. A failure to comply with the asset tests ultimately could cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT and to lose the associated benefits of REIT status, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay the additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.The extent of our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of cellulose specialty fibers, non-passive real estate activities including dealer sale of HBU property and other real estate, and the sale of logs. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level income tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use taxable REIT subsidiaries as extensively as we use them.Our status as a REIT may affect our ability to expand our taxable REIT subsidiaries’ operations.Taxable REIT subsidiaries are limited in size based upon a REIT’s real estate assets. Under the Code, no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be comprised of securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries’ operations and, in particular, our Performance Fibers business.Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of the value of its outstanding shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent or more of the value of our outstanding shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. 15Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe may be limited in our ability to fund shareholder distributions using cash generated from our taxable REIT subsidiaries’ operations.The ability of the REIT to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited by provisions of the Code. Specifically, at least 75 percent of a REIT’s annual gross income must be derived from passive real estate rents, royalties and gains including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other passive non-real estate income. This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries may impact our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We can, however, under current law, issue stock dividends for up to 80 percent of our regular dividend distribution. Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from “prohibited transactions.” In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of cellulose specialty fibers which we produce and sales of logs constitute prohibited transactions. In addition, dealer sales of timberlands or other real estate constitute prohibited transactions.We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that become part of our “dealer” real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we face the potential of being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income, but not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not generally believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is generally treated as capital gains income. However, a REIT must pay corporate level tax on its undistributed capital gains. Our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate. "
0,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2013-02-26,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Report. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.Business and Operating RisksThe markets we operate in are subject to factors beyond our control.The end markets for our Forest Resources, Real Estate, Performance Fibers and Wood Products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For example, the demand for real estate can be affected by availability of capital, changes in interest rates, availability and terms of financing, local economic conditions, the employment rate, new housing starts, population growth and demographics. The demand for sawtimber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercial construction activity. Sawtimber pricing, while recently trending upward, continues to be below historic levels. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices. Both our Real Estate and Forest Resources businesses have been negatively impacted by the economic downturn, primarily due to the decline in housing starts, excess supply of existing housing inventory, above-normal unemployment and the tightening of credit availability for real estate and construction related projects. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.In our Performance Fibers business, we face competition from domestic and foreign producers. In addition, some manufacturers of pulp have announced plans to convert facilities for, or claimed to have already commenced production of, high purity dissolving pulps that may compete with our products. Competition may also arise from the threat of substitute products.In our Forest Resources business, competitive pressures are primarily driven by quantity of product supply and quality of the timber offered by competitors in the domestic and export markets, each of which may impact pricing.With respect to our Real Estate business, we compete with other owners of entitled and unentitled properties. Each property has unique attributes, but overall quantity of supply and price for residential, commercial, industrial and rural properties in the geographic areas in which we operate are the most significant competitive drivers.In Wood Products, significant competition arises from competitive domestic producers and a variety of non-wood and engineered products and imported lumber (particularly from Canada).Changes in energy and raw material prices could impact our operating results and financial condition.Energy and raw material costs, such as oil, natural gas, wood and chemicals, are a significant operating expense, particularly for the Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses. The prices of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, caustic soda, a key raw material for Performance Fibers, has historically had significant price volatility. Oil and natural gas costs have also substantially increased in recent years and we have, at times, experienced limited availability of hardwood, primarily due to wet weather conditions which impact harvesting and result in increased costs for some Performance Fibers products. Increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in our Forest Resources, Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, the rising cost of fuel, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation for our products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third party logging and trucking services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in global economic conditions, market trends and world events could impact customer demand.The global reach of our businesses, particularly the Performance Fibers business, timber sales for export markets from Washington and our interest in the JV, subjects us to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances, such as those that may result from the current volatile state of the global economic and financial market situation, in addition to those experienced in the U.S. Adverse changes in the following factors, among others, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations: •exposure to fluctuations in currencies other than the United States dollar; 6Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•regulatory, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and, •trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, imposition of new tariffs and duties and import and export licensing requirements.Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturing facilities, remediate contaminated properties and/or entitle real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands and endangered species, timber harvesting practices, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Moreover, environmental policies of the current administration are in the aggregate more restrictive for industry and landowners than those of the previous administration. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has pursued a number of initiatives which could, if implemented, impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like those of Rayonier, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and stormwater control. In another example, the EPA recently issued final regulations which significantly tighten emissions limits of certain air pollutants from industrial boilers. In addition, as a result of certain recent judicial rulings and EPA initiatives, including some that would require timberland operators to obtain permits to carry out certain ordinary course forestry activities, silvicultural practices on our timberlands could be impacted in the future. Nonetheless, irrespective of any particular presidential administration, environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results.If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. In connection with a variety of operations on our properties, we are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Forest Resources business, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizen groups. Appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In our Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, many modifications and capital projects at our manufacturing facilities require one or more environmental permits, or amendments to existing permits. Delays in obtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands, and operate mills. For example, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. Also, interveners at times may bring legal action in Florida in opposition to entitlement and change of use of timberlands to commercial, industrial or residential use. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining terms and conditions of proposed permits issued to us by regulatory agencies, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands, impact how we operate or limit our ability to modify or invest in our mills. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands, or adversely affecting the timing, projected operating benefits or cost of capital projects at our mills.The impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the area subject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near 7Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsour timberlands, including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, Red Hills salamander and flatwoods salamander in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act or similar federal and state laws. Other species, such as the gopher tortoise are currently under review for possible protection. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.Our Performance Fibers and Wood Products mills are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits which contain conditions that govern how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.We currently own or may acquire properties which may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations, or may acquire timberlands and other properties, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater  contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. For more detail, see Note 15 — Liabilities for Dispositions and Discontinued Operations. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we currently have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediation of our properties, legal requirements relating to assessment and remediation of these properties continue to become more stringent and there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations, or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future.Entitlement and development of real estate entail a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process.Entitlement and development of real estate entail extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is common for a project to require multiple approvals, permits and consents from federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the ""Growth Management Act"") and local land use and development regulations. In addition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (""DRI"") application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, local land development regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands may require one or more permits from the federal government. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost and timing of our real estate projects.The real estate entitlement process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. A significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, water availability, transportation and other infrastructure and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Growth Management Act and DRI process. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, in filing litigation to oppose particular entitlement activities and development projects, and in seeking legislation and other anti-growth limitations on real estate development activities.  We expect that this type of anti-growth activity may continue in the future.Issues affecting real estate development also include the availability of potable water for new development projects. For example, in Georgia, the Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act, which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the I-95 coastal corridor in southern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings.  Concerns about the availability of potable water also exists in certain Florida counties, which could impact growth.Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs and delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.8Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChanges in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.A number of factors, including changes in demographics, tightening of credit, high unemployment and a slowing of commercial or residential real estate development, particularly along the I-95 coastal corridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for our properties and negatively affect our results of operations. The decline in the housing market together with the tightening of real estate lending standards and availability had a negative effect in 2012. Although indicators of the beginning of a recovery exist, these factors are expected to continue to impact 2013 results. In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factors beyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results.The impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, federal and state levels, remain uncertain at this time.There continues to be numerous international, federal and state-level initiatives and proposals to address domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more ""clean energy."" In 2013, we believe the potential for climate change legislation at the federal level to be unlikely.In late 2009, the EPA issued an ""endangerment finding"" under the Clear Air Act (""CAA"") with respect to certain greenhouse gases, which could lead to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a criteria pollutant under the CAA and have significant ramifications for Rayonier and the industry in general. In this regard, the EPA has published various proposed regulations, which are currently subject to numerous legal challenges, affecting the operation of existing and new industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide. In addition, as a result of the EPA's decision to regulate greenhouse gases under the CAA, the states will now have to consider them in permitting new or modified facilities.Overall, it is likely that future legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way impact Rayonier, but it is unclear at this time whether such impact will be, in the aggregate, positive or negative, or material. For example, while Rayonier’s Performance Fibers mills produce greenhouses gases and utilize fossil fuels, they also generate a substantial amount of their energy from wood fiber (often referred to as ""biomass""), which may be viewed more favorably than fossil fuels in future legislative and  regulatory proposals, but that is uncertain at this time. However, environmental groups have generally opposed the use of biomass for energy production due to their concerns about deforestation. Our extensive timber holdings and the biomass they produce may provide opportunities for us to benefit from new legislation and regulation, especially due to the potential benefits available from carbon capture and sequestration opportunities, sale of ""carbon credits"" and ""renewable portfolio standards"" that mandate the use of non-fossil fuels by electricity generators, which could lead to increased demand for biomass products from our forests. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier, from a cost, benefit and financial performance standpoint, remains uncertain at this time.Investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our plans.We sponsor several defined benefit pension plans, which cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these plans. Because it is unknown  what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that applicable law will not require us to make future material plan contributions. Any such contributions could adversely affect our financial condition. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for additional information about these plans, including funded status.Our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.We participate in a joint venture in New Zealand, and may enter into other joint venture projects; for example, as part of our real estate strategy. A joint venture involves potential risks such as: •not having voting control over the joint venture; •the venture partners at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; •the venture partners may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the investment; and, •the venture partners could experience financial difficulties.9Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsActions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the joint venture agreement or to other adverse consequences.We may be delayed or unsuccessful in completing our cellulose specialties expansion project.In 2011, we announced a major expansion of our Jesup, Georgia facility, whereby we plan to increase our cellulose specialties production capacity by about 190,000 tons per year. We expect to complete construction of this project and also exit the absorbent materials (i.e., fluff pulp) business in 2013. In the event that completion of the project is significantly delayed or unsuccessful, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be unsuccessful in carrying out our land acquisition strategy.We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, acquisitions of timberland and real estate properties that meet our investment criteria. Our timberland and real estate acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. We anticipate financing any such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, the use of equity, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. The failure to identify and complete suitable timberland and real estate property acquisitions, and the failure of any acquisitions to perform to our expectations, could adversely affect our operating results.Our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.Approximately 48 percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are exclusively in our Performance Fibers business. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with these employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. For example, as discussed in Item 1 - Business, our collective bargaining agreement at our Jesup, Georgia facility expired on June 30, 2012. While negotiations continue, if the unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.Weather conditions, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access may limit harvesting of our timberlands, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes.We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire.The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire, insect infestation, severe weather, disease, natural disasters and other causes beyond our control. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to these causes.A significant portion of the timberland that we own, lease or manage is concentrated in limited geographic areas.We own, lease or manage approximately 2.7 million acres of timberland and real estate located primarily in the United States and New Zealand. Approximately 75 percent of our timberlands are located in four states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and Washington. Accordingly, if the level of production from these forests substantially declines, or if the demand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues.We are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel, the loss of whom could adversely affect our business.We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Increases in market interest rates may adversely affect the price of our common shares.One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as compared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common shares.10Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt.As of December 31, 2012, we had $1.3 billion of debt outstanding. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Financial Obligations for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, cash provided from operations and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if we enter into one or more strategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. REIT and Tax-Related RisksIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholders because our REIT income will be subject to taxation.We intend to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), and related U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative guidance. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not within our control. We cannot assure that we will remain qualified as a REIT or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.We continually monitor and test our compliance with all REIT requirements. In particular, we regularly test our compliance with the REIT “asset tests,” which require generally that, at the close of each calendar quarter, (1) at least 75% of the market value of our total assets must consist of REIT-qualifying interests in real property (such as timberlands), including leaseholds and options to acquire real property and leaseholds, as well as cash and cash items and certain other specified assets and (2) no more than 25% of the market value of our total assets may consist of the securities of one or more “taxable REIT subsidiaries” or other assets that are not qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% test in clause (1) above. It should be noted, however, that under the applicable REIT requirements, mere fluctuation of the relative values of a REIT's assets from one period to the next, without the occurrence of one or more specific events described in the Code and applicable REIT regulations, does not require a revaluation of those assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests.If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income. In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer.As of December 31, 2012 and as of the date of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, Rayonier is in compliance with the asset tests described above. We are aware, however, that the continued growth of our Performance Fibers business, which consists of non-qualifying assets that we hold through our taxable REIT subsidiary, could raise issues with respect to future compliance with the asset tests described above. A failure to comply with the asset tests ultimately could cause us to fail to qualify as a REIT and to lose the associated benefits of REIT status, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay the additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.The extent of our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of performance fibers and wood products, non-passive real estate activities including dealer sale of HBU property and other real estate and the sale of logs. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level income tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use taxable REIT subsidiaries as extensively as we use them.Our status as a REIT may affect our ability to expand our taxable REIT subsidiaries' operations.Taxable REIT subsidiaries are limited in size based upon a REIT's real estate assets. Under the Code, no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be comprised of securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries' operations and, in particular, our Performance Fibers 11Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementsbusiness.Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of the value of its outstanding shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent or more of the value of our outstanding shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.We may be limited in our ability to fund shareholder distributions using cash generated from our taxable REIT subsidiaries' operations.The ability of the REIT to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited by provisions of the Code. Specifically, at least 75 percent of a REIT's annual gross income must be derived from passive real estate rents, royalties and gains including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other passive non-real estate income. This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries may impact our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We can, however, under current law, issue stock dividends for up to 80 percent of our regular dividend distribution. Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from ""prohibited transactions."" In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of performance fibers and wood products which we produce and sales of logs constitute prohibited transactions. In addition, dealer sales of timberlands or other real estate constitute prohibited transactions.We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that become part of our ""dealer"" real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we face the potential of being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income, but not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. However, a REIT must pay corporate level tax on its undistributed capital gains. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate. "
9,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2012-02-28,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORSOur operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Report. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.Business and Operating RisksThe markets we operate in are subject to factors beyond our control.The end markets for our Forest Resources, Real Estate, Performance Fibers and Wood Products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For example, the demand for real estate can be affected by availability of capital, changes in interest rates, availability and terms of financing, local economic conditions, the employment rate, new housing starts, population growth and demographics. The demand for sawtimber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercial construction activity. Sawtimber pricing continues to be below historic levels. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices. Both our Real Estate and Forest Resources businesses have been negatively impacted by the current economic downturn, primarily due to the decline in housing starts, excess supply of existing housing inventory, unemployment and the tightening of credit availability for real estate and construction related projects. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive.In our Performance Fibers business, we face competition from domestic and foreign producers. In addition, some manufacturers of pulp recently announced plans to convert facilities for, or claimed to have already commenced production of, high purity dissolving pulps that may compete with our products. Examples include mills in Washington and Canada. Competition also arises from the threat of substitute products.In our Forest Resources business, competitive pressures are primarily driven by product supply and quality of the timber offered by competitors in the domestic and export markets, each of which may impact pricing.With respect to our Real Estate business, we compete with other owners of entitled and unentitled properties. Each property has unique attributes, but overall supply and price for residential, commercial, industrial and rural properties in the geographic areas in which we operate are the most significant competitive drivers.In Wood Products, significant competition arises from a variety of non-wood and engineered products, imported lumber (particularly from Canada) and competitive domestic producers.Changes in energy and raw material prices could impact our operating results and financial condition.Energy and raw material costs, such as oil, natural gas, wood and chemicals, are a significant operating expense, particularly for the Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses. The prices of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control, such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, caustic soda, a key raw material for Performance Fibers, has historically had significant price volatility. Oil and natural gas costs have also substantially increased in recent years and we have, at times, experienced limited availability of hardwood, primarily due to wet weather conditions which impact harvesting and result in increased costs for some Performance Fibers products. Increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in our Forest Resources, Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, the rising cost of fuel, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation for our products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third party logging and trucking services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in global economic conditions, market trends and world events could impact customer demand.The global reach of our businesses, particularly the Performance Fibers business and our interest in the New Zealand JV, causes us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition to those experienced in the U.S. The current global economic and financial market situation is an example of such changes. Adverse changes in the following factors, among others, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations: •exposure to currencies other than the United States dollar; 6Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•regulatory, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and, •trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs, and import and export licensing requirements.Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturing facilities, remediate contaminated properties and/or entitle real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands and endangered species, timber harvesting practices, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Moreover, environmental policies of the current administration are in the aggregate more restrictive for industry and landowners than those of the previous administration. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") has pursued a number of initiatives which could, if implemented, impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like those of Rayonier, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and stormwater control. In another example, the EPA recently issued proposed regulations which significantly tighten emissions limits of certain air pollutants from industrial boilers. In addition, as a result of certain recent judicial rulings and EPA initiatives, including some that would require timberland operators to obtain permits to carry out certain ordinary course forestry activities, silvicultural practices on our timberlands could be impacted in the future. Nonetheless, irrespective of any particular presidential administration, environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results.If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. In connection with a variety of operations on our properties, we are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Forest Resources business, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizen groups. Appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In our Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, many modifications and capital projects at our manufacturing facilities require one or more environmental permits, or amendments to existing permits. Delays in obtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands, and operate mills. For example, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. Also, interveners at times may bring legal action in Florida in opposition to entitlement and change of use of timberlands to commercial, industrial or residential use. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands, impact how we operate or limit our ability to modify or invest in our mills. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands, or adversely affecting the timing, projected operating benefits or cost of capital projects at our mills.The impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the area subject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near our timberlands, including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, Red Hills salamander and flatwoods salamander in the 7Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsSoutheast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act or similar federal and state laws. Other species, such as the gopher tortoise, are currently under review for possible protection. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.Our Performance Fibers and Wood Products mills are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits which contain conditions that govern how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.We currently own or may acquire properties which may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations, or may acquire timberlands and other properties, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater  contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. For more detail, see Note 15 — Liabilities for Dispositions and Discontinued Operations. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we currently have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediation of our properties, legal requirements relating to assessment and remediation of these properties continue to become more stringent and there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations, or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future.Entitlement and development of real estate entail a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process.Entitlement and development of real estate entail extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is common for a project to require multiple approvals, permits and consents from federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the ""Growth Management Act"") and local land use and development regulations. In addition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (""DRI"") application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, local land development regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands may require one or more permits from the federal government. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost and timing of our real estate projects.The real estate entitlement process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. A significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, water availability, transportation and other infrastructure and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Growth Management Act and DRI process. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, in filing litigation to oppose particular entitlement activities and development projects, and in seeking legislation and other anti-growth limitations on real estate development activities.  We expect that this type of anti-growth activity may continue in the future.Issues affecting real estate development also include the availability of potable water for new development projects. For example, in Georgia, the Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act, which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the I-95 coastal corridor in southern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings.  Concerns about the availability of potable water also exists in certain Florida counties, which could impact growth.Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs and delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.8Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsChanges in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.A number of factors, including changes in demographics, tightening of credit, high unemployment and a slowing of commercial or residential real estate development, particularly along the I-95 coastal corridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for our properties and negatively affect our results of operations. The current decline in the housing market in particular, together with the tightening of real estate lending standards and availability, certainly had such an effect in 2011 and is expected to continue into 2012. In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factors beyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results.The impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, federal and state levels, remain uncertain at this time.Currently, there are numerous international, federal and state-level initiatives and proposals addressing domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide and other ""greenhouse gases"" to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more ""clean energy."" In 2012, we believe the potential for climate change legislation at the federal level to be unlikely.In late 2009, the EPA issued an ""endangerment finding"" under the Clear Air Act (""CAA"") with respect to certain greenhouse gases, which could lead to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a criteria pollutant under the CAA and have significant ramifications for Rayonier and the industry in general. In this regard, the EPA has published various proposed regulations, which are currently subject to numerous legal challenges, affecting the operation of existing and new industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide. In addition, as a result of the EPA's decision to regulate greenhouse gases under the CAA, the states will now have to consider them in permitting new or modified facilities.On the international front, various efforts, including the United Nations-sponsored Cancun, Mexico conference in December 2010, did not result in a binding agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.Overall, it is likely that future legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way impact Rayonier, but it is unclear at this time whether such impact will be, in the aggregate, positive or negative, or material. For example, while Rayonier’s Performance Fibers mills produce greenhouses gases and utilize fossil fuels, they also generate a substantial amount of their energy from wood fiber (often referred to as ""biomass""), which may be viewed more favorably than fossil fuels in future legislative and  regulatory proposals, but that is uncertain at this time. However, environmental groups have generally opposed the use of biomass for energy production due to their concerns about deforestation. Our extensive timber holdings and the biomass they produce may provide opportunities for us to benefit from new legislation and regulation, especially due to the potential benefits available from carbon capture and sequestration opportunities, sale of ""carbon credits"" and ""renewable portfolio standards"" that mandate the use of non-fossil fuels by electricity generators, which could lead to increased demand for biomass products from our forests. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier, from a cost, benefit and financial performance standpoint, remains uncertain at this time.Investment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected or interest rates may decline, requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our plans.We sponsor several defined benefit pension plans, which cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these plans. Because it is unknown  what the investment return on pension assets will be in future years or what interest rates may be at any point in time, no assurances can be given that future plan contributions required by applicable law will not be material. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates for additional information about these plans, including funded status.Our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.We participate in a joint venture in New Zealand, and may enter into other joint venture projects; for example, as part of our real estate strategy. A joint venture involves potential risks such as: •not having voting control over the joint venture; •the venture partners at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours; •the venture partners may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the investment; and, 9Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements•the venture partners could experience financial difficulties.Actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the joint venture agreement or to other adverse consequences.We may be delayed or unsuccessful in completing our cellulose specialties expansion project.In 2011, we announced a major expansion of our Jesup, Georgia facility, whereby we plan to increase our cellulose specialties production capacity by about 190,000 tons per year. We expect to complete construction of this project and also exit the absorbent materials (i.e., fluff pulp) business in 2013. In the event that completion of the project is significantly delayed or unsuccessful, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.We may be unsuccessful in carrying out our land acquisition strategy.We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, acquisitions of timberland and real estate properties that meet our investment criteria. Our timberland and real estate acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. We anticipate financing any such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, the use of equity, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. The failure to identify and complete suitable timberland and real estate property acquisitions, and the failure of any acquisitions to perform to our expectations, could adversely affect our operating results.Our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.Approximately 47 percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are exclusively in our Performance Fibers business. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with these employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. For example, as discussed in Item 1 - Business, our collective bargaining agreement at Jesup expires on June 30, 2012. If the unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.Weather conditions, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access may limit harvesting of our timberlands, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes.We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire.The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire, insect infestation, severe weather, disease, natural disasters and other causes beyond our control. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to these causes.A significant portion of the timberland that we own, lease or manage is concentrated in limited geographic areas.We own, lease or manage approximately 2.7 million acres of timberland and real estate located primarily in the United States and New Zealand. Approximately 68 percent of our timberlands are located in four states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Washington. Accordingly, if the level of production from these forests substantially declines, or if the demand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues.We are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel.We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Market interest rates may influence the price of our common shares.One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as compared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, 10Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statementswhich could adversely affect the price of our common shares.We have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt.As of December 31, 2011, we had $847 million of debt outstanding. See Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Contractual Financial Obligations for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided from operations and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if we enter into one or more strategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow. REIT and Tax-Related RisksIf we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholders because our REIT income will be subject to taxation.We intend to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""), and related U.S. Treasury regulations and administrative guidance. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not within our control. We cannot assure that we will remain qualified as a REIT or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income and we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income.In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer.If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay the additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.The extent of our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of performance fibers and wood products, non-passive real estate activities including dealer sale of HBU property and other real estate and the sale of logs. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level income tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use taxable REIT subsidiaries as extensively as we use them.Our status as a REIT may affect our ability to expand our taxable REIT subsidiaries' operations.Taxable REIT subsidiaries are limited in size based upon a REIT's real estate assets. Under the Code, no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be comprised of securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries' operations.Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of the value of its outstanding shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent or more of the value of our outstanding shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.11Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsWe may be limited in our ability to fund shareholder distributions using cash generated from our taxable REIT subsidiaries' operations.The ability of the REIT to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited by provisions of the Code. Specifically, at least 75 percent of a REIT's annual gross income must be derived from passive real estate rents, royalties and gains including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other passive non-real estate income. This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries may impact our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We can, however, under current law, issue stock dividends for up to 80 percent of our regular dividend distribution. Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from ""prohibited transactions."" In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of performance fibers and wood products which we produce and sales of logs constitute prohibited transactions. In addition, dealer sales of timberlands or other real estate constitute prohibited transactions.We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that become part of our ""dealer"" real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we face the potential of being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxable income, but not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. However, a REIT must pay corporate level tax on its undistributed capital gains. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate. "
7,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2011-02-23,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  Our operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all otherinformation in this Report. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Business and Operating Risks  The cyclical nature of our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations. Our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products and real estateindustries. The markets for timber, real estate, performance fibers and wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For example, the demand for real estate can be affected by changes in interest rates, availability andterms of financing, local economic conditions, the employment rate, new housing starts, population growth and demographics. The demand for sawtimber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercial construction activity, andcurrently sawtimber pricing continues to be below historic levels. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices. Both our Real Estate and Timberbusinesses have been negatively impacted by the current economic downturn, primarily due to the decline in housing starts, excess supply of existing housing inventory, unemployment and the tightening of credit availability for real estate andconstruction related projects.  The forest products and real estate industries are highly competitive. Some of our competitors in the forest products businesses have greater financial andoperating resources and own more timberlands than we do. Some of our forest products competitors may also be lower-cost producers in some of the businesses in which we operate. In addition, wood products are subject to significant competition from avariety of non-wood and engineered wood products. We are also subject to competition from various forest products, including logs and pulp products imported from foreign countries to the United States as well as to the export markets served by us.To the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressures from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business, and in particular product pricing, could be adversely affected. With respect to our Real Estatebusiness, one of our key strategies is to engage in activities that add long term value to our properties, including obtaining entitlements. Many of our competitors in this segment have greater experience in real estate entitlement than we do. Changes in energy and raw material prices could impact our operating results and financial condition. Energy and raw material costs, such as oil, natural gas, wood and chemicals, are asignificant operating expense, particularly for the Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses. The prices of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control,such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, caustic soda, a key raw material for Performance Fibers, has historically had significant pricevolatility. Oil and natural gas costs have also substantially increased in recent years and we have experienced, at times, limited availability of hardwood, primarily due to wet weather conditions which impact harvesting and result in increasedcosts for some Performance Fibers products. Increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in our Timber, Performance Fibers and Wood Productsbusinesses, the rising cost of fuel, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation for our products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third party logging and trucking services, could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes inglobal economic conditions, market trends and world events could impact customer demand. The global reach of our business, particularly the Performance Fibers business and our interest in the NewZealand JV, causes us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition to those experienced in the U.S. The current global economic and financial market situation is an example of such changes.Adverse changes in the following factors, among others, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations:      exposure to currencies other than the United States dollar;   6 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements   regulatory, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and,     trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification ofexemptions for taxes and tariffs, and import and export licensing requirements.  Ourbusinesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming morerestrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions, and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes mayadversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturing facilities, remediate contaminated properties and/or entitle real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlandsand endangered species, timber harvesting practices, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity andstringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Moreover, environmental policies of the current administration are in the aggregate more restrictive for industry andlandowners than those of the previous administration. For example, in 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pursued a number of initiatives which could, if implemented, impose additional operational and pollution controlobligations on industrial facilities like those of Rayonier, especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and stormwater control. In another example, the EPA recently issued regulations which significantly tighten emissions limits ofcertain air pollutants from industrial boilers. In addition, as a result of certain 2010 judicial rulings and EPA initiatives, such as the EPAs recently proposed numeric nutrient regulations affecting Floridas rivers and streams,silvicultural practices on our timberlands could be impacted in the future. Nonetheless, irrespective of any particular presidential administration, environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over timecould adversely affect our operating results.  If regulatory and environmental permits aredelayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. In connection with a variety of operations on our properties, we are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries inwhich we operate to perform certain activities. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Timber business, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning,insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested.These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizen groups. Appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant tothese permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In our Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, many modifications and capital projects at ourmanufacturing facilities require one or more environmental permits, or amendments to existing permits. Delays in obtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety ofoperations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands, and operate mills. Forexample, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices areapproved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. Also, interveners at times may bring legal action in Florida in opposition to entitlement and change of use of timberlands to commercial, industrialor residential use. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups andindividuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands,impact how we operate or limit our ability to invest in our mills. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands, or adversely affecting the timing,projected operating benefits or cost of capital projects at our mills.   7 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe impact of existing regulatory restrictions on futureharvesting activities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and mayprevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The sizeof the area subject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near ourtimberlands, including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, Red Hills salamander and flatwoods salamander in theSoutheast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act or similar state laws. Other species, such as the gopher tortoise, are currently under review for possible protection. As we gain additional information regarding the presence ofthreatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase. Our Performance Fibers and Wood Products mills are subject to stringent environmental lawsand regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits which contain conditions that govern how weoperate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant costs onour operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities inwhich we operate become more demanding.  We currently own or may acquire properties whichmay require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations, or may acquire timberlands and other properties,which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of soil, sediment and groundwater contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. For more detail, see Note 14  Liabilities for Dispositions and DiscontinuedOperations. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we currently have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediationof our properties, legal requirements relating to assessment and remediation of these properties continue to become more stringent and there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations, or that other unknownliabilities will not be discovered in the future.  Entitlement and development of real estate entails alengthy, uncertain and costly approval process.  Entitlement and development of realestate entails extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is common for a project to require multiple approvals, permits and consents from federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, inFlorida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the Growth Management Act) and local land use and development regulations. Inaddition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (DRI) application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, local landdevelopment regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands mayrequire one or more permits from the federal government. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost and timing of our real estate projects. The real estate entitlement process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and oftenextensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. A significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth anddevelopment, including zoning and future land use, public services, water availability, transportation and other infrastructure and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Growth ManagementAct and DRI process. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, by filing litigation to oppose particular entitlement activities and development projects, and in seeking legislation and other anti-growth limitations onreal estate development activities. We expect that this type of anti-growth activity may continue in the future.   8 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsIssues affecting real estate development also include theavailability of potable water for new development projects. For example, in Georgia, the Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act, which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the GeorgiaWater Council which was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estate development alongthe I-95 coastal corridor in southern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings. Concerns about the availability of potable water also exists in certain Florida counties, which could impact growth. Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the useand development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs and delays and liabilities that couldmaterially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.  Changes in demand forour real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.  A number of factors, including changes in demographics, tightening of credit, high unemployment and a slowing of commercial or residential real estate development, particularly along the I-95 coastalcorridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for our properties and negatively affect our results of operations. The current decline in the housing market in particular, together with the tightening of real state lending standards andavailability, certainly had such an effect in 2010 and is expected to continue into 2011.  Inaddition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factorsbeyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results. The impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, federal and state levels, remain uncertain atthis time.  Currently, there are numerous international, federal and state-levelinitiatives and proposals addressing domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases tofacilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more clean energy. In 2011, we believe the potential for climate change legislation at the federal level tobe unlikely.  In late 2009, the EPA issued an endangerment finding under the ClearAir Act (CAA) with respect to certain greenhouse gases, which could lead to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a criteria pollutant under the CAA and have significant ramifications for Rayonier and the industry in general. In thisregard, the EPA has published various proposed regulations, which are currently subject to numerous legal challenges, affecting the operation of existing and new industrial facilities that emit carbon dioxide. In addition, as a result of theEPAs decision to regulate greenhouse gases under the CAA, the states will now have to consider them in permitting new or modified facilities. On the international front, various efforts, including the United Nations-sponsored Cancun, Mexicoconference in December 2010, did not result in a binding agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.  Overall, it is likely that future legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way impact Rayonier, but it is unclear at this time whether such impact will be, in the aggregate, positiveor negative, or material. For example, while Rayoniers Performance Fibers mills produce greenhouses gases and utilize fossil fuels, they also generate a substantial amount of their energy from wood fiber (often referred to asbiomass), which may be viewed more favorably than fossil fuels in future legislative and regulatory proposals, but that is uncertain at this time. However, environmental groups have generally opposed the use of biomass for energyproduction due to their concerns about deforestation. Our extensive timber holdings and the biomass they produce may provide opportunities for us to benefit from new legislation and regulation, especially due to the potential benefits available fromcarbon capture and sequestration opportunities, sale of carbon credits and renewable portfolio standards that mandate the use of non-fossil fuels by electricity generators, which could lead to increased demand for biomassproducts from our forests. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier, from a cost, benefit and financial performance standpoint, remains uncertain at this time.   9 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsInvestment returns on pension assets may be lower than expected,requiring us to make significant additional cash contributions to our plans.  Wesponsor several defined benefit pension plans, which cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these plans. Because it is unknownwhat the investment return on pension assets will be in future years, no assurances can be given that future plan contributions required by applicable law will not be material. See Note 19  Employee Benefit Plans for additionalinformation about these plans, including funded status.  Our joint venture partners may have intereststhat differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.  We participate ina joint venture in New Zealand, and may enter into other joint venture projects; for example, as part of our real estate strategy. A joint venture involves potential risks such as:     not having voting control over the joint venture;      the venture partners at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours;     the venture partners may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to theinvestment; and,      the venture partners could experience financial difficulties. Actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greaterthan those contemplated by the joint venture agreement or to other adverse consequences.  We may beunsuccessful in carrying out our land acquisition strategy.  We have pursued, andintend to continue to pursue, acquisitions of timberland and real estate properties that meet our investment criteria. Our timberland and real estate acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. We anticipate financing any suchacquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, the use of equity, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. The failure to identify and completesuitable timberland and real estate property acquisitions, and the failure of any acquisitions to perform to our expectations, could adversely affect our operating results. Our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Approximately 50 percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are exclusivelyin our Performance Fibers business. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with these employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict theefficiency of our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. If the unionized employees were toengage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financialcondition.  Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales. Weather conditions, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access may limitharvesting of our timberlands, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes. We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire. The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire, insectinfestation, severe weather, disease, natural disasters and other causes beyond our control. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not maintaininsurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to these causes.   10 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsA significant portion of the timberland that we own, lease or manageis concentrated in limited geographic areas.  We own, lease or manage approximately2.4 million acres of timberland and real estate located primarily in the United States and New Zealand. Over 75 percent of our timberlands are located in four states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Washington. Accordingly, if the level ofproduction from these forests substantially declines, or if the demand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues. We are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel. We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain keysenior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Market interest rates may influence the price of our common shares. One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield ascompared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common shares. We have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt. As of December 31, 2010, we had $768 million of debt outstanding. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual Financial Obligations for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cashequivalents, marketable securities, cash provided from operations and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if weenter into one or more strategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renewcredit lines prior to their expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flow.  REIT andTax-Related Risks  If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available fordistribution to our shareholders because our REIT income will be subject to taxation. We intend to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,as amended (the Code). For example, as a REIT, we generally will not pay corporate-level tax on income we distribute to our shareholders (other than the income of TRS) as long as we distribute at least 90 percent of our REIT taxableincome (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction) and 95 percent of our net capital gains. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhapsretroactively, and which are not within our control. We cannot assure that we will remain qualified as a REIT or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect ourability to remain qualified as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.  If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will suffer the following negative results:      we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our REIT taxable income; and,     we will be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income. In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following theyear during which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years orlonger.  If we fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidatesome investments or assets to pay the additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.   11 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsThe extent of our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may affect theprice of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.  We conduct asignificant portion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of performance fibersand wood products, real estate entitlement activities and sale of HBU property and other real estate (as a dealer), and sale of logs. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the incomegenerated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Under the Code, no more than 25 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be comprised of securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. This limitation may affect our ability toincrease the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries operations. Furthermore, our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use taxable REITsubsidiaries as extensively as we use them.  Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions inour articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  In order toqualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of the value of its outstanding shares during the last six months in each calendaryear. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with thatrule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percentor more of the value of our outstanding shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. We may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The ability of the REIT to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries islimited by provisions of the Code. Specifically, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estateincome and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other non-real estate income. This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries may impact ourability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We can, however, under current law, issue stock dividends for up to 90 percent of our regular dividend distribution through 2011. The netincome of our taxable REIT subsidiaries is not required to be distributed, and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax. As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from prohibitedtransactions. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of performance fibers and wood products which we produce and sales of logs constituteprohibited transactions. In addition, dealer sales of timberlands or other real estate constitute prohibited transactions.  We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however,always be able to identify timberland properties that will become part of our dealer real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinarycourse of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we face the potential of being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.   12 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial StatementsOur cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate. Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their ordinary taxableincome, but not their net capital gains income. However, a REIT must pay corporate level tax on its undistributed capital gains. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all ofour taxable income is treated as capital gains income. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factorsinclude, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cashpayments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands, including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, ourdividend levels may fluctuate.  Alternative fuel mixture and cellulosic biofuel producer credit(s). The Company has disclosed information concerning its eligibility for the alternativefuel mixture and cellulosic biofuel producer tax credits. See Note 3  Alternative Fuel Mixture Credit (AFMC) and Cellulosic Biofuel Producer Credit (CBPC) for additional information. Under applicablelaw, which expired on December 31, 2009, the tax credits were earned through the burning of qualifying fuels on or before such date. There can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not challenge theCompanys eligibility for, and amount of, such tax credits.   "
8,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2010-02-24,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  Certain statements in this document regarding anticipated financial outcomes including earnings guidance, if any, business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Rayoniers future financial andoperational performance, are forward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements areidentified by the use of words such as may, will, should, expect, estimate, believe, anticipate and other similar language. Forward-looking statements are notguarantees of future performance and undue reliance should not be placed on these statements. The following risk factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements that are madein this document.  Forward-looking statements are only as of the date they are made, and the Companyundertakes no duty to update its forward- looking statements except as required by law. You are advised, however, to review any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our subsequent Forms 10-Q, 10-K, 8-K and other reports to the SEC. Our operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investmentin our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this Report. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operatingresults, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.  Business and Operating Risks The cyclical nature of our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products and realestate industries. The markets for timber, real estate, performance fibers and wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For example, the demand for real estate can be affected by changes in interest rates,availability and terms of financing, local economic conditions, new housing starts, population growth and demographics. The demand for sawtimber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercial construction activity, andcurrently sawtimber pricing is below historic levels. Both our Real Estate and Timber businesses have been negatively impacted by the current economic downturn, primarily due to the decline in housing starts and the tightening of credit availabilityfor real estate and construction related projects. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices.  The forest products and real estate industries are highly competitive.  Some of our competitors in the forest products businesses have greater financial and operating resources andown more timberlands than we do. Some of our forest products competitors may also be lower-cost producers in some of the businesses in which we operate. In addition, wood products are subject to significant competition from a variety of non-wood andengineered wood products. We are also subject to competition from various forest products, including logs and pulp products imported from foreign countries to the United States as well as to the export markets served by us. To the extent there is asignificant increase in competitive pressures from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. With respect to our real estate business, one of our key strategies is to engage in activitiesthat add long term value to our properties, including obtaining entitlements. Many of our competitors in this segment have greater experience in real estate entitlement than we do.  Changes in energy and raw material prices could impact our operating results and financial condition. Energy and raw material costs, such as oil, natural gas, wood, and chemicals are asignificant operating expense, particularly for the Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses. The prices of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control suchas changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, in 2008, we experienced significant volatility in energy, chemicals, transportation and other input costs,although in 2009 pricing for some of these inputs has returned to relatively normal levels. Oil and natural gas costs have also substantially increased in recent years and we have experienced, at times, a limited availability of hardwood, primarilydue to wet weather conditions which impacts harvesting and results in increased costs for some Performance Fibers products. Increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition  6 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  and results of operations. In addition, in our Timber, Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, the rising cost of fuel, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation forour products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third party logging and trucking services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in global economic conditions, market trends and world events could impact customer demand. The global reach of our business, particularly the Performance Fibers business and ourinterest in the New Zealand joint venture, causes us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition to those experienced in the U.S. The current global economic and financial market situation isan example of such changes. Adverse changes in the following factors, among others, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations:      exposure to currencies other than the United States dollar;      regulatory, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and,      trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification ofexemptions for taxes and tariffs, and import and export licensing requirements.  Ourbusinesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.  Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions, and administrativeinterpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturingfacilities, remediate contaminated properties and/or develop real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands, endangered species, timber harvesting practices, recreation and aesthetics,protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and theenforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Moreover, environmental policies of the current administration are in the aggregate, more restrictive for industry and landowners than those of the previous administration. For example, in2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed a number of initiatives which could, if implemented, impose additional operational and pollution control obligations on industrial facilities like those of Rayonier,especially in the area of air emissions and wastewater and stormwater control. Nonetheless, irrespective of any particular presidential administration, environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over timecould adversely affect our operating results.  If regulatory and environmental permits aredelayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. In connection with a variety of operations on our properties, we are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries inwhich we operate to perform certain activities. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Timber business, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning,insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested.These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizen groups. Appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant tothese permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In our Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, many modifications and capital projects at ourmanufacturing facilities require an environmental permit, or an amendment to an existing permit. Delays in obtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations.We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands, and operate mills. For example, as describedin more detail in Item 3  Legal Proceedings, the Altamaha Riverkeeper, a non-profit environmental group, has alleged noncompliance by our Jesup mill with certain laws relating to its effluent discharge, and has threatened to file acitizen suit against  7 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  Rayonier pursuant to the provisions of the Clean Water Act if the groups concerns are not addressed to their satisfaction. In Washington State, environmental groups and interestedindividuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or preventoperations on our properties. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups andindividuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits, implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands,impact how we operate or our ability to invest in our mills. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands, or adversely affecting the projected operatingbenefits or cost of capital projects at our mills.  The impact of existing regulatoryrestrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways andwetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degradeits habitat. The size of the area subject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally liveon or near our timberlands, including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, red hill salamander, and flatwoodssalamander in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act or similar state laws. Other species, such as the gopher tortoise, are currently under review for possible protection. As we gain additional information regardingthe presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions couldincrease.  Our Performance Fibers and Wood Products mills are subject to stringentenvironmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws, regulations and permits which contain conditionsthat govern how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and imposesignificant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. For example, the U.S. EPA has recently proposed regulations governing the emission of certain air pollutants from industrial boilers, and the discharge of certainpollutants into Floridas waterways. It is expected that, overall, these costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which weoperate become more demanding.  We currently own or may acquire properties which mayrequire environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations, or may acquire timberlands and other properties,which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as remediation of hazardous material contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. For more detail, see Note 16  Liabilities for Dispositions and Discontinued Operations.The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we currently have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediation of ourproperties, there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations, or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future.  Entitlement and development of real estate entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process.  Entitlement and development of real estate entails extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatoryjurisdictions. It is common for a project to require multiple approvals, permits and consents from federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions ofthe Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the Growth Management Act) and local land use and development regulations. In addition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specifiedregulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (DRI) application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, local land development regulations and the DRI process is  8 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands mayrequire one or more permits from the federal government. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost and timing of our real estate projects.  The real estate entitlement process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessaryapprovals and permits. A significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, wateravailability, infrastructure and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Growth Management Act and DRI process. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, inseeking constitutional amendments, legislation and other anti-growth limitations on real estate development activities. For example, it is expected that a proposed constitutional amendment, called Amendment 4, will appear on the Floridaballot in November 2010, which, if enacted, will impose significant limitations on the ability of Florida municipalities to change the approved uses of property. We expect that this type of anti-growth activity may continue in the future. Issues affecting real estate development also include the availability of potable water fornew development projects. For example, in Georgia, the Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act, which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which was chargedwith preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the I-95 coastal corridor insouthern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings.  Changes in theinterpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding ourproperties could lead to new or greater costs and delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.  Changes in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.  A number of factors, including changes in demographics, tightening of credit, and a slowing of commercial orresidential real estate development, particularly along the I-95 coastal corridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for our properties and negatively affect our results of operations. The current decline in the economy generally and inthe housing market in particular, together with the deterioration of the credit markets, has certainly had such an effect in 2009 and is expected to continue into 2010.  In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adverselyaffect our operating results. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factors beyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operatingresults.  The impacts of climate-related initiatives, at the international, federal and state levels,remain uncertain at this time.  Currently, there are numerous international, federaland state-level initiatives and proposals addressing domestic and global climate issues. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide and other greenhousegases to facilitate the reduction of carbon compound emissions to the atmosphere, and provide tax and other incentives to produce and use more clean energy. For example, in 2009 the U.S. House of Representatives passed theMarkey-Waxman bill (HR 2454), which would establish a so-called cap and trade regime and new permitting requirements to regulate greenhouse gas generation, as well as provide an incentive for the production and use of clean energy. Todate, the U.S. Senate has not passed any comparable legislation. In sum, we believe that the potential for climate change legislation on the federal level is unknown. In addition, in late 2009, the U.S. EPA issued an endangerment findingunder the Clear Air Act (CAA) with respect to carbon dioxide, which could lead to the regulation of carbon dioxide as a criteria pollutant under the CAA and have significant ramifications for Rayonier and the industry in general. On theinternational front, the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen, which took place in December 2009, did not result in any significant progress toward a binding agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012.  9 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  Overall, it is likely that future legislative and regulatory activity in this area will in some way impact Rayonier, but it is unclear at this time whether such impact will be, in the aggregate, positiveor negative, or material. For example, while Rayoniers Performance Fibers mills produce greenhouses gases and utilize fossil fuels, they also generate a substantial amount of their energy from wood fiber (often referred to asbiomass), which is generally favored under most current legislative and regulatory proposals. In addition, our extensive timber holdings and the biomass they produce may provide opportunities for us to benefit from new legislation andregulation, especially due to the potential benefits available from carbon capture and sequestration opportunities, sale of carbon credits and renewable portfolio standards that mandate the use of non-fossil fuels byelectricity generators, which could lead to increased demand for biomass products from our forests. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier, from a cost, benefit and financialperformance standpoint, is uncertain at this time.  The precipitous decline in the stock market in 2008impacted our pension plan investment performance and despite partial recovery in 2009, absent additional federal legislation, may require us to make significant additional cash contributions to our plans.  We sponsor several defined benefit pension plans, which cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. Dueto the precipitous decline in the stock market (the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) declined approximately 32 percent in 2008), the value of our pension plan equity assets has also dropped significantly. In 2009, the value of ourplans assets increased as the stock market recovered (the DJIA increased approximately 19 percent in 2009). The Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 (PPA) requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of theseplans. Recognizing that this issue affects much of corporate America, in December 2008 federal legislation was passed (as part of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008) which provides short term relief to plan sponsors by allowingthem to phase in the funding requirements of the PPA over three years, among other things. Because it is unknown how the stock market will perform over the next 12 to 24 months and whether additional legislation will be passed to address this issue,no assurances can be given that any additional plan contributions required by applicable law will not be material.  Our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.  We participate in a joint venture in New Zealand, and may enter into other joint venture projects; for example, as part of our real estate strategy. A joint venture involves potential risks such as:     not having voting control over the joint venture;      the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours;      the venture partner may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to theinvestment; and,      the venture partner could experience financial difficulties.  Actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater thanthose contemplated by the joint venture agreement or to other adverse consequences.  We may beunsuccessful in carrying out our land acquisition strategy.  We have pursued, andintend to continue to pursue, acquisitions of strategic timberland and real estate properties that meet our investment criteria. Our timberland and real estate acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. We anticipate financingany such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. The failure to identify and complete suitabletimberland and real estate property acquisitions, and the failure of any acquisitions to perform to our expectations, could adversely affect our operating results.  Our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Approximately 50 percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are exclusively in our PerformanceFibers business. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with these employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of ouroperations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. For example, in 2010 we will engage in collective  10 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  bargaining agreement negotiations with unions representing substantially all of the hourly employees at our Fernandina Beach Performance Fibers mill. The mills current collective bargainingagreements expire in April 2010. If the unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a materialadverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Weather and othernatural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.  Weather conditions, timbergrowth cycles and restrictions on access may limit harvesting of our timberlands, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes.  We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire.  The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire, insectinfestation, severe weather, disease, natural disasters, and other causes beyond our control. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the forestry industry, we do not maintaininsurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to these causes.  A significant portion ofthe timberland that we own, lease or manage is concentrated in limited geographic areas.  We own, lease or manage approximately 2.5 million acres of timberland and real estate located primarily in the United States and New Zealand. Over 75 percent of our timberlands are located in four states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia andWashington. Accordingly, if the level of production from these forests substantially declines, or if the demand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues. We are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel.  We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain keysenior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Market interest rates may influence the price of our common shares.  One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as comparedto yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common shares.  We have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt.  As of December 31, 2009, we had $700 million of debt outstanding. See Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual Financial Obligations for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cashequivalents, marketable securities, cash provided from operations, and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if weenter into one or more strategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renewcredit lines prior to their expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.   11 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  REIT and Tax-Related Risks If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced fundsavailable for distribution to our shareholders because our timber-related income will be subject to taxation.  We intend to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). For example, as a REIT, we generally will not paycorporate-level tax on income we distribute to our shareholders (other than the income of TRS) as long as we distribute at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding netcapital gains). Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not within our control. We cannot assure that we will qualifyas a REIT or be able to remain so qualified or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequencesof such qualification.  If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will sufferthe following negative results:      we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income; and,      we will be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income.  In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the yearduring which the qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments orassets to pay the additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.  The extent of our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.  We conduct a significant portion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries.Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of performance fibers and wood products, real estate entitlement activities and sale of HBU property and other realestate (as a dealer) and sale of logs. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Under the Code, no more than 25 percent of the value of thegross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries operations. Furthermore, our use of taxable REITsubsidiaries may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use taxable REIT subsidiaries as extensively as we use them.  Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability toqualify as a REIT.  In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewerindividuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of the value of its outstanding shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REITprovisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownershiprules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent or more of the value of our outstanding shares,which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.  We may be limited in our ability to funddistributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.  The abilityof the REIT to receive dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derivedfrom passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other non-realestate income.   12 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries may impact our ability to fund cash distributions to our shareholders using cash flows from our taxable REITsubsidiaries. We can, however, under current law, issue stock dividends for up to 90 percent of our regular dividend distribution for calendar years 2009 through 2011. The net income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries is not required to bedistributed, and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement.  Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.  As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from prohibited transactions. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customersin the ordinary course of business. Sales of performance fibers and wood products which we produce and sales of logs constitute prohibited transactions. In addition, sales of timberlands or other real estate (as a dealer) constitute prohibitedtransactions.  We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conductingactivities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that will become part of our dealer real estate salesbusiness. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course ofbusiness, we face the potential of being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.  Our cash dividends arenot guaranteed and may fluctuate.  Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90percent of their ordinary taxable income, but not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gainsincome. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our shareholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These factors include, but are not limited to, our results ofoperations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures,harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.  We may not be able to complete desired like-kind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell. When we sell timberlands and real estate, we generally seek to match these sales withthe acquisition of suitable replacement timberlands. This allows us like-kind exchange treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the Code. This matching of sales and purchases provides us withsignificant tax benefits, most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property. While we attempt to complete like-kind exchanges wherever practical, we will not be able to do so in allinstances due to various factors, including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms, our inability to complete a qualifying like-kind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the Code and if weincorrectly identify real estate as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The inability to obtain like-kind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold, and acorresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends.  Alternative fuel mixture credit.  The Company has disclosed informationconcerning its eligibility for the alternative fuel mixture credit. See Note 3  Alternative Fuel Mixture Credit (AFMC) for additional information. Under applicable law, which expired on December 31, 2009, the taxcredit was earned through the burning of qualifying fuel mixtures on or before such date. There can be no assurance that the IRS will not challenge the Companys eligibility for, and amount of, such tax credit.   "
2,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2009-02-27,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  Certain statements inthis document regarding anticipated financial outcomes including earnings guidance, if any, business and market conditions, outlook and other similar statements relating to Rayoniers future financial and operational performance, areforward-looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and other federal securities laws. These forward-looking statements are identified by the use of words such asmay, will, should, expect, estimate, believe, anticipate and other similar language. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and unduereliance should not be placed on these statements. The following risk factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward looking statements that are made in this document.  Our operations are subject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, youshould carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this report. If any of the events described in the following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as themarket price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected. Rayonier assumes no obligation to update these statements except as is required by law.  Business and Operating Risks  The current global economic downturn and turmoil in the global creditmarkets could limit demand for our products and real estate, and affect the overall availability and cost of credit for Rayonier and its customers and suppliers.  The global economic downturn and unprecedented deterioration of the global credit markets has adversely affected, andcould further adversely affect, various aspects of our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. At this time, it is impossible to predict the outcome of various actions taken by the U.S. government, including the passage of theEmergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, and whether these and other measures currently being implemented or contemplated by the government will mitigate the effects of the crisis. Withrespect to Rayonier, while we have no immediate need to access the credit markets, the impact of the current crisis on our ability to obtain financing in the future, and the cost and terms of that financing, is unclear. Similarly, the inability ofour customers and suppliers to obtain financing could adversely affect our business if their ability to operate or fund transactions (such as real estate purchases) is impacted. We have already seen a small number of our customers file forbankruptcy protection due to economic conditions or the inability to refinance debt, although the effects of these bankruptcies to Rayonier have not been significant to date. No assurances can be given that the effects of the current economicdownturn and deterioration of the credit markets will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  The precipitous decline in the stock market has impacted our pension plan investment performance and, absent a significant recovery in the market or additional federal legislation, may require us to makesignificant additional cash contributions to our plans.  We sponsor several defined benefit pensionplans, which cover many of our salaried and hourly employees. Due to the precipitous decline in the stock market (the Dow Jones Industrial Average declined approximately 32 percent in 2008), the value of our pension plan equity assets has alsodropped significantly. However, the Federal Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the PPA) requires that certain capitalization levels be maintained in each of these plans. Recognizing that this issue affects much of Corporate America, in December 2008federal legislation was passed (as part of the Worker, Retiree, and Employer Recovery Act of 2008) which provides short term relief to plan sponsors by allowing them to phase in the funding requirements of the PPA over three years, among otherthings. Because it is unknown how the stock market will perform over the next 12 to 24 months and whether additional legislation will be passed to address this issue, no assurances can be given that any additional plan contributions required byapplicable law will not be material.  The cyclical nature of our businesses could adversely affect our results ofoperations.  Our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products andreal estate industries. The markets for timber, real estate, performance fibers and wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For example, the demand for real estate can be affected by changes in interest rates,availability and terms of financing, local economic conditions, new housing starts, population growth and demographics. The demand for sawtimber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercial construction activity. Both ourReal Estate and Timber   6 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  businesses have been negatively impacted by the current economic downturn, primarily due to the decline in housing starts and the deterioration of the creditmarkets. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices.  The forest products and real estate industries are highly competitive.  Some of our competitors in the forest products businesses have greater financial and operating resources and own more timberlands than we do. Some of our forest products competitors may also be lower-cost producers in some of the businessesin which we operate. In addition, wood products are subject to significant competition from a variety of non-wood and engineered wood products. We are also subject to competition from various forest products, including logs, imported from foreigncountries to the United States as well as to the export markets served by us. To the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressures from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be adverselyaffected. With respect to our real estate business, one of our key strategies is to engage in activities that add long term value to our properties, including obtaining entitlements and entering into joint venture type arrangements. Many of ourcompetitors in this segment have greater experience in real estate entitlement and development than we do.  Changesin energy and raw materials prices could impact our operating results and financial condition.  Energy and raw material costs, such as oil, natural gas, wood, and chemicals are a significant operating expense, particularly for the Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses. The prices of raw materials and energy can be volatileand are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, in 2008, weexperienced significant volatility in energy, chemicals, transportation and other input costs. Oil and natural gas costs have also increased substantially in recent years and we have experienced, at times, a limited availability of hardwood whichhas resulted in increased production costs for some Performance Fibers products. Increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, in our Timber,Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, the rising cost of fuel, and its impact on the cost and availability of transportation for our products, both domestically and internationally, and the cost and availability of third party logging andtrucking services, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in global economic conditions, market trends and world events could impact customer demand.  The global reach of our business, particularly the Performance Fibers business and our interest in the New Zealand joint venture, causes us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events andcircumstances in addition to those experienced in the U.S. The current global economic and financial market crises are examples of such changes. Adverse changes in the following factors, among others, could have a negative impact on our business andresults of operations:      exposure to currencies other than the United States dollar;      regulatory, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and,      trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions fortaxes and tariffs, and import and export licensing requirements.  The impacts of climateinitiatives, at the international, federal and state levels, are uncertain at this time.  Currently,there are numerous international, federal and state-level initiatives and proposals addressing global climate issues. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbon dioxide andother so-called greenhouse gases. Moreover, the results of the recent federal election will likely result in a shift to a more aggressive approach on the federal level in addressing climate change issues. It is likely that futurelegislative and regulatory activity in this area will impact Rayonier, but it is unclear at this time whether such impact will be, in the aggregate, positive or negative. For example, while Rayoniers Performance Fibers mills producegreenhouses gases and utilize fossil fuels, they also generate a substantial amount of their energy from wood fiber (often referred to as biomass), which is favored under most current legislative proposals. In addition, our extensivetimber holdings and the biomass they produce may provide opportunities for us to benefit from new legislation and regulation, especially in states that have implemented renewable portfolio standards that mandate the use of non-fossilfuels by electricity generators. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier is uncertain at this time.   7 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  Ourbusinesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.  If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could be adversely affected. In connection with a variety of operations on ourproperties, we are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Timberbusiness, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in WashingtonState, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizen groups.Appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results.In our Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, many modifications and capital projects at our manufacturing facilities require an environmental permit, or an amendment to an existing permit. Delays in obtaining these permits could have anadverse effect on our results of operations.  Environmental groups and interested individuals may seekto delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or managetimberlands, and operate mills. For example, as described in more detail in Note 16  Contingencies, the Altamaha Riverkeeper, a non-profit environmental group, has alleged noncompliance by our Jesup mill with certain laws relating toits effluent discharge, and has threatened to file a citizen suit against Rayonier pursuant to the provisions of the Clean Water Act if the groups concerns are not addressed to their satisfaction. In Washington State, environmentalgroups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges couldmaterially delay or prevent operations on our properties. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatoryproceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits or implementing capital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit coulddelay harvesting on our timberlands, or impact how we operate or our ability to invest in our mills. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands, oradversely affecting the projected operating benefits or cost of capital projects at our mills.  Theimpact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species,as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected speciesor significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the area subject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number ofspecies that naturally live on or near our timberlands, including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, red hillsalamander, and flatwoods salamander in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act or similar state laws. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, orif other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.  Our manufacturing operations, and in particular our Performance Fibers and Wood Products mills, are subject tostringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal. Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations and permits whichcontain conditions that govern how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increaseproduction, and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, these costs will likely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become morestringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.  Wecurrently own or may acquire properties which may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations, ormay acquire timberlands and other properties, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as   8 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  remediation of hazardous material contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminatedproperties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediation of our current properties, there can be no assurance that actual expenditures willnot exceed our expectations, or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered in the future.  Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to changeand new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturing facilities, remediate contaminated properties and/or develop realestate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands, endangered species, timber harvesting practices, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality,and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. Moreover, we believethat environmental policies of the current administration are likely to be, in the aggregate, more restrictive for industry and landowners than those of the previous administration. Nonetheless, irrespective of any particular presidentialadministration, environmental laws and regulations will likely continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results.  Entitlement and development of real estate entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process.  Entitlement and development of real estate entails extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatoryjurisdictions. It is common for a project to require various approvals, permits and consents from federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions ofthe Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the Growth Management Act) and local land use and development regulations. In addition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specifiedregulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (DRI) application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, local land development regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly andsignificant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands may require one or more permits from the federal government. Any of these issues canmaterially affect the cost and timing of our real estate projects.  The real estate entitlement process isfrequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. A significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which localgovernments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, infrastructure and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the GrowthManagement Act and DRI process. In addition, anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, in seeking constitutional amendments, legislation and other anti-growth limitations on real estate development activities. We expect this type ofactivity to continue in the future.  Issues affecting real estate development also include the availabilityof potable water for new development projects. For example, in Georgia, the Legislature enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act (the Watershed Management Act), which, among other things, created agovernmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost andtiming of real estate development along the I-95 coastal corridor in southern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings.  Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and localgovernmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs, delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.  Changes in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operatingresults.  A number of factors, including changes in demographics, tightening of credit, and aslowing of commercial or residential real estate development, particularly along the I-95 coastal corridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for our properties and negatively affect our results of operations. The current decline in theeconomy generally and in the housing market in particular, together with the deterioration of the credit markets, has certainly had such an effect in 2008 and is expected to continue into 2009.   9 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operating results. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be causedby factors beyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results.  Our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.  We participate in a joint venture in New Zealand, and may enter into other joint venture projects: for example, as part of our real estate strategy. A joint venture involves potential risks such as:      not having voting control over the joint venture;      the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours;      the venture partner may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the investment; and,     the venture partner could experience financial difficulties.  Actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than thosecontemplated by the joint venture agreement or to other adverse consequences.  We may be unsuccessful in carrying outour acquisition strategy.  We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, acquisitions ofstrategic timberland and real estate properties that meet our investment criteria. Our timberland and real estate acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. We anticipate financing any such acquisitions through cash fromoperations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. The failure to identify and complete suitable timberland and real estate properties, and thefailure of any acquisitions to perform to our expectations, could adversely affect our operating results.  Ourfailure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Approximately 48 percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are exclusively in our Performance Fibers business. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with these employees collectively. Ourfinancial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could resultin strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. For example, we are currently engaged in collective bargaining agreement negotiations with unions representing substantially all of the hourly employees at our Jesup mill. If the unionizedemployees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results ofoperations and financial condition.  Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales. Weather conditions, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access may limit harvesting of ourtimberlands, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes.  We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire.  The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire, insect infestation, severe weather, disease, natural disasters, and other causes beyond ourcontrol. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the industry, we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to these causes.  A significant portion of the timberland that we own, lease or manage is concentrated in limited geographic areas. We own, lease or manage approximately 2.6 million acres of timberland and real estate locatedprimarily in the United States and New Zealand. Over 75 percent of our timberlands are located in four states: Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Washington. Accordingly, if the level of production from these forests substantially declines, or if thedemand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues.   10 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  We aredependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel.  We believe that our success depends, to asignificant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Market interest rates may influence the price of our common shares.  One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as compared to yields onother financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common shares.  We have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt.  As of December 31, 2008, we had $771 million of debt outstanding. See Item 7  ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual Financial Obligations for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketablesecurities, cash provided from operations, and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if we enter into one or morestrategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renew credit lines prior totheir expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.  REIT and Tax-Related Risks If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available for distribution toour shareholders because our timber-related income will be subject to taxation.  We intend tooperate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). For example, as a REIT, we generally will not pay corporate-level tax on income we distribute to our shareholders (otherthan the income of TRS) as long as we distribute at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains). Qualification as a REIT involves the application ofhighly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not entirely within our control. We cannot assure that we will qualify as a REIT or be able to remain so qualified or that newlegislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.  If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will suffer the following negative results:      we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income; and,      we will be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income.  In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during whichthe qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay theadditional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.  Theextent of our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.  We conduct a portion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activitiessuch as the production and sale of performance fibers and wood products, real estate sales of HBU property and timberlands (as a dealer) and sales of logs. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level tax. Therefore, we pay income taxeson the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Under the Code, no more than 20 percent (25 percent beginning in calendar year 2009) of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REITsubsidiaries. This   11 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries operations. Furthermore, our use of taxable REIT subsidiariesmay cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use taxable REIT subsidiaries as extensively as we use them.  Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly afterapplying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of its outstanding voting shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adoptedownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plansto adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent or more of our outstanding voting shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. We may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The ability for the REIT to receive dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited by therules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and othertypes of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other non-qualifying income.  This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries may impact our ability to fundcash distributions to stockholders using cash flows from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. We can, however, under current law, issue stock dividends for up to 90 percent of our regular dividend distribution for 2009. The net income of our taxable REITsubsidiaries is not required to be distributed, and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the REIT income distribution requirement.  Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.  As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from prohibited transactions. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in theordinary course of business. Sales of performance fibers and wood products which we produce and sales of logs constitute prohibited transactions. In addition, sales of timberlands or other real estate (as a dealer) and certain development activitiesrelating to real estate could, in certain circumstances, constitute prohibited transactions.  We intend toavoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that willbecome part of our dealer real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become propertiesheld for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we face the potential of being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.  We may have adjustments to deferred and contingent tax liabilities.  The IRS may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the time we qualified as a REIT, in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties, if any. Moreover, any increase in taxableincome for those years will result in an increase in accumulated earnings and profits, or E&P, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our then-existing shareholders within 90 days of the relevant determination. Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.  Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their taxable income. However, REITs are required to distributeonly their ordinary taxable income and not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income.Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our   12 Table of ContentsIndex to Financial Statements  stockholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capitalrequirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in theprice and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.  We may not be able to complete desired like-kind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell. When we sell timberlands and real estate, we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitablereplacement real estate. This allows us like-kind exchange treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the Code. This matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits, mostimportantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property. While we attempt to complete like-kind exchanges wherever practical, we will not be able to do so in all instances due to variousfactors, including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms, our inability to complete a qualifying like-kind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the Code and if we incorrectly identify realestate as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently becomes real estate held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The inability to obtain like-kind exchange treatment wouldresult in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold, and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends.   "
3,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2008-02-28,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  Our operations aresubject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this report. If any of the events described inthe following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.  Business and Operating Risks  The cyclicalnature of our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our financialperformance is affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products and real estate industries. The markets for timber, real estate, performance fibers and wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For example, thedemand for real estate can be affected by changes in interest rates, local economic conditions, new housing starts, population growth and demographics. The demand for sawtimber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercialconstruction activity. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices.   7 Table of Contents  The forest productsand real estate industries are highly competitive.  Many of our competitors in the forest productsbusinesses have substantially greater financial and operating resources and own more timberlands than we do. Some of our forest products competitors may also be lower-cost producers in some of the businesses in which we operate. In addition, woodproducts are subject to significant competition from a variety of non-wood and engineered wood products. We are also subject to competition from various forest products, including logs, imported from foreign countries to the United States as well asto the export markets served by us. To the extent there is a significant increase in competitive pressures from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. With respect to our real estatebusiness, we are continuing the transition from a bulk land seller to engaging in value-added real estate development activities, including obtaining entitlements and entering into joint venture, participation and other development-relatedarrangements. Many of our competitors in this segment have greater experience in real estate entitlement and development than we do.  Changes in energy and raw materials prices could impact our operating results and financial condition.  Energy and raw material costs, such as oil, natural gas, wood, and chemicals are a significant operating expense, particularly for the Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses. The prices of raw materials andenergy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions, political unrest, instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations.For example, oil and natural gas costs have increased substantially in recent years and we have experienced, at times, a limited availability of hardwood which has resulted in increased production costs for some Performance Fibers products.Increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in global economic conditions, market trends and world events could impact customer demand.  The global reach of our business, particularly the Performance Fibers business and our interest in the New Zealand JV, causes us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events andcircumstances in addition to those experienced in the U.S. Adverse changes in the following factors, among others, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations:      effects of exposure to currencies other than the United States dollar;      regulatory, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and,      trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions fortaxes and tariffs, and import and export licensing requirements.  The impacts of climate initiatives, at theinternational, federal and state levels, are uncertain at this time.  Currently, there are numerousinternational, federal and state-level initiatives and proposals relating to addressing the effects of global climate change. Within the U.S., most of these proposals would regulate and/or tax, in one fashion or another, the production of carbondioxide and other so-called greenhouse gases. It is likely that future legislative and regulatory activity in this area will impact Rayonier, but it is unclear at this time whether such impact will be, in the aggregate, positive ornegative. For example, while Rayoniers Performance Fibers mills produce greenhouses gases and utilize fossil fuels, our extensive timber holdings and the biomass they produce may provide opportunities for us to benefit from new legislation andregulation. We continue to monitor political and regulatory developments in this area, but their overall impact on Rayonier is uncertain at this time.  Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.  If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of our operations could beadversely affected. In connection with a variety of operations on our properties, we are required to seek permission from government agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities. Any of these agenciescould delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Timber business, any delay associated with a filing could result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have anadverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a Forest Practice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by theregulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizen groups. Appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or   8 Table of Contents  restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverseeffect on our operating results. In our Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses, many modifications and capital projects at our manufacturing facilities require an environmental permit, or an amendment to an existing permit. Delays inobtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Environmental groupsand interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countrieswhere we own, lease or manage timberlands, and operate mills. For example, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board tochallenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interestedindividuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits or implementingcapital improvements or pursuing operating plans. Any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands or impact our ability to invest in our mills. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgmentpreventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands, or adversely affecting the projected operating benefits or cost of capital projects at our mills.  The impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be significant. Federal, stateand local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities onour timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the area subject to restriction will vary depending on theprotected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near our timberlands, including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet,bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, red hill salamander, and flatwoods salamander in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act orsimilar state laws. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if other regulations, such as those that require buffers to protect water bodies, become more restrictive, theamount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.  Our manufacturing operations,and in particular our Performance Fibers and Wood Products mills, are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal. Many of our operations aresubject to stringent environmental laws and regulations and permits which contain conditions that govern how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future,may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, these costs will likely increase over time asenvironmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.  We currently own or may acquire properties which may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject toenvironmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations, or may acquire timberlands and other properties, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such asremediation of hazardous material contamination and other existing or potential liabilities. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although webelieve we have adequate liabilities for the investigation and remediation of our current properties, there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations, or that other unknown liabilities will not be discovered inthe future.  Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming morerestrictive. Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes mayadversely affect our ability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturing facilities and/or develop real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands, endangered species, timberharvesting practices, recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and  9 Table of Contents  regulations have increased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. We believe that these laws and regulations willcontinue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results.  Entitlement anddevelopment of real estate entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process.  Entitlementand development of real estate entails extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is common for a project to require various approvals, permits and consents from federal, state and local governing and regulatorybodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the Growth Management Act) and local land use anddevelopment regulations. In addition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (DRI) application. Compliance with the Growth ManagementAct, local land development regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineatedwetlands may require one or more permits from the federal government. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost and timing of our real estate development activities.  The real estate entitlement and development process is frequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and oftenextensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. A significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which local governments face challenging issues relating to growth anddevelopment, including zoning and future land use, public services, infrastructure and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the Growth Management Act and DRI process. In addition,anti-development groups are active, especially in Florida, in seeking legislation and other anti-growth limitations on real estate entitlement and development activities.  Issues affecting real estate development also include the availability of potable water for new development projects. Forexample, in Georgia, the Legislature recently enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act (the Watershed Management Act), which, among other things, created a governmental entity called the Georgia Water Councilwhich was charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature for adoption in 2008. It is unclear at this time how the plan will affect the cost and timing of real estatedevelopment along the I-95 coastal corridor in southern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings.  Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the use and development of real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, andthe identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs, delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.  Changes in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operatingresults.  A number of factors, including changes in demographics, tightening of credit, and aslowing of commercial or residential real estate development, particularly along the I-95 coastal corridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for such properties and negatively affect our results of operations.  In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect ouroperating results. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factors beyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results. Our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us. We participate in a joint venture in New Zealand, and may enter into other joint venture projects;for example, as part of our real estate development strategy. A joint venture involves potential risks such as:      not having voting control over the joint venture;      the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours;   10 Table of Contents    the venture partner may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the investment; and,     the venture partner could experience financial difficulties.  Actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than thosecontemplated by the joint venture agreement or have other adverse consequences.  We may be unsuccessful in carryingout our acquisition strategy.  We have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, acquisitions ofstrategic timberland and real estate properties. Our timberland and real estate acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. We anticipate financing any such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our creditfacilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. The failure to identify and complete acquisitions of suitable timberland and real estate properties, and the failure of anyacquisitions to perform to our expectations, could adversely affect our operating results.  Our failure to maintainsatisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Approximately 45percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are almost exclusively in our Performance Fibers business. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively. Our financialresults could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of our operations. In addition, our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikesor work stoppages by the affected workers. If the unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Weather and other naturalconditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.  Weather conditions, timber growth cycles andrestrictions on access may limit harvesting of our timberlands, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters such as wind storms and hurricanes.  We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire.  The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire, insect infestation,severe weather, disease, natural disasters, and other causes beyond our control. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the industry, we do not maintain insurance for anyloss to our timber, including losses due to these causes.  A significant portion of the timberland that we own, leaseor manage is concentrated in limited geographic areas.  We own, lease or manage approximately2.5 million acres of timberland and real estate located primarily in the United States and New Zealand. Approximately 1.8 million acres are located in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, New York, Oklahoma and Texas.Accordingly, if the level of production from these forests substantially declines, or if the demand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues.  We are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel.  We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior managementand operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Market interest rates may influence the price of our common shares.  One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares is our annual dividend yield as compared to yields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higheryields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common shares.   11 Table of Contents  Wehave a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt.  As ofDecember 31, 2007, we had $750 million of debt outstanding. See Item 7Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsContractual Financial Obligations and Off-Balance SheetArrangements for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, cash provided from operations, and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cashrequirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if we enter into one or more strategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in oneor more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renew credit lines prior to their expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow. REIT and Tax-Related Risks  If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholders because our timber-related income will be subject to taxation.  We intend to operate in accordance with REIT requirements pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (theCode). For example, as a REIT, we generally will not pay corporate-level tax on income we distribute to our shareholders (other than the income of TRS) as long as we distribute at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income (determinedwithout regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gains). Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, andwhich are not entirely within our control. We cannot assure that we will qualify as a REIT or be able to remain so qualified or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantlyaffect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.  Ifin any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will suffer the following negative results:      we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income; and,      we will be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income.  In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during whichthe qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay theadditional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.  Theextent of our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.  We conduct a portion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activitiessuch as the production and sale of performance fibers and wood products, real estate development, sales and development of HBU property and timberlands (as a dealer) and sales of logs. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level tax.Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Under the Code, no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries.This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries operations. Furthermore, our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of otherREITs, which may not use taxable REIT subsidiaries as extensively as we use them.  Lack of shareholder ownership andtransfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of its outstanding voting shares during the last six months ineach calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assurecompliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any   12 Table of Contents  current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent ormore of our outstanding voting shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.  We may be limited inour ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.  Theability for the REIT to receive dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must bederived from passive real estate sources including sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and othernon-qualifying income.  This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REITsubsidiaries may impact our ability to fund distributions to stockholders using cash flows from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The net income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries is not required to be distributed, and income that is not distributed willnot be subject to the 90 percent income distribution requirement.  Certain of our business activities are potentiallysubject to prohibited transactions tax.  As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on anynet income from prohibited transactions. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of performance fibers and wood products which we produce andsales of logs constitute prohibited transactions. In addition, sales of timberlands or other real estate (as a dealer) and certain development activities relating to real estate could, in certain circumstances, constitute prohibited transactions. We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that wouldotherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identify timberland properties that will become part of our dealer real estate sales business. Therefore, if wesell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we face the potentialof being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.  We may have adjustments to deferred and contingenttax liabilities.  The IRS may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxableyears prior to the time we qualified as a REIT, in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties, if any. Moreover, any increase in taxable income for those years will result in an increase in accumulated earnings and profits, orE&P, which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our then-existing shareholders within 90 days of the relevant determination.  Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.  Generally, REITs are required to distribute 90 percent of their taxable income. However, REITs are required to distribute only their ordinary taxable income and not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not believe that we arerequired to distribute material amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to ourstockholders based on consideration of a number of factors. These include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors,including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including thosetimberland properties that have higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.  We may notbe able to complete desired like-kind exchange transactions for property we sell.  When we sellproperty, we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement real estate. This allows us like-kind exchange treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the Code. Thismatching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits, most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property. While we   13 Table of Contents  attempt to complete like-kind exchanges wherever practical, we will not be able to do so in all instances due to various factors, including the lack ofavailability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms, inability to complete a qualifying like-kind exchange transaction within the time frames required by the Code and if we incorrectly identify real estate as property not held for saleto customers in the ordinary course of business or which subsequently becomes real estate held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The inability to obtain like-kind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes withrespect to the property sold, and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends.   "
1,RYN,RAYONIER INC,2007-02-27,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  Our operations aresubject to a number of risks, including those listed below. When considering an investment in our securities, you should carefully read and consider these risks, together with all other information in this report. If any of the events described inthe following risk factors actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results, as well as the market price of our securities, could be materially adversely affected.  Business and Operating Risks  The cyclical nature of our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products and real estate industries. The markets for timber, real estate, performance fibers and wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond ourcontrol. For example, the demand for real estate can be affected by changes in interest rates, local economic conditions, population growth and demographics. The demand for sawtimber is primarily affected by the level of new residential andcommercial construction activity. The supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments, which then causes downward pressure on prices.  The forest products and real estate industries are highly competitive.  Many of our competitors in the forest products businesses have substantially greater financial and operating resources and own more timberlands than we do. Some of our forest products competitors may also belower-cost producers in some   7 Table of Contentsof the businesses in which we operate. In addition, wood products are subject to significant competition from a variety of non-wood and engineered woodproducts. We are also subject to competition from various forest products, including logs, imported from foreign countries to the United States as well as to the export markets served by us. To the extent there is a significant increase incompetitive pressures from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be substantially adversely affected. With respect to our real estate business, we are continuing the transition from a bulk land seller toengaging in value-added real estate development activities, including obtaining entitlements and entering into joint venture, participation and other development-related arrangements. Many of our competitors in this segment have greater experiencein real estate development than we do.  Changes in energy and raw materials prices could impact our operating resultsand financial condition.  Energy and raw material costs, such as oil, natural gas, wood, andchemicals are a significant operating expense, particularly for the Performance Fibers and Wood Products businesses. The prices of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyondour control such as changing economic conditions, political unrest and instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, oil and natural gas costs have increased substantially in recent years and we haveexperienced, at times, a limited availability of hardwood which has resulted in increased production costs for some Performance Fibers products. Increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations.  Changes in global market trends and world events could impact customer demand. The global reach of our business, particularly the Performance Fibers business and our interest inthe New Zealand JV, causes us to be subject to unexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition to those experienced in the U.S. Adverse changes in the following factors, among others, could have a negative impacton our business and results of operations:      effects of exposure to currencies other than the United States dollar;      regulatory, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and      trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions fortaxes and tariffs, and import and export licensing requirements.  Our businesses are subject toextensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.  If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of operations could be delayed or restricted. In connection with a variety of operations on our properties, we are requiredto seek permission from agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities. Any of these agencies could delay review of, or reject, any of our filings. In our Timber business, any delay associated with a filingcould result in a delay or restriction in replanting, thinning, insect control, fire control or harvesting, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, in Washington State, we are required to file a ForestPractice Application for each unit of timberland to be harvested. These applications may be denied, conditioned or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizen groups. Appeals or actions of the regulatoryagencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In our Performance Fibers and WoodProducts businesses, many modifications and capital projects at our manufacturing facilities require an environmental permit, or an amendment to an existing permit. Delays in obtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations.  Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety ofoperations. We expect that environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands, and operate mills. Forexample, in Washington State, environmental groups and interested individuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices areapproved. These and other challenges could materially delay or prevent operations on our properties. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. Inaddition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups and individuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from obtaining permits or implementing capital improvements or our operating plans. Any lawsuit oreven a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands. Among the remedies that could be enforced in a lawsuit is a judgment preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands, or adversely affecting the projectedoperating benefits or cost of capital projects at our mills.   8 Table of ContentsThe impact of existing regulatory restrictions on future harvestingactivities may be significant. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as well as waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timberharvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species or significantly degrade its habitat. The size of the areasubject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number of species that naturally live on or near our timberlands,including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, red hill salamander, and flatwoods salamander in the Southeast, areprotected under the Federal Endangered Species Act or similar state laws. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if regulations become more restrictive, the amount of ourtimberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.  Our manufacturing operations, and inparticular our Performance Fibers and Wood Products mills, are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal. Many of our operations aresubject to stringent environmental laws and regulations and permits which contain conditions that govern how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations and permits, now and in the future,may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, these costs will likely increase over time asenvironmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent, and as the expectations of the communities in which we operate become more demanding.  We currently own or may acquire properties which may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject toenvironmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations, or may acquire timberlands and other properties, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as cleanupof hazardous material contamination and other existing or potential liabilities of which we are not currently aware. The cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increase operating costs and adversely affect financialresults. Although we believe we have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediation of our current properties, there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed our expectations.  Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive. Laws,regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affect ourability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturing facilities and/or develop real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands, endangered species, timber harvesting practices,recreation and aesthetics, protection and restoration of natural resources, air and water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity and stringency of these laws and regulations haveincreased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. We believe that these laws and regulations will continue to become more restrictive and over time could adversely affect our operating results.  Development of real estate entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process.  Development of real estate entails extensive approval processes involving multiple regulatory jurisdictions. It is commonfor a project to require various approvals, permits and consents from federal, state and local governing and regulatory bodies. For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Local GovernmentComprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the Growth Management Act) and local land use and development regulations. In addition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholdsrequire approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (DRI) application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, local land development regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can beimposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. In addition, development of properties containing delineated wetlands may require one or more permits from the federal government. Any of these issues can materially affect the cost andtiming of our real estate development activities.  The real estate development and entitlement process isfrequently a political one, which involves uncertainty and often extensive negotiation and concessions in order to secure the necessary approvals and permits. A significant amount of our development property is located in counties in which localgovernments face challenging issues relating to growth and development, including zoning and future land use, public services, infrastructure and funding for same, and the requirements of state law, especially in the case of Florida under the GrowthManagement Act and DRI process.   9 Table of ContentsOther issues affecting real estate development include the availabilityof potable water for new development projects. For example, in Georgia, the Legislature recently enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act (the Watershed Management Act), which, among other things, created agovernmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which is charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature for adoption no later than 2008. It is unclear at this time whatthis plan will provide or how it will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the I-95 coastal corridor in southern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings.  Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the use and developmentof real estate, changes in the political composition of state and local governmental bodies, and the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs, delays and liabilities that could materially adverselyaffect our business, profitability or financial condition.  Changes in demand for our real estate and delays in thetiming of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results.  A number offactors, including changes in demographics, and a slowing of commercial or residential real estate development, particularly along the I-95 coastal corridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for such properties and negatively affectour results of operations.  In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estatetransactions that could adversely affect our operating results. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factors beyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the futureadversely affect our operating results.  Our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and maytake actions that adversely affect us.  We participate in a joint venture in New Zealand, and mayenter into other joint venture projects; for example, as part of our real estate development strategy. A joint venture involves potential risks such as:      not having voting control over the joint venture;      the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours;      the venture partner may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the investment; and     the venture partner could experience financial difficulties.  Actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than thosecontemplated by the joint venture agreement or have other adverse consequences.  We may be unsuccessful in carryingout, our acquisition strategy.  We intend to pursue acquisitions of strategic timberland and realestate properties. Our timberland and real estate acquisitions may not perform in accordance with our expectations. We anticipate financing any such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds fromequity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or any combination thereof. The failure of any acquisitions to perform to our expectations could adversely affect our operating results.  Our failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Approximately 45 percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are almost exclusively in our Performance Fibersbusiness. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict the efficiency of ouroperations. Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. If the unionized employees were to engage in a strike or other workstoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  Weather and other natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.  Weather conditions, timber growth cycles and restrictions on access may limit harvesting of our timberlands, as may otherfactors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters.   10 Table of ContentsWe do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire. The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire,insect infestation, severe weather, disease, natural disasters, and other causes beyond our control. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the industry, we do not maintaininsurance for any loss to our timber, including losses due to these causes.  A significant portion of the timberlandthat we own, lease or manage is concentrated in limited geographic areas.  We own, lease or manageapproximately 2.7 million acres of timberland and real estate located primarily in the United States and New Zealand. Approximately 1.7 million acres are located in Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma.Accordingly, if the level of production from these forests substantially declines, or if the demand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues.  We are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel.  We believe that our success depends, to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior managementand operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, W. Lee Nutter has publiclyannounced his plan to retire in 2007. Although a search is currently underway for Mr. Nutters successor, no assurances can be given to the effect his replacement will have on our results of operations, financial condition, or stock price. Market interest rates may influence the price of our common shares.  One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares will be the annual dividend yield as compared toyields on other financial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common shares.  We have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt.  As of December 31, 2006, we had $661 million of debt outstanding. See Item 7  ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual Financial Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cashequivalents, marketable securities, cash provided from operations, and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if weenter into one or more strategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renewcredit lines prior to their expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.  REIT and Tax-RelatedRisks  If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds availablefor distribution to our shareholders because our income will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates.  We intend to operate in accordance with REIT qualifications under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). As a REIT, we generally will not pay corporate-level tax on income we distributeto our shareholders (other than the income of TRS) as long as we distribute at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gain). Qualification as a REITinvolves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are not entirely within our control. We cannot assure that we will qualify as a REIT or be able to remainso qualified or that new legislation, U.S. Treasury regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification. If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will suffer the following negative results:     we will not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to shareholders in computing our taxable income; and      we will be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during whichthe qualification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the cash available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer.  11 Table of ContentsIf we fail to qualify as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidatesome investments or assets to pay the additional tax liability. Accordingly, cash available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.  The extent of our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.  We conduct a portion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REITsubsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of performance fibers and wood products, real estate development, sales and development of HBU property and timberlands (as a dealer) andsales of logs. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to corporate-level tax. Therefore, we pay income taxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Under the Code, no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REITmay be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries operations. Furthermore, our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may cause themarket to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not use taxable REIT subsidiaries as extensively as we use them.  Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles of incorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot have five or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly afterapplying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of its outstanding voting shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or the REIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adoptedownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of the ownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plansto adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent or more of our outstanding voting shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT. We may be limited in our ability to fund distributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.  The ability for the REIT to receive dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries is limited by the rules with which we mustcomply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from sales of our standing timber and other types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other non-qualifying income.  This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries may impact our ability to fund distributions to stockholders using cash flows from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. The net incomeof our taxable REIT subsidiaries is not required to be distributed, and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the 90 percent income distribution requirement.  Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.  As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from prohibited transactions. In general, prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property tocustomers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of performance fibers and wood products which we produce and sales of logs constitute prohibited transactions. In addition, sales of timberlands or other real estate (as a dealer) and certaindevelopment activities relating to real estate could, in certain circumstances, constitute prohibited transactions.  We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identifytimberland properties that will become part of our dealer real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or whichsubsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we face the potential of being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.  We may have adjustments to deferred and contingent tax liabilities.  We will be subject to a federal corporate-level tax at the highest regular corporate rate (currently 35 percent) on anygain recognized from a taxable sale of any asset which we held at January 1, 2004, the effective date of our REIT election,   12 Table of Contentsthat occurs within ten years of that date. However, we will be subject to such tax only to the extent of the difference between our tax basis and the fairmarket value of those assets as of January 1, 2004 (the built-in-gain). Gain from a taxable sale of those assets occurring more than ten years after January 1, 2004 will not be subject to this corporate-level tax. In addition, the IRS may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable years prior to the timewe qualified as a REIT, in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties, if any. Moreover, any increase in taxable income for those years will result in an increase in accumulated earnings and profits, or E&P, which could causeus to pay an additional taxable distribution to our then-existing shareholders within 90 days of the relevant determination.  Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.  Generally, REITs arerequired to distribute 90 percent of their taxable income. However, REITs are required to distribute only their ordinary taxable income and not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are required to distributematerial amounts of cash since substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our stockholders based onconsideration of a number of factors. These include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenantrestrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties thathave higher and better uses. Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.  We may not be able to complete desiredlike-kind exchange transactions for timberlands and real estate we sell.  When we sell timberlandsand real estate, we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitable replacement real estate. This allows us to claim like-kind exchange treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations ofthe Code. This matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits, most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property. For example, we frequently utilizelike-kind exchanges to transfer HBU properties from RFR to TerraPointe. While we attempt to complete like-kind exchanges wherever practical, we will not be able to do so in all instances due to various factors, including the lack of availability ofsuitable replacement property on acceptable terms, inability to complete a qualifying like-kind exchange transaction within the timeframes required by the Code and if we incorrectly identify real estate as property not held for sale to customers inthe ordinary course of business or which subsequently becomes real estate held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business. The inability to obtain like-kind exchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to theproperty sold, and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends.   "

If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operatingresults as well as the market price of our securities could be materially adversely affected.  Business and Operating Risks  The cyclical nature of our businesses could adversely affect our results of operations.  Our financial performance is affected by the cyclical nature of the forest products and real estate industries. The markets for timber,real estate, cellulose specialties products and wood products are influenced by a variety of factors beyond our control. For example, the demand for real estate can be affected by changes in interest rates, local economic conditions and populationgrowth and demographics; the demand for saw timber is primarily affected by the level of new residential and commercial construction activity, while supply of timber and logs has historically increased during favorable pricing environments. Changes in global market trends and world events could impact customer demand.  The global reach of our business, particularly our Performance Fibers business and our interest in the JV, causes us to be subject tounexpected, uncontrollable and rapidly changing events and circumstances in addition to those experienced in the U.S. Adverse changes in the following factors, among others, could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations:    effects of exposure to currency other than the United States dollar;     regulatory, social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region; and     trade protection laws, policies and measures and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment, including loss or modification of exemptions for taxes and tariffs,and import and export licensing requirements.  The forest products and real estate industries are highly competitive. Many of our competitors in the forest products businesses have substantially greater financial and operatingresources and own more timberlands than we do. Some of our forest products competitors may also be lower-cost producers in some of the businesses in which we operate. In addition, wood products are subject to significant competition from a varietyof non-wood and engineered wood products. We are also subject to competition from forest products, including logs, imported from foreign sources to the United States as well as to the export markets served by us. To the extent there is a significantincrease in competitive pressures from substitute products or other domestic or foreign suppliers, our business could be substantially adversely affected. With respect to our real estate business, we are currently transitioning from a bulk landseller to obtaining entitlements and initiating improvements through partnerships with other developers. As a result, many of our competitors in this segment have greater experience in real estate development than we do.  Changes in energy and raw materials prices could impact our operating results and financial condition.  Energy and raw material costs, such as oil, natural gas, wood, and chemicals are a significant operating expense, particularly for ourPerformance Fibers and Wood Products businesses. The prices of raw materials and energy can be volatile and are susceptible to rapid and substantial increases due to factors beyond our control such as changing economic conditions, political unrestand instability in energy-producing nations, and supply and demand considerations. For example, oil and natural gas costs have increased substantially in recent years and we have recently experienced, at times, a limited availability of hardwoodwhich has resulted in increased production costs for some Performance Fibers products. Increases in production costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Our businesses are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations that may restrict or adversely impact our ability to conduct ourbusiness.  If regulatory and environmental permits are delayed, restricted or rejected, a variety of operationson our timberlands could be delayed or restricted. In connection with a variety of operations on our properties, we are required to seek   7 Table of Contentspermission from agencies in the states and countries in which we operate to perform certain activities.

These applications may be denied or restricted by the regulatory agency or appealed by other parties, including citizengroups. Appeals or actions of the regulatory agencies could delay or restrict timber harvest activities pursuant to these permits. Delays or harvest restrictions on a significant number of applications could have an adverse effect on our operatingresults. In addition, many of our capital projects require various environmental permits. Delays in obtaining these permits could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.  Environmental groups and interested individuals may seek to delay or prevent a variety of operations on our timberlands. We expectthat environmental groups and interested individuals will intervene with increasing frequency in the regulatory processes in the states and countries where we own, lease or manage timberlands. In Washington State, environmental groups and interestedindividuals may appeal individual forest practice applications or file petitions with the Forest Practices Board to challenge the regulations under which forest practices are approved. These and other challenges could materially delay or preventoperations on our properties. Delays or restrictions due to the intervention of environmental groups or interested individuals could adversely affect our operating results. In addition to intervention in regulatory proceedings, interested groups andindividuals may file or threaten to file lawsuits that seek to prevent us from implementing our operating plans. Any lawsuit or even a threatened lawsuit could delay harvesting on our timberlands. Among the remedies that could be enforced in alawsuit is a judgment entirely preventing or restricting harvesting on a portion of our timberlands.  The impact ofexisting regulatory restrictions on future harvesting activities may be underestimated. Federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, which are intended to protect threatened and endangered species, as wellas waterways and wetlands, limit and may prevent timber harvesting, road building and other activities on our timberlands. The threatened and endangered species restrictions apply to activities that would adversely impact a protected species orsignificantly degrade its habitat. The size of the area subject to restriction will vary depending on the protected species at issue, the time of year and other factors, but can range from less than one to several thousand acres. A number of speciesthat naturally live on or near our timberlands, including the northern spotted owl, marbled murrelet, bald eagle, several species of salmon and trout in the Northwest, and the red cockaded woodpecker, bald eagle, wood stork, red hill salamander, andflatwoods salamander in the Southeast, are protected under the Federal Endangered Species Act or similar state laws. As we gain additional information regarding the presence of threatened or endangered species on our timberlands, or if regulationsbecome more restrictive, the amount of our timberlands subject to harvest restrictions could increase.  Ourmanufacturing operations, and in particular our Performance Fibers and Wood Products mills, are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations concerning air emissions, wastewater discharge, water usage and waste handling and disposal.Many of our operations are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations and permits which contain conditions that govern how we operate our facilities and, in many cases, how much product we can produce. These laws, regulations andpermits, now and in the future, may restrict our current production and limit our ability to increase production, and impose significant costs on our operations with respect to environmental compliance. It is expected that, overall, these costs willlikely increase over time as environmental laws, regulations and permit conditions become more stringent.  We currentlyown or may acquire properties which may require environmental remediation or otherwise be subject to environmental and other liabilities. We currently own, or formerly operated, manufacturing facilities and discontinued operations, or mayacquire timberlands and other properties, which are subject to environmental liabilities, such as cleanup of hazardous material contamination and other existing or potential liabilities of which we are not currently aware. While timberlands withoutany prior history of industrial development do not generally carry as high a risk of environmental contamination as current and former manufacturing operations, the cost of investigation and remediation of contaminated properties could increaseoperating costs and adversely affect financial results. Although we believe we have adequate reserves for the investigation and remediation of our current properties, there can be no assurance that actual expenditures will not exceed ourexpectations.  Environmental laws and regulations are constantly changing, and are generally becoming more restrictive.Laws, regulations and related judicial decisions and administrative interpretations affecting our business are subject to change and new laws and regulations that may affect our business are frequently enacted. These changes may adversely affectour ability to harvest and sell timber, operate our manufacturing facilities and/or develop real estate. These laws and regulations may relate to, among other things, the protection of timberlands, endangered species, timber harvesting   8 Table of Contentspractices, recreation and aesthetics, air and water quality, and remedial standards for contaminated property and groundwater. Over time, the complexity andstringency of these laws and regulations have increased markedly and the enforcement of these laws and regulations has intensified. We believe that these laws and regulations will continue to become more restrictive and over time could adverselyaffect our operating results.  Development of real estate entails a lengthy, uncertain and costly approval process. Development of real estate entails an extensive approval process involving overlapping regulatory jurisdictions.For example, in Florida, real estate projects must generally comply with the provisions of the Local Government Comprehensive Planning and Land Development Regulation Act (the Growth Management Act) and local land use and developmentregulations. In addition, in Florida, development projects that exceed certain specified regulatory thresholds require approval of a comprehensive Development of Regional Impact (DRI) application. Compliance with the Growth Management Act, localland development regulations and the DRI process is usually lengthy and costly and significant conditions can be imposed on a developer with respect to a particular project. Any of these issues can be expected to materially affect the cost andtiming of our real estate development activities.  Other issues affecting real estate development include the availabilityof potable water for new development projects. For example, in Georgia, the Legislature recently enacted the Comprehensive Statewide Watershed Management Planning Act (the Watershed Management Act), which, among other things, created agovernmental entity called the Georgia Water Council which is charged with preparing a comprehensive water management plan for the state and presenting it to the Georgia Legislature for adoption no later than 2008. It is unclear at this time whatthis plan will provide or how it will affect the cost and timing of real estate development along the I-95 coastal corridor in southern Georgia, where the Company has significant real estate holdings.  Changes in the interpretation or enforcement of these laws, the enactment of new laws regarding the use and development of real estate,or the identification of new facts regarding our properties could lead to new or greater costs, delays and liabilities that could materially adversely affect our business, profitability or financial condition.  Changes in demand for our real estate and delays in the timing of real estate transactions may affect our revenues and operating results. A number of factors, including changes in demographics, a slowing of commercial or residential real estate development,particularly along the I-95 coastal corridor in Florida and Georgia, could reduce the demand for such properties and negatively affect our results of operations.  In addition, there are inherent uncertainties in the timing of real estate transactions that could adversely affect our operatingresults. Delays in the completion of transactions or the termination of potential transactions can be caused by factors beyond our control. These events have in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operating results.  Our joint venture partners may have interests that differ from ours and may take actions that adversely affect us.  We participate in a joint venture in New Zealand, and may enter into other joint venture projects; for example, as part of our real estatedevelopment strategy. A joint venture involves special risks such as:     not having voting control over the joint venture;     the venture partner at any time may have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with ours;     the venture partner may take actions contrary to our instructions or requests, or contrary to our policies or objectives with respect to the investment; and    the venture partner could experience financial difficulties.  Actions by our venture partners may subject property owned by the joint venture to liabilities greater than those contemplated by the joint venture agreement or have other adverse consequences.  We may be unsuccessful in carrying out our acquisition strategy.  We intend to pursue acquisitions of strategic timberland and real estate properties. Our timberland and real estate acquisitions may notperform in accordance with our expectations. We anticipate financing any such acquisitions through cash from operations, borrowings under our credit facilities, proceeds from equity or debt offerings or proceeds from asset dispositions, or anycombination thereof. Our inability to finance acquisitions on favorable terms or the failure of any acquisitions to perform to our expectations, could adversely affect our operating results.   9 Table of ContentsOur failure to maintain satisfactory labor relations could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.  Approximately 45 percent of our work force is unionized. These workers are almost exclusively in ourPerformance Fibers business. As a result, we are required to negotiate the wages, benefits and other terms with many of our employees collectively. Our financial results could be adversely affected if labor negotiations were to restrict theefficiency of our operations. Our inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with any of these unions as existing agreements expire could result in strikes or work stoppages by the affected workers. If the unionized employees were to engage in astrike or other work stoppage, or other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We have a significant amount of debt and the capacity to incur significant additional debt.  As of December 31, 2005, we had $559 million of debt outstanding. See Item 7  Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Contractual Financial Obligations and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements for the payment schedule of our long-term debt obligations. We expect that existing cash, cash equivalents,marketable securities, cash provided from operations, and our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to meet ongoing cash requirements. Moreover, we have the borrowing capacity to incur significant additional debt and may do so if we enter intoone or more strategic, merger, acquisition or other corporate or investment opportunities, or otherwise invest capital in one or more of our businesses. However, failure to generate sufficient cash as our debt becomes due, or to renew credit linesprior to their expiration, may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flow.  Weather andother natural conditions may limit our timber harvest and sales.  Weather conditions, timber growth cycles andrestrictions on access may limit harvesting of our timberlands, as may other factors, including damage by fire, insect infestation, disease, prolonged drought and natural disasters.  We do not insure against losses of timber from any causes, including fire.  The volume and value of timber that can be harvested from our timberlands may be reduced by fire, insect infestation, severe weather,disease, natural disasters, and other causes beyond our control. A reduction in our timber inventory could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows. As is typical in the industry, we do not maintain insurance for any loss to our timber,including losses due to these causes.  A significant portion of the timberland that we own, lease or manage is concentrated inlimited geographic areas.  We own, lease or manage approximately 2.5 million acres of timberland and realestate located primarily in the United States and New Zealand. Approximately 1.6 million acres are located principally in Georgia, Florida and Alabama. Accordingly, if the level of production from these forests substantially declines, or if thedemand for timber in those regions declines, it could have a material adverse effect on our overall production levels and our revenues.  We are dependent upon attracting and retaining key personnel.  We believe that our success depends,to a significant extent, upon our ability to attract and retain key senior management and operations management personnel. Our failure to recruit and retain these key personnel could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Market interest rates may influence the price of our common shares.  One of the factors that may influence the price of our common shares will be the annual dividend yield as compared to yields on otherfinancial instruments. Thus, an increase in market interest rates will result in higher yields on other financial instruments, which could adversely affect the price of our common shares.  REIT and Tax-Related Risks    If we fail to qualify as a REIT or fail to remain qualified as a REIT, we will have reduced funds available for distribution to our shareholdersbecause our income will be subject to taxation at regular corporate rates.  We intend to operate in accordance withREIT qualifications under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). As a REIT, we generally will not pay corporate-level tax on income we distribute to our shareholders (other than the income of TRS) as long as wedistribute at least 90 percent of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding net capital gain). Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions ofthe Code, which are subject to change, perhaps retroactively, and which are   10 Table of Contentsnot entirely within our control. We cannot assure that we will qualify as a REIT or be able to remain so qualified or that new legislation, U.S. Treasuryregulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not significantly affect our ability to qualify as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification.  If in any taxable year we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will suffer the following negative results:     we will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income; and     we will be subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we will be disqualified from treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which thequalification was lost, unless we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the Code. As a result, our net income and the funds available for distribution to our shareholders could be reduced for up to five years or longer.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we may need to borrow funds or liquidate some investments or assets to pay the additional tax liability.Accordingly, funds available for distribution to our shareholders would be reduced.  The extent of our use of taxable REITsubsidiaries may affect the price of our common shares relative to the share price of other REITs.  We conduct aportion of our business activities through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. Our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries enables us to engage in non-REIT qualifying business activities such as the production and sale of performance fibers and woodproducts, real estate development, sales and development of HBU property and timberlands (as a dealer), sales of logs and lump-sum sales of timber. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are corporations subject to corporate-level tax. Therefore, we pay incometaxes on the income generated by our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Under the Code, no more than 20 percent of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. This limitation may affectour ability to increase the size of our taxable REIT subsidiaries operations. Furthermore, our use of taxable REIT subsidiaries may cause the market to value our common shares differently than the shares of other REITs, which may not usetaxable REIT subsidiaries as extensively as we use them.  Lack of shareholder ownership and transfer restrictions in our articles ofincorporation may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  In order to qualify as a REIT, an entity cannot havefive or fewer individuals who own, directly or indirectly after applying attribution of ownership rules, 50 percent or more of its outstanding voting shares during the last six months in each calendar year. Although it is not required by law or theREIT provisions of the Code, almost all REITs have adopted ownership and transfer restrictions in their articles of incorporation or organizational documents which seek to assure compliance with that rule. While we are not in violation of theownership rules, we do not have, nor do we have any current plans to adopt, share ownership and transfer restrictions. As such, the possibility exists, however remote, that five or fewer individuals could acquire 50 percent or more of ouroutstanding voting shares, which could result in our disqualification as a REIT.  We may be limited in our ability to funddistributions using cash generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries.  Our ability to receive dividends from ourtaxable REIT subsidiaries is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our status as a REIT. In particular, at least 75 percent of gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from sales of our standing timber andother types of qualifying real estate income and no more than 25 percent of our gross income may consist of dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries and other non-qualifying income.  This limitation on our ability to receive dividends from our taxable REIT subsidiaries may impact our ability to fund distributions tostockholders using cash flows from our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Despite these restrictions, we have the ability to transfer cash from our taxable REIT subsidiaries to our REIT through intercompany real estate sales. However, these transactionswould be subject to federal income tax. The net income of our taxable REIT subsidiaries is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed will not be subject to the 90 percent income distribution requirement.  Certain of our business activities are potentially subject to prohibited transactions tax.  As a REIT, we will be subject to a 100 percent tax on any net income from prohibited transactions. In general, prohibitedtransactions are sales or other dispositions of property to customers in the ordinary course of business. Sales of   11 Table of Contentsperformance fibers and wood products which we produce, sales of logs and lump-sum sales of timber, sales of timberlands or other real estate (as a dealer)and certain development activities relating to real estate, could, in certain circumstances, constitute prohibited transactions.  We intend to avoid the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax by conducting activities that would otherwise be prohibited transactions through one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries. We may not, however, always be able to identifytimberland properties that will become part of our dealer real estate sales business. Therefore, if we sell timberlands which we incorrectly identify as property not held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or whichsubsequently become properties held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, we face the potential of being subject to the 100 percent prohibited transactions tax.  We will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.  We will be subject to a federal corporate-level tax at the highest regular corporate rate (currently 35 percent) on any gain recognizedfrom a taxable sale of any asset which we held at January 1, 2004, the effective date of our REIT status election, that occurs within ten years of that date. However, we will be subject to such tax only to the extent of the difference betweenour tax basis and the fair market value of those assets as of January 1, 2004 (the built-in-gain). Gain from a taxable sale of those assets occurring more than ten years after January 1, 2004 will not be subject to thiscorporate-level tax.  In addition, the IRS may assert liabilities against us for corporate income taxes for taxable yearsprior to the time we qualified as a REIT, in which case we will owe these taxes plus interest and penalties, if any. Moreover, any increase in taxable income for those years will result in an increase in accumulated earnings and profits, or E&P,which could cause us to pay an additional taxable distribution to our then-existing shareholders within 90 days of the relevant determination.  Our cash dividends are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.  Generally, REITs are required to distribute90 percent of their taxable income. However, REITs are required to distribute only their ordinary taxable income and not their net capital gains income. Accordingly, we do not believe that we are required to distribute material amounts of cash giventhat substantially all of our taxable income is treated as capital gains income. Our Board of Directors, in its sole discretion, determines the amount of quarterly dividends to be provided to our stockholders based on consideration of a number offactors. These include, but are not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may imposelimitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, harvest levels, changes in the price and demand for our products and general market demand for timberlands including those timberland properties that have higher and better uses.Consequently, our dividend levels may fluctuate.  We may not be able to complete like-kind exchange transactions for all real estatewe sell.  When we sell real estate, we generally seek to match these sales with the acquisition of suitablereplacement real estate. This allows us to claim like-kind exchange treatment for these transactions under section 1031 and related regulations of the Code. This matching of sales and purchases provides us with significant tax benefits,most importantly the deferral of any gain on the property sold until ultimate disposition of the replacement property. While we attempt to complete like-kind exchanges wherever practical, we will not be able to do so in all instances due to variousfactors, including the lack of availability of suitable replacement property on acceptable terms and inability to complete a qualifying like-kind exchange transaction within the timeframes required by the Code. The inability to obtain like-kindexchange treatment would result in the payment of taxes with respect to the property sold, and a corresponding reduction in earnings and cash available for distribution to shareholders as dividends"
