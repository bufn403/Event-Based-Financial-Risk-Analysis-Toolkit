7,FHN,FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP,2022-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSTable of Contentswithout regulatory approval. Applying the dividend restrictions imposed under applicable federal and state rules, the Bank’s total amount available for dividends, without obtaining regulatory approval, was $1.1 billion at January 1, 2022. Also, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank. Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may need to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable for dividends.Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company’s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Our shareholders may suffer dilution if we raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current common shareholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current shareholders. We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that would be dilutive to shareholders in terms of voting power and share-of-ownership, and could be dilutive financially or economically. The IBKC merger, for example, resulted in a significant increase in our outstanding shares. In 2020, we issued to former IBKC shareholders common shares representing about 44% of our post-closing outstanding shares. Our issuance of preferred stock raises regulatory capital without issuing common shares, but creates or expands our general obligation to pay all preferred dividends ahead of any common dividends. Currently we have six series of preferred stock outstanding, one issued by the Bank and five by First Horizon Corporation. Subject to capital needs and market conditions, additional series may be issued in the future.Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our shareholders. In addition, federal banking laws prohibit non-financial-industry companies from owning a bank, and require regulatory approval of any change in control of a bank.Certain legal rights of holders of our common stock and of depositary shares related to our preferred stock to pursue claims against us or the depositary, as applicable, are limited by our bylaws and by the terms of the deposit agreements. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, a state or federal court located within Shelby County in the State of Tennessee will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought in our right or name, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other associate of ours to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer or other associate of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act, of our charter or bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer or other associate of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, each deposit agreement between us and the depositary, which govern the rights of the depositary shares related to our Series B, C, and D preferred stock, provide that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating in any way to the deposit agreement may only be brought in a state court located in the State of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The foregoing exclusive forum clauses may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors, officers or other associates, or against the depositary, as applicable. Exclusive forum clauses may also lead to increased costs to bring a claim, or may limit the ability of holders of our common stock or depositary shares to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable. In addition, the exclusive forum clauses in our bylaws and deposit agreement could apply to actions or proceedings that may arise under the federal securities laws, depending on the nature of the claim alleged.

Our primary areas of competition include: consumer and commercial deposits, commercial loans, consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, financial planning and wealth management, fixed income products and services, title insurance services, and other consumer and commercial financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies that serve in our markets. The emergence of non-traditional, disruptive service providers (see Industry Disruption beginning on page 28) has intensified the competitive environment. Some competitors are traditional banks, subject to the same regulatory framework as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation. Examples of less-regulated activities include check-cashing services, independent ATM services, and “peer-to-peer” lending, where investors provide debt financing and/or capital directly to borrowers. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition for clients, refer to Competition within Item 1 beginning on page 13 of this report.We compete for talent. Our most significant competitors for clients also tend to be our most significant competitors for top talent. See Operational Risks beginning on page 30 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.We compete to raise capital in the equity and debt markets. See Liquidity and Funding Risks beginning on page 39 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.Traditional Strategic and Macro RisksWe may be unable to successfully implement our strategy to grow our commercial and consumer banking businesses and our fixed income business. Although our current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions change, in 2021 our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking businesses as we integrate the businesses and operations of First Horizon and IBKC, and seek to exploit opportunities for cost and revenue synergies. Organic growth, including exploitation of revenue synergies, is expected to be coordinated with a focus on strong and stable returns on capital. Organically, we have enhanced our market share in our traditional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into other southern U.S. markets with similar characteristics, and expanded with specialty commercial lending and private client banking. In the future, we expect to continue to nurture profitable organic growth. We may pursue acquisitions or strategic transactions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves.  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  272020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of ContentsFailure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful organic growth would adversely affect our business and earnings. We believe that the successful execution of organic growth depends upon a number of key elements, including:•our ability to attract and retain clients in our banking market areas, particularly as we integrate First Horizon and IBKC;•our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities;•our ability to maintain a high level of client service while optimizing our physical banking center count due to changing client demand, all while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information processing, technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; •our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-funded acquisitions; and•our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex, burdensome, and evolving regulatory environment.We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change.Failure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful business acquisitions would adversely affect our business and earnings. In relation to the IBKC merger and the 30-branch acquisition closed in 2020, and to the extent we engage in future bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various additional risks, including:•our ability to realize planned strategic and tactical objectives, including operating efficiencies and revenue synergies, within a reasonable time period after closing the transaction; •our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;•our ability to properly evaluate loss inherent in the target business’ loan portfolios;•our ability to integrate the acquired business’ operations, clients, and properties quickly and cost-effectively;•our ability to manage cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions, which can be an often-overlooked and often-critical failure point in mergers; •our ability to combine the franchise values of the two companies without significant loss from re-branding and other similar changes; and•our ability to retain core clients and key associates.A type of strategic acquisition—a so-called “merger of equals” where the company we nominally acquire has similar size, operating contribution, or value—presents unique opportunities but also unique risks. Those special risks, which continue to be present in relation to the IBKC transaction, include:•the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies efficiently in a reasonable amount of time; and•the potential for a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before substantial economies of scale can be realized or substantial revenue synergies can be developed effectively.Industry DisruptionThrough technological innovations and changes in client habits, the manner in which clients use financial services continues to change at a rapid pace. We provide a large number of services remotely (online and mobile), and physical banking center utilization has been in long-term decline throughout the industry for many years. Technology has helped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has weakened traditional geographic and relationship ties, and has allowed disruptors to enter traditional banking areas. Through digital marketing and service platforms, many banks are making client inroads unrelated to physical presence. This competitive risk is especially pronounced from the largest U.S. banks, and from online-only banks, due in part to the investments they are able to sustain in their digital platforms. Companies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse) and Starbucks (a large chain of cafes) provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible traditionally. Recently, some government leaders have discussed having the U.S. Post Office offer banking services.The nature of technology-driven disruption to our industry is changing, in some cases seeking to displace traditional financial service providers  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  282020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsrather than merely enhance traditional services or their delivery. A number of recent technologies have worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of delivering those services. But some recent innovations may tend to replace traditional banks as financial service providers rather than merely augment those services. For example, companies which claim to offer applications and services based on artificial intelligence are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personal advice, including high-margin services such as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these “robo-advisor” services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent clients and potential clients, as well as persons interested in “self-service” investment management. Other industry changes, such as zero-commission trading offered by certain large firms able to use trading as a loss-leader, may amplify this trend.Similarly, inventions based on blockchain technology eventually may be the foundation for greatly enhancing transactional security throughout the banking industry, but also eventually may reduce the need for banks as secure deposit-keepers and intermediaries.We believe that, over the course of the technology-driven evolution of our industry which is well underway, the “winners” will be those institutions which can know their clients and make those clients feel they are known, even when many clients increasingly do not visit banking centers or have face-to-face live interaction. Two keys to achieving a psychological connection with such clients are (1) data management and analytics, using artificial intelligence processes, which allow an institution to provide a differentiated, personalized experience for the client at the point of interaction, and (2) seamless integration of real-time client contact with a human being through voice, chat, or other means. A critical factor in successful data analytics, allowing real-time differentiated interaction with clients, is how traditionally uncaptured, unstructured, or siloed data is acquired, managed, and accessed. Some banks are experimenting with different methods of addressing this business need, and more will follow. In addition, external vendors are developing processes to provide solutions. A basic challenge for all these efforts is how to integrate analysis of extremely disparate forms of data and utilize that analysis in each client contact in a manner which most clients not only accept, but value.Developing workable proprietary solutions to the data analytics challenges ahead of competitors requires substantial investment in information technology systems and innovation. Even with a substantial IT budget, we cannot outspend, or even come close to matching, the largest U.S. banking institutions. Therefore, like most U.S. banks, our strategy must be focused on leveraging products and solutions which are within our means, including those developed by external vendors. Our goal must be to keep pace with industry developments with a focus on improving the client’s differentiated experience with us by recognizing and responding to client needs. Technological innovation has tended to reduce barriers to entry based on cost. Put another way, once someone finds a new, better method to accomplish a task in our industry, often others are able to replicate or improve on that method, sometimes quite rapidly. Key risks for us, therefore, are whether we will be able: to catch up to breakthroughs quickly enough to avoid client attrition; to adopt and enhance breakthroughs frequently enough, and without significant technical failures, to attract clients from competitors; and, if we are able to truly innovate, to press our advantage quickly before competitors adopt it.To thrive as our industry is disrupted, we will need to embrace some of the attitudes of a technology company, and shed some of the attitudes of a traditional bank. This has required, and will continue to require, an evolution in our corporate culture which, in turn, creates implementation risk. In this process it is critical that we not lose sight of how our clients experience working with us and our systems, including those clients who still want traditionally-delivered services, those who seek and embrace the latest innovations, and those who just want services to be convenient, personalized, and understandable.Just as disruptive business changes driven by new technologies and new client preferences can adversely impact us and our entire industry, similar events can adversely impact our commercial clients. In time, a major business disruption can cause dominant businesses to fail, and can shrink or even end entire lines of business. An example of this is the business failure of the Blockbuster video distribution chain and most other video distribution stores, and the rise of Netflix and similar services. Many other examples of this kind of process are ongoing today in many industries, including publishing, retail sales, news, and the creation as well as distribution of audio and video entertainment. To the extent disruptions impact our  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  292020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsclients, we may experience elevated loan losses and loss of ongoing business which we may not be able to recapture with new clients.Operational RisksFraud is a major, and increasing, operational risk for us and all banks. Two traditional areas, deposit fraud (check kiting, wire fraud, etc.) and loan fraud, continue to be major sources of fraud attempts and loss. The methods used to perpetrate and combat fraud continue to evolve as technology changes. In addition to cybersecurity risk (discussed below), new technologies have made it easier for bad actors to obtain and use client personal information, mimic signatures, and otherwise create false documents that look genuine.Our anti-fraud actions are both preventive (anticipating lines of attack, educating associates and clients, etc.) and responsive (remediating actual attacks). Our regulators require us to report fraud promptly, and regulators often advise banks of new schemes so that the entire industry can adapt as quickly as possible. However, some level of fraud loss is unavoidable, and the risk of a major loss cannot be eliminated.Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including:  errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by associates or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, information technology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, malware, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make systems more robust may make them less adaptable, and vice-versa. Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challenges as we strive to maintain client service and compliance at high quality and low cost. A serious information technology security (cybersecurity) breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damage can occur due to outright theft or extortion of our funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on clients, or adverse publicity associated with a breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be associates, clients, and certain vendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentially very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree, and our systems must comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and client protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our associates to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we educate our clients as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.The operational functions we outsource to third parties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to obtain an alternate vendor quickly. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks may become more difficult. The operational functions of business counterparties may experience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in recent years a number of major U.S. consumer-oriented firms experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other data of millions of clients. These incursions affected cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Although our systems are not breached in third-party incursions, these events can increase account fraud and can cause us to reissue a significant number of account cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our clients. Our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations. Possible points of incursion or disruption not within our control include retailers, utilities, insurers, health care service  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  302020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsproviders, internet service and electronic mail providers, social media portals, distant-server (“cloud”) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.Failure to build and maintain, or outsource, the necessary operational infrastructure, failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to clients, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 91 of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7).The delivery of financial services to clients and others increasingly depends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risks discussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untested technologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement.Competition for talent is substantial and increasing. Moreover, revenue growth in some business lines increasingly depends upon top talent. In recent years the cost to us of hiring and retaining top revenue-producing talent has increased, and that trend is likely to continue. The primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are:  salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively.Incentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverse effects. Incentive programs are difficult to design well, and even if well-designed often they must be updated to address changes in our business. A poorly designed incentive program—where goals are too difficult, too easy, or not well related to desired outcomes—could provide little useful motivation to key associates, could increase turnover, and could impact client retention. Moreover, even where those pitfalls are avoided, incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences. For example, a program focused entirely on revenue production, without proper controls, may result in costs growing faster than revenues.Risk from Economic Downturns and ChangesGenerally, in an economic downturn, our realized credit losses increase, demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and realized credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for clients and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in employment rates, interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin, and lower fees from transactions and services. Those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends.Risks Associated with Monetary EventsThe Federal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve. These strategies have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business and on many of our clients. In response to the recession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives designed to lower rates and make credit easier to obtain. The Federal Reserve changed course in 2015, raising rates several times through 2018. The last raise in 2018 was accompanied by a substantial and broad stock market decline. In 2019 the Federal Reserve began to lower rates. In 2020, in response to economic disruption associated with the COVID-19 pandemic,  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  312020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsthe Federal Reserve quickly reduced short-term rates to extremely low levels and acted to influence the markets to reduce long-term rates as well. For 2021, the Federal Reserve has indicated that future actions will depend upon changes in economic data.Federal Reserve strategies can, and often are intended to, affect the domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve often are most pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things, easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economic activity, while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply, and restrain economic activity. Many external factors may interfere with the effects of these plans or cause them to be changed, sometimes quickly. Such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significant international monetary policies and events. Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict. Risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item 1A under the caption Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks beginning on page 40.We may be adversely affected by economic and political situations outside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our clients, are linked significantly to economic and market conditions outside the U.S., especially in North and Central America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in South America. Although we have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or non-US sovereign debt, in the future major adverse events outside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impact include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapse of governments, alliances, or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following:  an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailability of borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our clients; impacts upon the U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to major financial disruptions.Risks Related to Businesses We May ExitWe may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or wind-down of businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include:•our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;•our ability to identify and implement key client, personnel, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses; •our ability to mitigate the loss of any pretax income that the exited business produced;•our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and•our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss.Reputation RisksOur ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain clients, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  322020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsprocesses for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management.Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new clients and retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented associates, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, also may result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.Political and social fragmentation in the U.S., combined with access to social media platforms, can increase reputation risk in ways that might not be easily avoided by traditional means. The predominant culture within the banking industry remains traditional: in order to preserve their business reputations, banks generally prefer to avoid direct, public involvement in political or social controversy. Increasingly, though, certain groups—having highly specific political or social agendas and with the ability to communicate their views effectively using social media platforms—have made it more difficult to maintain a traditional approach. One group, for example, may publicly criticize a bank for having, as a client, a business which “exploits” persons of limited financial means, while another group may criticize a bank for failing to have, as a client, the same business which “serves” such persons in neighborhoods that many businesses avoid. As another example, a group may demand that a bank cease doing business with a specific business client based on the client’s industry or a specific business practice because that industry or practice, though legal, is objectionable to that group. While the potential for such demands has always existed, special interest groups today are more able and willing to publicize their criticisms, and some are willing to use factual exaggerations and inflammatory language in stating their views to the public. Those criticisms, in turn, ultimately may be acted upon by legislators or regulators.Credit RisksWe face the risk that our clients may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit charge-offs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary substantially over time. In the last pre-COVID credit cycle, net charge-offs were $132 million in 2007, and increased to $573 million and $832 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline, reaching $13 million by 2017 and remaining historically very low through 2019. In 2020, however, net charge-offs rose to $120 million, driven strongly by the COVID-induced recession starting in March. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan clients and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including real estate, among other things. We further manage credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, by following per-relationship lending limits, and by recording and managing an allowance for loan and lease losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty.We record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption Accounting & Tax Risks beginning on page 44, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to be more volatile, or to be recognized on an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. In fact, as mentioned there, starting in 2020, such an accounting change was made and, when the COVID recession occurred starting in March, loan loss recognition was significantly accelerated. Moreover, the SEC or PCAOB could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the Federal Reserve or other banking regulators. A significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could be misguided or otherwise affected with substantial adverse consequences to us.  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  332020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of ContentsThe recent low-interest rate environment has elevated the traditional challenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income or yield. This challenge applies not only to credit risk in lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding investments.When interest rates eventually rise, default risk likely also will rise. As borrowers’ obligations to pay interest increase, financial weaknesses generally become more evident. Initially this results in lower consumer credit scores and lower commercial loan grading, and later results in higher default rates.Realized credit losses tend to increase and decrease in a cyclical manner, although the duration and timing of any given credit cycle is impossible to predict accurately. Through 2019 we and other U.S. banks experienced an extended period of very low credit losses. The credit cycle was disrupted by COVID-19. Our expectation for losses in 2020 rose sharply with the COVID-19 pandemic and its recession, though in many cases actual losses have significantly lagged. Although economic impact may subside with the distribution of vaccines in 2021, there is significant risk that loan provisioning and eventual loss could be elevated for some time. In any case, we do not know what the new “normal” loan loss levels will be once the impacts of the pandemic have fully ended, or what long-term impact the pandemic will have on the credit cycle. It is extremely difficult for banks, and for investors, to know when an uptick in credit loss is merely idiosyncratic or instead portends a major credit cycle change.Regulatory positions issued during the COVID-19 pandemic may mask the true extent of credit deterioration in certain groups of loans. For borrowers who qualify, loan payment deferrals and other events that normally would trigger default status are not treated as defaults by lenders or the credit bureaus. Temporarily, these positions may obscure credit quality deterioration in those loans. The composition of our loans inherently increases our sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2020, approximately 57% of total loans and leases consisted of the commercial, financial, and industrial (C&I) portfolio, while approximately 20% consisted of the consumer real estate portfolio. The largest component of the C&I portfolio at year end was loans to mortgage companies, a component which represented about 16% of the C&I portfolio at that time. The second largest component was loans to finance and insurance companies. As a result, approximately 26% of the C&I portfolio was sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financial services industry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in real estate and other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions, than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industry could dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio.The consumer real estate portfolio contains a number of concentrations which affect credit risk assessment of the portfolio.•Product concentration. The consumer real estate portfolio consists primarily of consumer installment loans, and much of the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit. •Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 14% of the consumer real estate portfolio consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis. •Geographic concentration. At year end, about 66% of the consumer real estate portfolio related to clients in three states: Florida, Tennessee, and Louisiana. The consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumer clients and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significant life events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer category and our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types.Volatility in the oil and gas industry can impact us. At year-end, approximately 3% of our total loans were directly related to the oil and gas industry. In addition to general credit and other risks mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, these businesses and their related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to that industry. Key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. The shifting balance between demand and supply is expressed most simply in prices. Significant oil-price volatility, such as that experienced in 2020, can and often does impact our overall business in this industry by increasing provisioning and charge-offs, and by reducing demand for loans. Another set of risks specific to that industry relate to environmental concerns, including the risks of increased regulation or other governmental intervention, and the risks of adverse changes in consumption habits or public perceptions generally.  Additional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the caption  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  342020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of ContentsAsset Quality beginning on page 70 of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7).Service RisksWe provide a wide range of services to clients, and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we provided them in a manner that harmed the client or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Our services include lending, loan servicing, fiduciary, custodial, depositary, funds management, insurance, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captions Operational Risk Management and Compliance Risk Management, beginning on pages 91 and 92, respectively, of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7).Risks Related to COVID-19 PandemicThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to periods of significant volatility in financial, commodities (including oil and gas) and other markets, has adversely affected our ability to conduct normal business, has adversely affected our clients, and is likely to harm our businesses and future results of operations.In late 2019, a coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in China, which quickly spread to most countries in the world. Starting in late February 2020, financial market volatility increased dramatically based on concerns that COVID-19, and the steps being undertaken in many countries to mitigate its spread, would significantly disrupt economic activity.In March 2020, financial market volatility increased further, with several one-day stock market swings that resulted in significant market declines. Additionally, in March: market pricing deteriorated in virtually all sectors and asset classes except U.S. Treasury securities; the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic; the U.S. President declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a national emergency, allowing several federal disaster programs to be accessed by states and cities; many states and cities in the U.S. declared health emergencies, lockdowns, travel restrictions, and quarantines, prohibiting gatherings of more than a small number of people and ordering or urging most businesses and workplaces to close or operate on a very restricted basis; the Federal Reserve lowered short-term interest rates and started a “quantitative easing” program intended to lower longer-term interest rates and foster access to credit; the effective yields of 10-year and 30-year U.S. Treasury securities achieved record low rates; and the U.S. Congress enacted relief legislation. Government actions in the U.S. have included loan programs administered by banks and other private-sector lenders, liquidity programs administered by the U.S. Treasury, and favorable accounting and regulatory treatment (for lenders) of certain loan payment deferrals.During the summer of 2020, in the U.S. infection and hospitalization rates declined, and government restrictions on businesses and the public eased in many locales. Late in the year, a new strain of the virus was identified, while infection and hospitalization rates increased sharply, prompting many governments to re-impose earlier restrictions going into 2021.In 2020 and early 2021, the economic effects of these and related actions and events in the U.S. included: large numbers of partial or full business closures; large numbers of people were furloughed or laid off; large increases in unemployment; large numbers of workers worked from home; and large numbers of consumers were unwilling to undertake significant discretionary spending. In addition, worldwide demand for oil fell, resulting in significant drops in oil prices and in the values of oil-related assets. We are not able to predict the impact of these still-changing circumstances on our businesses in 2021, although we expect the overall impact to be less in 2021 than in 2020. The full extent of impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and other events beyond our control will depend on uncertain future developments, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of new COVID strains, the effectiveness of vaccines on existing and new strains, and further actions governments may take to slow the spread of the virus, treat the ill, distribute the vaccines, and assist affected businesses. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in modest operational disruptions for us. Clients’ physical access to banking centers has been restricted off and on in many markets, and many non-client-facing associates have worked largely on a remote basis. More significant disruptions in the future could  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  352020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsadversely impact our businesses, financial condition, and results of operations. Our post-merger integration efforts may be delayed and adversely affected by the pandemic, and could become more costly. Vaccines offer the hope of substantially ending the economic disruption caused by COVID-19 during 2021; however, the lead times needed for effective distribution to the U.S population, and for effective immunity to develop in those people who are inoculated, mean that economic disruption is likely to continue for a significant period this year. Vaccines, reportedly with unusually high effectiveness rates, have been developed and approved for the public in the U.S., and, early in 2021, are being distributed by the various states. Distribution in the U.S. is hampered by special equipment needed to transport and store the vaccine material at very cold temperatures. Other vaccines have been developed and are expected to be approved in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2021. The vaccines reportedly are not fully effective for five or six weeks after first being administered. Also, a few political and other prominent leaders at first publicly signaled doubt regarding the safety or efficacy of the vaccines. These and other similar factors make it difficult to predict when economic restrictions will substantially relax or end, or when a critical percentage of the population no longer will fear the pandemic. Changes in interest rates due to Federal Reserve actions and market forces, mentioned above, negatively impacted our net interest margin (a measure of the average profit margin applicable to lending). Interest rates should begin to normalize when economic conditions improve significantly, but the timing and degree of normalization cannot be predicted. Also, “spreads” (the difference between U.S. Treasury borrowing rates and private sector borrowing rates) widened in 2020. For post-COVID loans, wider spreads should help mitigate net interest margin compression. However, pre-COVID spreads are fixed by the loan contracts based on pre-COVID pricing.Our clients and vendors have been adversely impacted by governmental and societal responses to COVID-19. Those impacts on clients reduced noninterest income, created downward loan migration (a reduction in loan-grading), and increased provision for credit losses.Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal RisksThe regulatory environment continues to be challenging. We operate in a heavily regulated industry. Our regulatory burdens, including both operating restrictions and ongoing compliance costs, are substantial. We are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 18, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. The following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to regulatory matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do not describe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change.We and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios. U.S. capital standards are discussed in Item 1 of this report, in tabular and narrative form, under the caption Capital Adequacy starting on page 20. Pressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a changing economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders. Such actions could include:  reduction or elimination of dividends; the issuance of common or preferred stock, or securities convertible into stock; or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of common or preferred stock.Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions Capital Adequacy and Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) in Item 1 of this report beginning on  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  362020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentspages 20 and 21, respectively; under the captions Capital, Capital Risk Management and Adequacy, and Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends beginning on pages 67, 91, and 97, respectively, of our 2020 MD&A (Item); and under the caption Regulatory Capital in Note 13—Regulatory Capital and Restrictions, beginning on page 173 of our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8).Legal disputes are an unavoidable part of business, and the outcome of pending or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty. We face the risk of litigation from clients, associates, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty.Typically, we are unable to estimate our loss exposure from legal claims until relatively late in the litigation process, which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigation unpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next. For most of our pending legal matters we have established either no accrual (reserve) or no significant reserve. Financial accounting guidance requires that litigation loss be both estimable and probable before a reserve may be established (recorded as a liability on our balance sheet). Under that guidance, reserves typically are not established for most litigation matters until after preliminary motions to dismiss or to narrow the case are resolved, after discovery is substantially in process, and (in many cases) after preliminary overtures regarding settlement have occurred. Potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserve is established. Moreover, many cases experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long period followed by a brief period of rapid development. Lastly, although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us, for the others our loss typically is recognized either all at once (near the time of resolution) or very unevenly over the life of the case. Additional information concerning litigation risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the caption Pre-2009 Mortgage Business Risks beginning on page 44 of this report; under the captions Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations, Repurchase Accrual Methodology, Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends, and Contingent Liabilities beginning on pages 95, 95, 97, and 101, respectively, of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7); and under the caption Contingencies in Note 17—Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 181 of our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8).Political dysfunction and volatility within the federal government, both at the regulatory and Congressional level, creates significant potential for major and abrupt shifts in federal policy regarding bank regulation, taxes, and the economy, any of which could have significant impacts on our business and financial performance. Moreover, political conflict within and among branches of government, and within and among government agencies, can rise to a level where day-to-day functions could be interrupted or impaired.Data privacy is becoming a major political concern.  The laws governing it are new, and are likely to evolve and expand. Many non-regulated, non-banking companies have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people, and have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly. This situation has prompted governmental responses. Two prominent responses are the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Neither is a banking industry regulation, but both apply to banks in relation to certain clients. Further general regulation to protect data privacy appears likely, and banking industry regulations might be enlarged as well.Public expectations concerning corporate controls on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs in the future without a corresponding increase in revenue, could curtail some aspects of our business, or both. At present, environmental regulations do not require us to monitor the direct or indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with building, operating, or maintaining our physical facilities, nor are we taxed or fined in relation to those emissions, because such gases generally are not considered to be pollutants under federal law. Changing expectations could pressure us to physically measure, monitor, and curtail direct emissions and to estimate indirect emissions or impacts, and eventually could result in legal requirements to take those actions or to pay for measured or estimated emissions. Whether or not legally required, any such actions that we take would increase our operating costs. In addition, such expectations could pressure us to discontinue business relationships with certain clients, or groups of clients, that have suboptimal reputations for emissions.Although currently no proposal has been published, future regulations could discourage us from lending to clients in certain industries judged to be environmentally high-risk, even if those elevated risk factors have a long time  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  372020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentshorizon or are speculative for other reasons. Changes of that sort could curtail our ability to pursue profitable business opportunities.Risks of Expense ControlOur ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term success, but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change—whether by acquisition, expansion, or contraction—additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recent years we have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking and right-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usually entail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs, and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future. We have also focused on the economic profit generated by our business activities and prospects rather than emphasizing revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attempts to relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returns on capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The process is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment and utilization of resources. Economic profit analysis involves significant judgment regarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitability over the long run.Despite our efforts, our costs could rise due to adverse structural changes or market shifts. For example, the overall cost of our health insurance benefit is highly dependent upon regulatory factors and market forces beyond our control.Geographic RisksWe are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions. To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact the south-eastern and south-central U.S. states where we do most of our traditional banking business. If those regions of the U.S. were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader or different regional footprint. Examples of these kinds of risks include: earthquakes in Memphis; hurricanes in Florida, Louisiana, the Carolina coasts, or the Texas coast; a major change in health insurance laws impacting the many healthcare companies in middle Tennessee; and automotive industry plant closures.We have international assets, mainly in the form of loans and letters of credit.  Holding non-U.S. assets creates a number of risks:  the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities; and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our ability to manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in legal, cultural, and other expectations applicable to clients, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed. FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  382020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of ContentsInsuranceOur property and casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequate to cover the risks that we face, and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by insurers. We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the risk of default as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation.A portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified.We own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assets on our books. Some of those policies are “general account” and others are “separate account.” The general account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separate account policies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularly for the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantly limited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination.When we self-insure certain exposures, our estimates of future expenditures may be inadequate for the actual expenditures that occur. For example, we self-insure our associate health-insurance benefit program. We estimate future expenditures and establish accruals (reserves) based on the estimates. If actual expenditures were to exceed our estimates in a future period, our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased.Liquidity and Funding RisksLiquidity is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidity, or an increase in the cost of liquidity, may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2020 were met principally by deposits, by financing from other financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets. Deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds and by far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. If interest rates fall, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly if a tipping point is reached, as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could pressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink our net interest margin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly. In the past two years deposit rates have fallen, to remarkably low levels. Although stock market values have climbed (broadly speaking), deposit levels also have climbed. While difficult to explain definitively, it is possible that while a sizable portion of available capital holders are comfortable with risk, another sizable portion are highly risk-averse in light of the severe volatility experienced by the stock markets in 2018, 2019, and 2020.The market among banks for deposits may be impacted by current capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Institutions with less than $100 billion of assets are not required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. At or above $100 billion, the requirement increases with size and certain activities. The largest banks, which must maintain the highest minimum ratio, may be incented to compete for core deposits vigorously. Although mid-sized banks, like ours, are only lightly impacted by this rule, if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  392020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentswe could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs.We also depend upon financing from private institutional or other investors by means of the capital markets. In spring 2020, before we closed the IBKC merger, we issued and sold $150 million of preferred stock, along with a total of $1.3 billion of senior and subordinated notes. Presently we believe we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may become unavailable to us for reasons beyond our control.A number of more general factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may remain or become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control. Changes associated with LIBOR also may impact our funding ability; see Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks beginning on page 40.Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit.Credit RatingsOur credit ratings directly affect the availability and cost of our unsecured funding. Our holding company (the Corporation) and our Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. At December 31, 2020, both rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation and of the Bank as investment grade. The ratings outlook was stable from Moody’s and from Fitch for both the Corporation and the Bank. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Reductions in our credit ratings could result in counterparties reducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restricting the business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold.Reductions in our credit ratings could allow some counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. Under our margin agreements, we are required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties. At this time, only one counterparty has a defined trigger and collateral threshold which references the lower of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC or Moody’s ratings. If a credit rating downgrade had occurred as of December 31, 2020, the maximum specified additional collateral we would have been required to post would have been less than $1 million. Contracts with other counterparties do not have defined thresholds and FHN could be asked to post collateral of an undetermined amount based on changes in credit ratings and derivative value.Interest Rate and Yield Curve RisksWe are subject to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. A considerable portion of our  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  402020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsfunding comes from short-term and demand deposits, while a sizeable portion of our lending and investing is in medium-term and long-term instruments. Changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. In addition, our fixed income business tends to perform better when rates decline or markets are volatile, which tends to partially offset net interest margin compression.A flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interest margin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses. The yield curve is a reflection of interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The yield curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates and long-term rates are nearly the same; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve is usually upward sloping (higher rates for longer terms). However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted (downward sloping), which has happened several times in the past few years. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business. We appear to be at the extreme “easing” end of the spectrum in terms of interest rate policy, with no clear timeline when “tightening” might resume; the uncertainties of the magnitude and timing of future rate actions could adversely affect us. The Federal Reserve eased substantially in 2020 in response to the COVID pandemic. In addition, the Fed has provided other stimulus through open-market purchases of various bond asset classes and the introduction of several liquidity facilities. As a result, rates cannot move much lower without becoming negative. The Federal Reserve seems determined to begin normalizing rates only in response to significant and sustained economic improvement, maximum employment, and inflation consistent with longer-run goals. We cannot predict when those conditions will exist.  Meanwhile, we believe that the current low-rate, low-margin environment will continue for some time. See Risks Associated with Monetary Events beginning on page 31 of this report for additional information.Market-indexed deposit products are very sensitive to changes in short-term rates, and our use of them increases our exposure to such changes. If market rates rise, an increase in those deposit rates may be necessary before we are able to effect similar increases in loan rates.Expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed income business. This risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.The expected discontinuance of LIBOR as a viable benchmark rate may adversely affect our business and our operating results. In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In late 2020 the ICE Benchmark Administration (“Administrator” for LIBOR) posted a consultation on definitive end dates for the publication of USD LIBOR in which certain USD LIBOR tenors may continue to be published in some form after 2021. The consultation feedback and response from the Administrator as well as domestic and foreign regulators is pending. As a result, it is unclear if any LIBOR tenors will continue to be published after 2021.At this time, it is uncertain as to which reference rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. The uncertainty poses both idiosyncratic and system wide risk. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) is a group of private-market participants convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Fed to help ensure a successful transition from USD LIBOR to a more robust reference rate. The ARRC has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as its preferred alternative. SOFR is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York but is not directly comparable to LIBOR and cannot easily or simply be substituted for it in outstanding instruments. Key differences between the two are: SOFR is based on secured lending, LIBOR is not; and SOFR historically has been published only as an overnight rate, while LIBOR is published in many short-term forward looking maturity tenors.Since SOFR is based on secured lending, it is generally considered a “risk-free rate” whereas LIBOR includes an implicit credit spread. There is no clear solution or market-accepted practice to fully address this first difference of SOFR from LIBOR.In response to the second difference, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York has begun to publish compounded average SOFR rates covering prior 30-, 90-, and 180-day periods. It remains unclear how the market will use this data. Another potential alternative, the American Interbank Offered Rate (“AMBERIBOR”) Index which is  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  412020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsproduced by the American Financial Exchange, has gained some  market acceptance, but it has been limited. It remains unclear if AMERIBOR will become widely accepted in future. Other new indices, spread adjustments, and methodologies are in development by various providers. SOFR may become the primary reference rate replacement for certain financial products such as derivatives and adjustable rate mortgages. However, there is no clear market leader in other products. Further, it is impossible to predict the effect on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans of adopting SOFR or another alternative. As a lender, an owner of securities, or a contractual counterparty, our primary exposures to LIBOR are in variable-rate loans and in hedging transactions. We are not able to determine the impact on us that LIBOR discontinuance will have. The simplicity and long history of using LIBOR, the lack of a definite alternative, and the possibility that different alternatives ultimately may be used in different circumstances, means that LIBOR continues to be used in many new instruments. A few instruments issued by us, including certain series of preferred stock and certain trust preferred obligations, have floating rate terms based on LIBOR, or have fixed rates that later will convert to floating rate terms based on LIBOR.  As mentioned above, it is not known how long LIBOR will continue in a workable form. We have risk that an adverse outcome of the LIBOR transition after the expected discontinuation could increase our interest, dividend, and other costs relative to those instruments. We may not be able to refinance those instruments on terms that reduce those costs to the level we would have expected if LIBOR were to continue indefinitely, unchanged. Further, some of these contracts are governed under New York State law where pending legislation would directly impact how the post-LIBOR rate is set. Additional legislative actions, both existing and those that may come in the future, at the Federal and state level may impact these and other facilities in an undetermined manner.The transition from LIBOR may impact our ability to use hedge accounting, which could impact us as a lender, a securities owner, a counterparty, or an issuer. However, accounting and tax agencies have issued preliminary guidance that may ease the transition. In late 2020, the International Swap Dealers Association (“ISDA”) published the LIBOR Fallbacks Protocol as a proposed standardized methodology for LIBOR transition for derivatives contracts. The central clearing counterparties (“CCPs”) for derivatives, however, are currently considering an alternative methodology for LIBOR transition for cleared derivatives contracts which differs from the ISDA protocol in various respects. While the final outcome of this matter is uncertain at this time, the alternative methodology being considered by the CCPs, if finalized, may result in operational and accounting implications for our LIBOR transition process for derivatives contracts.Asset Inventories and Market RisksThe trading securities inventories and loans held for sale in our fixed income business are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securities inventory and loan positions for purposes of distribution to clients, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributable principally to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with those assets. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities and loans through certain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. Average fixed income trading securities (long positions) were $1.4 billion for 2020, $1.4 billion for 2019, and $1.6 billion for 2018. Average fixed income trading liabilities (short positions) were $457 million, $503 million, and $683 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. Average loans held for sale in our fixed income business were $554 million, $485 million, and $563 million for 2020, 2019, and 2018. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginning on page 88 of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7).Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for clients. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.Significant changes to the securities market’s performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  422020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of ContentsAn example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims, the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims, and estimates of plan asset values. Our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors. Accordingly, our obligations diminish if the plan’s investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance, and can grow if those investments perform poorly or if expectations worsen. A rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impact the values of fixed income assets held in the plan, but would also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of future benefit payments. Similarly, our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarial inputs.  We manage the risk of rate changes by investing plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities aligned with the expected timing of payouts. Because there are no new participants, the actuarial-input risk should slowly diminish over time.Changes in our funding obligation generally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Our obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating associate population and changes to the plan itself. Although we have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable. Our hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequately hedge our risks, and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. For example: our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on a portion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; we hedge the risk of interest rate movements related to the gap between the time we originate mortgage loans and the time we sell them; and we use derivatives, including swaps, swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Generally, in the last example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans.Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings.Mortgage Business RisksWe have contractual risks from our mortgage business. Our traditional mortgage business primarily consists of helping clients obtain home mortgages which we sell, rather than hold, or which qualify for a government-guarantee program. The mortgage terms conform to the requirements of the mortgage buyers or government agencies, and we make representations to those buyers or agencies concerning conformity of each mortgage at origination. Although the buyers and agencies generally take the risk that a mortgage defaults, we retain the risk that our representations were materially incorrect. In such a case, the buyer or agency generally has the power to force us to take the loan back for its face value, or to make the buyer or agency whole for loss.Some government mortgage programs could impose penalties on us for misrepresentations at the time of obtaining benefits under the program. Penalties can be severe, up to three times the agency’s loss. As a result, mortgage origination processes need to emphasize being thorough and correct, in compliance with all agency standards. Those processes tend to slow the mortgage lending process for clients, and increase the complexity of the paperwork.The mortgage servicing business creates regulatory risks.  Servicing requires continual interaction with consumer clients. Federal, state, and sometimes local laws regulate when and how we interact with consumer clients. The requirements can be complex and difficult for us to administer, especially if a client is having difficulty with the mortgage loan. Failure to follow the applicable rules can result in significant penalties or other loss for us.The mortgage servicing business creates financial reporting valuation risks. Our contractual right to service a loan generally is viewed as an asset for financial reporting purposes. Servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value, which affects the gains recognized upon sale of the related loans.  Thereafter, servicing rights are amortized and  reviewed for impairment. The valuations of servicing rights are dependent upon a number of inputs and assumptions that require management judgment. If our servicing rights become large in relation to our overall size, especially in volatile times, the impact of  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  432020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsvaluation changes can be significant and difficult to predict.Pre-2009 Mortgage Business RisksWe have risks from the mortgage-related businesses we exited in 2008, including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, and claims of non-compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements. In 2008 we exited our national mortgage and related lending businesses. We retain the risk of liability to clients and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating those businesses. Additional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations beginning on page 95, and Contingent Liabilities beginning on page 101 of our 2020 MD&A (Item 7); and under the captions Exposures from pre-2009 Mortgage Business and Mortgage Loan Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability, both beginning on page 182 within Note 17—Contingencies and Other Disclosures, of our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8).Accounting & Tax RisksThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements.  The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for credit losses. However, other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length, for example the valuation (or impairment) of our deferred tax assets. Estimates are made at specific points in time. As actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, often we are unable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process.A significant merger or acquisition requires us to make many estimates, including the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities. With larger transactions, fair value and other estimations can take up to four quarters to finalize. These estimates, and their revisions, can have a substantial effect on the presentation of our financial condition and operating results after the transaction closes. In addition, the excess of the value “paid” by us in the merger or acquisition over the fair value of the assets acquired, net of liabilities assumed, is recorded as goodwill. Goodwill is subject to periodic impairment assessment, a process that can result in impairment expense which may be significant and sudden.Changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry. One such accounting change, ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” substantially revised the measurement and recognition of credit losses for certain assets, including most loans, in a manner that has substantially changed when and how we recognize loan loss. ASU 2016-13 was effective for us on January 1, 2020. Under ASU 2016-13, when we make or acquire a new loan, we are required to recognize immediately the “current expected credit loss,” or “CECL,” of that loan. We will also re-evaluate CECL each quarter that the loan is outstanding. CECL is the difference between our cost and the net amount we expect to collect over the life of the loan using certain estimation methods that incorporate macroeconomic forecasts and our experience with other, similar loans. In contrast, the pre-2020 accounting standard delayed recognition until loss was “probable” (very likely). We adopted ASU 2016-13 and CECL accounting starting in 2020, with the impact on regulatory capital having a phase-in period. Starting in 2020, recognition of estimated credit loss was significantly accelerated compared to pre-CECL practice, which was aggravated by the actual and projected effects of the pandemic. Additional information concerning ASU 2016-13 and its effects upon us appears in Note 1—Summary of  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  442020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of ContentsSignificant Accounting Policies within our 2020 Financial Statements (Item 8), under the heading Summary of Accounting Changes beginning on page 135, and in Item 1 under the caption CECL Accounting and COVID-19 beginning on page 12, all of which information is incorporated into this Item 1A by reference.In comparison with former (pre-2020) standards, CECL accounting likely will continue to: result in a significant increase in our provision for credit losses (expense) and allowance (reserve) during any period of loan growth, including organic growth and growth created by acquisition or merger; through the increased provision, adversely impact our earnings and, correspondingly, our regulatory capital levels; and enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year, especially during times when the economy is in transition or experiencing significant volatility. Moreover, once fully phased in, CECL creates an incentive for banks to reduce new lending in the “down” part of the economic cycle in order to reduce loss recognition and conserve regulatory capital. That perverse incentive could, nationwide, prolong a down cycle in the economy and delay a recovery. Changes in regulatory rules can create significant accounting impacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry, we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accounting standards. Changes in those standards can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financial reporting.Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented. Internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures (“controls and procedures”) must be effective in order to provide assurance that financial reports are materially accurate. A failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Stock-Holding and Governance RisksThe principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock, as well as service our debt, is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank may become unable to pay dividends to us without regulatory approval. First Horizon Corporation primarily depends upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our common and preferred stockholders, and to service our outstanding debt. Regulatory constraints might constrain or prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to us in 2021 without regulatory approval. Applying the applicable regulatory rules, at January 1, 2021, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank's common or preferred stock of approximately $897 million without obtaining regulatory approval. Also, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank. Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may need to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable for dividends.Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company’s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Our stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders. We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that would be dilutive to stockholders in terms of voting power and share-of-ownership, and could be dilutive financially or economically. The IBKC merger, for example, resulted in a significant increase in our outstanding shares. We issued to former IBKC shareholders common  FIRST HORIZON CORPORATION  452020 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORTTable of Contentsshares representing about 44% of our post-closing outstanding shares. Our issuance of preferred stock raises regulatory capital without issuing common shares, but creates or expands our general obligation to pay all preferred dividends ahead of any common dividends. Currently we have six series of preferred stock outstanding, one issued by the Bank and five by First Horizon Corporation. Subject to capital needs and market conditions, additional series may be issued in the future.Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders. In addition, federal banking laws prohibit non-financial-industry companies from owning a bank, and require regulatory approval of any change in control of a bank.Certain legal rights of holders of our common stock and of depositary shares related to Series B, C, and D of our preferred stock to pursue claims against us or the depositary, as applicable, are limited by our bylaws and by the terms of the deposit agreements. Our bylaws provide that, unless we consent in writing to an alternative forum, a state or federal court located within Shelby County in the State of Tennessee will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought in our right or name, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other associate of ours to us or our shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer or other associate of ours arising pursuant to any provision of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act, of our charter or bylaws or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us or any director, officer or other associate of ours that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. In addition, each deposit agreement between us and the depositary, which govern the rights of the depositary shares related to our Series B, C, and D preferred stock, provide that any action or proceeding arising out of or relating in any way to the deposit agreement may only be brought in a state court located in the State of New York or in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The foregoing exclusive forum clauses may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against us or our directors, officers or other associates, or against the depositary, as applicable. Exclusive forum clauses may also lead to increased costs to bring a claim, or may limit the ability of holders of our common stock or depositary shares to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable. In addition, the exclusive forum clauses in our bylaws and deposit agreement could apply to actions or proceedings that may arise under the federal securities laws, depending on the nature of the claim alleged. To the extent these exclusive forum clauses restrict the courts in which holders of our common stock or depositary shares may bring claims arising under the federal securities laws, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce such provisions. These exclusive forum provisions do not mean that holders of our common stock or depositary shares have waived our obligations to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder"

Our primary areas of competition for customers include: consumer and commercial deposits, commercial loans, consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, financial planning and wealth management, fixed income products and services, and other consumer and commercial financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies (traditional and otherwise) that serve the markets which we serve. The emergence of non-traditional, disruptive service providers (see “Industry Disruption” beginning on page 22) has intensified the competitive environment. Some competitors are traditional banks, subject to the same regulatory framework as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation. Long-standing examples of less-regulated activity include check-cashing and  independent ATM services. A recent example of unregulated activity is so-called “peer-to-peer” lending, where investors provide debt financing and/or capital directly to borrowers. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to “Competition” within Item 1 beginning on page 16 of this report.We compete for talent. Our most significant competitors for customers also are our most significant competitors for top talent. See “Operational Risks” beginning on page 23 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.We compete to raise capital in the equity and debt markets. See “Liquidity and Funding Risks” beginning on page 32 of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk.Traditional Strategic and Macro RisksWe may be unable to successfully implement our strategy to grow our commercial and consumer banking businesses and our fixed income business. Although our current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions change, at present our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking and fixed income businesses. Growth is expected to be coordinated  with a focus on strong and stable returns on capital. In the past four years we have mixed organic growth with tactical acquisitions and a strategic acquisition (Capital Bank). In 2020 we expect to close a tactical acquisition of 30 bank branches and a strategic merger-of-equals with IBKC.FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   21Organically, we have enhanced our market share in our traditional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into other southeast U.S. markets with similar characteristics, and expanded with commercial lending and private client banking in the Houston, Texas market. We have made similar moves in our fixed income business. In the future, we expect to continue to nurture profitable organic growth, especially after we combine and integrate the 30 branches and IBKC with our existing banking centers and operations. We may pursue other acquisitions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves. Failure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful organic growth would adversely affect our business and earnings. We believe that the successful execution of organic growth depends upon a number of key elements, including:•our ability to attract and retain customers in our banking market areas;•our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities;•in our fixed income business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers; •our ability to maintain a high level of customer service while optimizing our physical banking center count due to changing customer demand, all while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information processing, technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; •our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-funded acquisitions; and•our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex, burdensome, and evolving regulatory environment.We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change.Failure to achieve one or more key elements needed for successful business acquisitions would adversely affect our business and earnings. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions (including the two currently pending), we face various additional risks, including:•our ability to realize planned or hoped-for strategic and tactical objectives, including operating efficiencies  and revenue synergies, within a reasonable time period after closing the transaction; •our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;•our ability to properly evaluate loss inherent in the target business’ loan portfolios;•our ability to integrate the acquired business’ operations, customers, and properties quickly and cost-effectively;•our ability to manage cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions, which can be an often-overlooked and often-critical failure point in mergers; •our ability to combine the franchise values of the two companies without significant loss from re-branding and other similar changes; and•our ability to retain core customers and key employees.In fourth quarter 2019, we re-branded our businesses and began re-branding our banking centers. That effort makes us somewhat more sensitive, for a time, to the risk that customers will experience confusion or “branding fatigue,” which may be exacerbated in 2020 when we complete the re-branding of our banking centers, convert the 30 acquired branches, and begin to convert IBKC businesses and locations to the First Horizon brands. Fortunately, some of the 30 branches, and most of IBKC’s branches, do not overlap with our banking center markets, which should help mitigate ill effects.A type of strategic acquisition-a so-called “merger of equals” where the company we nominally acquire has similar size, operating contribution, or value-presents unique opportunities but also unique risks. Those special risks, which are present in the IBKC transaction, include:•the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies efficiently in a reasonable amount of time; and•the potential for a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before substantial economies of scale can be realized or substantial revenue synergies can be developed effectively.FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   22Industry DisruptionThrough technological innovations and changes in customer habits, the manner in which customers use financial services continues to change at a rapid pace. We provide a large number of services remotely (online and mobile), and physical banking center utilization has been in long-term decline throughout the industry for many years. Technology has helped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has weakened traditional geographic and relationship ties, and has allowed disruptors to enter traditional banking areas. Through digital marketing and service platforms, many banks are making customer inroads unrelated to physical presence. This competitive risk is especially pronounced from the largest U.S. banks, and from online-only banks, due in part to the investments they are able to sustain in their digital platforms. Companies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse) and Starbucks (a large chain of cafes) provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible traditionally. The nature of technology-driven disruption to our industry is changing, in some cases seeking to displace traditional financial service providers rather than merely enhance traditional services or their delivery. A number of recent technologies have worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of delivering those services. But some recent innovations may tend to replace traditional banks as financial service providers rather than merely augment those services. For example, companies which claim to offer applications and services based on artificial intelligence are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personal advice, including high-margin services such as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these “robo-advisor” services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent customers and potential customers, as well as persons interested in “self-service” investment management. Other industry changes, such as zero-commission trading offered by certain large firms able to use trading as a loss-leader, may amplify this trend.Similarly, inventions based on blockchain technology eventually may be the foundation for greatly enhancing transactional security throughout the banking industry, but also eventually may greatly reduce the need for banks as financial deposit-keepers and intermediaries. We believe that, over the course of the technology-driven evolution of our industry which is well underway, the “winners” will be those institutions which can know their customers and make those customers feel they are known, even when many customers increasingly do not visit banking centers or have face-to-face live interaction. Two keys to achieving a psychological connection with such customers are (1) data management and analytics, using artificial intelligence processes, which allow an institution to provide a differentiated, personalized experience for the customer at the point of interaction, and (2) seamless integration of real-time customer contact with a human being through voice, chat, or otherwise. A critical factor in successful data analytics, allowing real-time differentiated interaction with customers, is how traditionally uncaptured, unstructured, or siloed data is acquired, managed, and accessed. Some banks are experimenting with different methods of addressing this business need, and more will follow. In addition, external vendors are developing processes to provide solutions. A basic challenge for all these efforts is how to integrate analysis of extremely disparate forms of data and utilize that analysis in each customer contact in a manner which most customers not only accept, but value.Developing workable proprietary solutions to the data analytics challenges ahead of competitors requires substantial investment in information technology systems and innovation. Even with a substantial IT budget, we cannot outspend, or even come close to matching, the largest U.S. banking institutions. Therefore, like most U.S. banks, our strategy must be focused on leveraging products and solutions which are within our means, including those developed by external vendors. Our goal must be to keep pace with industry developments with a focus on improving the customer’s differentiated experience with us by recognizing and responding to customer needs. Technological innovation has tended to reduce barriers to entry based on cost. Put another way, once someone finds a new, better method to accomplish a task in our industry, often others are able to replicate or improve on that method, sometimes quite rapidly. Key risks for us, therefore, are whether we will be able: to catch up to breakthroughs quickly enough to avoid customer attrition; to adopt and enhance breakthroughs frequently enough, and without significant technical failures, to attract customers from competitors; and, if we are able to truly innovate, to press our advantage quickly before competitors adopt it.To thrive as our industry is disrupted, we will need to embrace some of the attitudes of a technology company, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   23and shed some of the attitudes of a traditional bank. This has and will continue to require an evolution in our corporate culture which, in turn, creates implementation risk. In this process it is critical that we not lose sight of how our customers experience working with us and our systems, including those customers who still want traditionally-delivered services, those who seek and embrace the latest innovations, and those who just want services to be convenient, personalized, and understandable.Just as disruptive business changes driven by new technologies and new customer preferences can adversely impact us and our entire industry, similar events can adversely impact our commercial customers.  In time, a major business disruption can cause dominant businesses to fail, and can shrink or even end entire lines of business. An example of this is the business failure of the Blockbuster video distribution chain and most other video distribution stores, and the rise of Netflix. Many other examples of this kind of process are ongoing today in many industries, including publishing, retail sales, news, and the creation as well as distribution of audio and video entertainment. To the extent disruptions impact our customers, we may experience elevated loan losses and loss of ongoing business which we may not be able to recapture with new customers. Operational RisksFraud is a major, and increasing, operational risk for us and all banks. Two traditional areas, deposit fraud (check kiting, wire fraud, etc.) and loan fraud, continue to be major sources of fraud attempts and loss. The methods used to perpetrate and combat fraud continue to evolve as technology changes. Our anti-fraud actions are both preventive (anticipating lines of attack, educating employees and customers, etc.) and responsive (remediating actual attacks). Our regulators require us and all banks to report fraud promptly. Regulators often advise banks of new schemes so that the entire industry can adapt as quickly as possible. However, some level of fraud loss is unavoidable, and the risk of a major loss cannot be eliminated.Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including:  errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, information technology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, malware, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make systems more robust may make them less adaptable, and vice-versa. Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challenges as we strive to maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost.  A serious information technology security (cybersecurity) breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damage can occur due to outright theft or extortion of our funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers, or adverse publicity associated with a breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certain vendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentially very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and external security concerns to a high degree, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and customer protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we educate our customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.The operational functions we outsource to third parties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited ability to obtain an alternate vendor quickly. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks may become more difficult. The operational functions of business counterparties may experience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in recent years several major U.S. retailers, a major electronic mail provider, and a major credit reporting FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   24firm all experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other data of millions of customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Although our systems are not breached in retailer incursions, these events can increase account fraud and can cause us to reissue a significant number of account cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our customers. Our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations. Other possible points of incursion or disruption not within our control include internet service providers, social media portals, distant-server (“cloud”) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers.Failure to build and maintain, or outsource, the necessary operational infrastructure, failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “Operational Risk Management” beginning on page 89 of our 2019 MD&A (Item 7). The delivery of financial services to customers and others increasingly depends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risks discussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untested technologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement.Competition for talent is substantial and increasing. Moreover, revenue growth in some business lines increasingly depends upon top talent. In recent years the cost to us of hiring and retaining top revenue-producing talent has increased, and that trend is likely to continue. The primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are:  salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively.Incentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverse effects. Incentive programs are difficult to design well, and even if well-designed often they must be updated to address changes in our business. A poorly designed incentive program-where goals are too difficult, too easy, or not well related to desired outcomes-could provide little useful motivation to key employees, could increase turnover, and could impact customer retention. Moreover, even where those pitfalls are avoided, incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences. For example, a program focused entirely on revenue production, without proper controls, may result in costs growing faster than revenues.Risk from Economic Downturns and ChangesGenerally, in an economic downturn, our credit losses increase, demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and  services. Such factors include, for example, changes in employment rates, interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin, and lower fees from transactions and services. Those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends.FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   25Risks Associated with Monetary EventsThe Federal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve. These strategies have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our business and on many of our customers. In response to the recession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives designed to lower rates and make credit easier to obtain. The Federal Reserve changed course in 2015, raising rates five times by 2017, in each case by a modest 25 basis points. It then raised rates four times, for a total of 100 basis points, in 2018. The last two raises were followed by substantial volatility in the U.S. stock market, and the last raise was accompanied by a substantial and broad stock market decline. In 2019 the Federal Reserve changed course again, cutting rates a total of 75 basis points. During the first two months of 2020, the Federal Reserve has signaled no clear up or down intentions for rates, indicating that future actions will depend upon changes in economic data.Federal Reserve strategies can, and often are intended to, affect the domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve often are most pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things, easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economic activity, while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply, and restrain economic activity. Many external factors may interfere with the effects of these plans or cause them to be changed, sometimes quickly. Such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significant international monetary  policies and events. Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict. Risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item 1A under the caption “Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks” beginning on page 33.We may be adversely affected by economic and political situations outside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our customers, are linked significantly to economic and market conditions outside the U.S., especially in North America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in Central and South America. Although we have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or non-US sovereign debt, in the future major adverse events outside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impact include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapse of governments, alliances, or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following:  an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailability of borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our customers; impacts upon the U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to major financial disruptions.Risks Related to Businesses We May ExitWe may be unable to successfully implement a disposition or wind-down of businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include:•our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;•our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to  avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses; •our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and•our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cash expenditures or financial loss. FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   26Legacy Mortgage Business RisksWe have risks from the mortgage-related businesses we exited, including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, claims of non-compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements, and the risk of higher default rates on loans made by our former businesses. In 2008 we exited our national mortgage and related lending businesses. However, in our non-strategic segment we still retain as assets a significant amount of loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated across the U.S. We retain the risk of liability to customers and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:•We are contending with, and defending litigation matters associated with, indemnity claims arising out of our former (pre-2009) mortgage origination and sale activities. The outcome of those matters is uncertain; losses in excess of current accruals (reserves) could be material. Although some types of new claims and actions no longer are legally viable due to the passage of time, others could still arise.•We could be subject to claims that servicing-related actions were done improperly, or improperly were not done. Although we may be able to demand indemnity in cases where servicing was performed on our behalf by another institution, there is risk that such an indemnity demand could be refused by the institution or rejected by an appropriate court.Additional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations” beginning on page 93, “Obligations from Pre-2009 Mortgage Businesses” beginning on page 93, “Repurchase Accrual Methodology” beginning on page 93, “Foreclosure Practices” beginning on page 96, and “Contingent Liabilities” beginning on page 99 of our 2019 MD&A (Item 7); and under the captions “Material Matters” and “Exposures from pre-2009 Mortgage Business,” both beginning on page 173, within Note 17-Contingencies and Other Disclosures, of our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8).  We have exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligations and assets which we retained after we generally sold our mortgage businesses in 2008, especially in relation to the subservicing arrangements we made between 2008 and the sale of substantially all our remaining servicing assets completed in 2014. When we sold our origination and servicing businesses in 2008 we retained significant servicing obligations and assets. Since then we engaged subservicers to provide loan servicing to borrowers and trustees on our behalf when we have been unable to divest those obligations. Complaints against the servicing provided often are directed first to us, as the servicer of record.Additional information concerning risks related to former servicing and foreclosure practices and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth under the captions “Repurchase Accrual Methodology” beginning on page 93, “Foreclosure Practices” beginning on page 96, and “Contingent Liabilities” beginning on page 99 of our 2019 MD&A (Item 7; and under the caption “Exposures from pre-2009 Mortgage Business” beginning on page 173, within Note 17-Contingencies and Other Disclosures, of our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8).Several large purchasers of mortgage-backed securities have filed suits against the trustees for those securitizations asserting various theories of liability. The trustee of our securitizations is defending such matters, and many of our securitizations are among those alleged to have been purchased by the plaintiffs. The claims for damages are based in part on allegations that the trustee did not properly or timely act against the originators of the securitizations or the servicers of the loans, and further assert that the trustee has affirmative duties to act which were not set forth in the legal trust documents. Some of the legal theories advanced are untested or unsettled. Although we are not a defendant in these proceedings, these complex suits may progress or evolve so as to compel us to defend ourselves or our trustee, and could create financial exposure for us. Reputation RisksOur ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and                  financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   27also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management.Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, also may result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.Political and social fragmentation in the U.S., combined with access to social media platforms, can increase reputation risk in ways that might not be easily avoided by traditional means. The predominant culture within the banking industry remains traditional: in order to preserve their business reputations, banks generally prefer to avoid  direct, public involvement in political or social controversy. Increasingly, though, certain groups-having highly specific political or social agendas and with the ability to communicate their views effectively using social media platforms-have made it more difficult to maintain a traditional approach. One group, for example, may publicly criticize a bank for having, as a customer, a business which “exploits” persons of limited financial means, while another group may criticize a bank for failing to have, as a customer, the same business which “serves” such persons in neighborhoods that many businesses avoid. As another example, a group may demand that a bank cease doing business with a specific business customer based on the customer’s industry or a specific business practice because that industry or practice, though legal, is objectionable to that group. While the potential for such demands has always existed, special interest groups today are more able and willing to publicize their criticisms, and some are willing to use factual exaggerations and inflammatory language in stating their views to the public. Those criticisms, in turn, ultimately may be acted upon by legislators or regulators.Credit RisksWe face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit charge-offs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary substantially over time. In the most recent credit cycle, net charge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007, and increased to $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline, $12.5 million in 2017, $16.1 million in 2018, and $27.1 million in 2019. In recent years, our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels. The allowance for loan loss was $200.3 million as of December 31, 2019, down substantially from $896.9 million and $849.2 million at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively. We have experienced very low levels of charge-offs in recent years, and have experienced some loan-loss recoveries from loans that were charged off during the last down cycle. Net charge-offs should increase at some point when the credit cycle moves into its next phase. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including real estate, among other things. We further manage credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, by following per-relationship lending limits, and by recording and managing an  allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty.We record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption “Accounting & Tax Risks” beginning on page 35, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to be more volatile, or to be recognized on an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. (In fact, as mentioned there, starting January 1, 2020, such an accounting change is applicable to us.) Moreover, the SEC or PCAOB could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other banking regulators. A significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon our reported FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   28financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could be misguided or otherwise affected with substantial adverse consequences to us. The recent low-interest rate environment has elevated the traditional challenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income or yield. This challenge applies not only to credit risk in lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding investments.If interest rates rise, default risk also rises. As borrowers’ obligations to pay interest increase, financial weaknesses become more evident. Initially this results in lower consumer credit scores and lower commercial loan grading, and later results in higher default rates.Credit losses tend to increase and decrease in a cyclical manner. Although the duration and timing of any given credit cycle is impossible to predict accurately, it is clear that we and other U.S. banks recently have experienced an extended period of very low credit losses, and that period followed several years of extremely high losses. It is inevitable that credit losses will rise well beyond current levels when the next cycle begins. It is extremely difficult for banks, and for investors, to know when an uptick in credit loss is merely idiosyncratic or instead portends a major credit cycle change.The composition of our loan portfolio inherently increases our sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2019, approximately 65% of total loans consisted of the commercial, financial, and industrial (C&I) category, while approximately 19% consisted of the consumer real estate category. The largest component of the C&I category at year end was loans to mortgage companies, a component which represented about 22% of the C&I category at that time. The second largest component was loans to finance and insurance companies. As a result, approximately 36% of the C&I category was sensitive to impacts on the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financial services industry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in real estate and other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions, than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industry could dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio.The consumer real estate category contains a number of concentrations which affect credit risk assessment of the category. •Product concentration. The consumer real estate category consists primarily of consumer installment loans, and much of the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit. •Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 20% of the category consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis. •Geographic concentration. At year end about 54% of the category related to Tennessee customers, 15% related to North Carolina, 13% related to Florida, 3% related to California, and no other state represented more than 3% of the category. •Legacy concentration. We still have approximately $.8 billion of loans originated before 2009 by our legacy national mortgage lending business. Those include loans we originated and did not sell, along with loans we have repurchased in the course of resolving claims with loan buyers. Our legacy loan portfolio continues to shrink, but the rate of shrinkage is slowing. The consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumer customers and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significant life events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer category and our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types.Volatility in the oil & gas industry can impact us. Our Houston office specializes in commercial lending. That office significantly focuses on three areas: energy, commercial real estate (CRE), and commercial, financial, & industrial (C&I). Much of our Houston business is connected, at least in part, to the energy industry, especially oil and gas production and distribution. In addition to general credit and other risks mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, the energy business and related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to that industry. Key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. The shifting balance between demand and supply is expressed most simply in prices. Significant oil-price volatility can and often does impact our overall business in this industry by increasing charge-offs and reducing demand for loans. Additional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions “Asset Quality-Trend Analysis of 2019 Compared to 2018” beginning on page 65, “Commercial Loan Portfolios” beginning on page 65, “Consumer Loan Portfolios” beginning on page 71, “Credit Risk Management” beginning on page 90, and “Allowance for Loan Losses” beginning on page 97 of our 2019 MD&A (Item 7).FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   29Service RisksWe provide a wide range of services to customers, and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we provided them in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Our services include lending, loan servicing, fiduciary, custodial, depositary, funds management, insurance, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision  processes. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captions “Operational Risk Management” and “Compliance Risk Management,” beginning on pages 89 and 90, respectively, of our 2019 MD&A (Item 7).Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks The regulatory environment continues to be challenging. We operate in a heavily regulated industry. Our regulatory burdens, including both operating restrictions and ongoing compliance costs, are substantial. We are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See “Supervision and Regulation” in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 8, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. The following paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related to regulatory matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do not describe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change.We and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios. U.S. capital standards are discussed in Item 1 of this report, in tabular and narrative form, under the caption “Capital Adequacy” starting on page 11. Pressures to maintain appropriate  capital levels and address business needs in a changing economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders. Such actions could include:  reduction or elimination of dividends; the issuance of common or preferred stock, or securities convertible into stock; or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of common or preferred stock.Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions “Capital Adequacy” and “Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)” in Item 1 of this report beginning on pages 11 and 12, respectively; under the captions “Capital-2019 Compared to 2018,” “Capital Risk Management and Adequacy,” and “Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends” beginning on pages 63, 89, and 96, respectively, of our 2019 MD&A (Item); and under the caption “Regulatory Capital” in Note 12-Regulatory Capital and Restrictions, beginning on page 164 of our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8).Legal disputes are an unavoidable part of business, and the outcome of pending or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty. We face the risk of litigation from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty.Typically, we are unable to estimate our loss exposure from legal claims until relatively late in the litigation process, which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigation unpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next. For most of our pending legal matters we have established either no accrual (reserve) or no significant reserve. Financial accounting guidance requires that litigation loss be both estimable and FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   30probable before a reserve may be established (recorded as a liability on our balance sheet). Under that guidance, reserves typically are not established for most litigation matters until after preliminary motions to dismiss or to narrow the case are resolved, after discovery is substantially in process, and (in many cases) after preliminary overtures regarding settlement have occurred. Potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserve is established. Moreover, many cases experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long period followed by a brief period of rapid development. Lastly, although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us, for the others our loss typically is recognized either all at once (near the time of resolution) or very unevenly over the life of the case. Additional information concerning litigation risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the caption “Legacy Mortgage Business Risks” beginning on page 26 of this report; under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations,” “Repurchase Accrual Methodology,” “Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends,” and “Contingent Liabilities” beginning on pages 93, 93, 96, and 99, respectively, of our 2019 MD&A (Item 7); and under the caption “Contingencies” in Note 17-Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 172 of our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8).Political dysfunction and volatility within the federal government, both at the regulatory and Congressional level, creates significant potential for major and abrupt shifts in federal policy regarding bank regulation, taxes, and the economy, any of which could have significant impacts on our business and financial performance. Moreover, political conflict within and among branches of government, and within and among government agencies, can rise to a level where day-to-day functions could be interrupted or impaired. Data privacy is becoming a major political concern.  The laws governing it are new, and are likely to evolve and expand. Many non-regulated, non-banking companies have gathered large amounts of personal details about millions of people, and have the ability to analyze that data and act on that analysis very quickly. This situation has prompted governmental responses. Two prominent responses are the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and the California Data Privacy Protection Act. Neither is a banking industry regulation, but both apply to banks in relation to certain customers. Further general regulation to protect data privacy appears likely, and banking industry regulations might be enlarged as well.Public expectations concerning corporate controls on emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases could increase our operating costs in the future without a corresponding increase in revenue, could curtail some aspects of our business, or both. At present, environmental regulations do not require us to monitor the direct or indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with building, operating, or maintaining our physical facilities, nor are we taxed or fined in relation to those emissions, because such gases generally are not considered to be pollutants under federal law. Changing expectations could pressure us to physically measure, monitor, and curtail direct emissions and to estimate indirect emissions or impacts, and eventually could result in legal requirements to take those actions or to pay for measured or estimated emissions. Whether or not legally required, any such actions that we take would increase our operating costs. In addition, such expectations could pressure us to discontinue business relationships with certain customers, or groups of customers, that have suboptimal reputations for emissions.Risks of Expense ControlOur ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change-whether by acquisition, expansion, or contraction-additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recent years we have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient  primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking and right-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usually entail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs, and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future. We have also focused our attention on the economic profit generated by our business activities and prospects rather than emphasizing revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attempts to relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returns on capital FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   31employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The process is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment and utilization of resources. Economic profit analysis involves significant judgment regarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitability over the long run. Despite our efforts, our costs could rise due to adverse structural changes or market shifts. For example, the overall cost of our health insurance benefit is highly dependent upon regulatory factors and market forces beyond our control.Geographic RisksWe are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions. To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If the southeastern U.S. were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader or different regional footprint. Examples of these kinds of risks include: earthquakes in Memphis; hurricanes in Florida, the Carolina coasts, or the Texas coast; a major change in health insurance laws impacting the many healthcare companies in middle Tennessee; and automotive industry plant closures.  We have international assets in the form of loans and letters of credit. Holding non-U.S. assets creates a number  of risks:  the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities; and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our ability to manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in legal, cultural, and other expectations applicable to customers, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed. InsuranceOur property and casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequate to cover the risks that we face, and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by insurers. We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the risk of default as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation.A portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact  on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified.We own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assets on our books. Some of those policies are “general account” and others are “separate account.” The general account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separate account policies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularly for the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantly limited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination.When we self-insure certain exposures, our estimates of future expenditures may be inadequate for the actual expenditures that occur. For example, we self-insure our employee health-insurance benefit program. We estimate future expenditures and establish accruals (reserves) based FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   32on the estimates. If actual expenditures were to exceed our estimates in a future period, our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased.   Liquidity and Funding RisksLiquidity is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidity, or an increase in the cost of liquidity, may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2019 were met principally by deposits, by financing from other financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets. Deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds and by far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. If interest rates rise, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly if a tipping point is reached, as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could pressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink our net interest margin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly.The market among banks for deposits may be impacted by current capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Institutions with less than $100 billion of assets are not required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. At or above $100 billion, the requirement increases with size and certain activities. The largest banks, which must maintain the highest minimum ratio, may be incented to compete for core deposits vigorously. Although mid-sized banks, like ours, are only lightly impacted by this rule, if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions we could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs. We also depend upon financing from private institutional or other investors by means of the capital markets. In 2015 we issued $500 million of senior holding-company notes due 2020. The 2015 notes refinanced an earlier five-year notes issue. Presently we believe we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may become unavailable to us for reasons beyond our control.A number of more general factors could make funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may remain or become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control.Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business. As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit.Credit RatingsOur credit ratings directly affect the availability and cost of our unsecured funding. FHN and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. At December 31, 2019, both rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of FHN and of the Bank as investment grade.  The ratings outlook was stable from  Moody’s and from Fitch for both FHN and the Bank. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   33buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.Reductions in our credit ratings could result in counterparties reducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restricting the business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold.Reductions in our credit ratings could allow some counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to  settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. Under our margin agreements, we are required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties. At this time, those of our ISDA master agreements which have ratings triggers reference the lower of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC or Moody’s ratings. If a credit rating downgrade had occurred as of December 31, 2019, the maximum specified additional collateral we would have been required to post would have been approximately $1 million.Interest Rate and Yield Curve RisksWe are subject to interest rate risk because a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. A significant portion of our funding comes from short-term and demand deposits, while a significant portion of our lending and investing is in medium-term and long-term instruments. Changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. In addition, our fixed income segment tends to perform better when rates decline or markets are volatile, which tends to partially offset net interest margin compression.A flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interest margin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve usually is upwardly sloped (higher rates for longer terms). However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted (sloped downward), which happened several times in 2018 and 2019. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business. We appear to be in a waiting period in terms of interest rate policy; the uncertainties of the direction, magnitude, and timing of future rate actions could adversely affect us. The Federal Reserve raised short-term rates by 0.25% four times in 2018 and reduced rates by 0.25% three times in 2019. The 2018 actions flattened the yield curve. The 2019 actions steepened the curve only very modestly. The Federal Reserve has signaled no direction for rate changes in 2020 or 2021. If rates in fact  remain stable and market participants come to expect long-term stability, the yield curve may steepen to a more normal shape, which should benefit us. However, in the meantime, in many respects the impact on us of uncertain interest rate policy is likely to be uneven, with benefits and detriments that are difficult to predict. See “Risks Associated with Monetary Events” beginning on page 25 of this report for additional information.Market-indexed deposit products are very sensitive to changes in short-term rates, and our use of them increases our exposure to such changes. Expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed income business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.The likely discontinuance of LIBOR as a viable benchmark rate after 2021 may adversely affect our business and our operating results. In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. As a result, LIBOR as currently operated may not continue after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. There are serious doubts that LIBOR will continue after 2021 in a form that will be practical.At this time, it is not clear which rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. The leading alternative rate in the U.S., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, is not directly comparable to LIBOR and cannot easily or simply be substituted for it in outstanding instruments. Key differences between the two are: SOFR is FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   34based on secured lending, LIBOR is not; and SOFR historically has been published only as an overnight rate, while LIBOR is published in several short-term maturity periods. (Starting in March 2020, a compounded average SOFR will be published for periods of 30, 90, and 120 days, which is intended to address the latter difference.) It is impossible to predict the effect of SOFR or any other alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans. Our primary exposures to LIBOR are in variable-rate loans and in hedging transactions. We are not able to determine the impact on us that LIBOR discontinuance will have. The simplicity and long history of using LIBOR, the lack of a definite alternative, and the possibility that different alternatives ultimately may be used in different circumstances, means that LIBOR continues to be used in many new instruments. In addition, it is not known how a transition away from LIBOR, or to a new version of LIBOR, will impact our ability to use hedge accounting after 2021. However, accounting and tax agencies have issued preliminary guidance that should ease that transition.A few instruments issued by us, including the Bank’s Class A Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock and  certain trust preferred obligations, have floating rate terms based on LIBOR. As mentioned above, it is not known whether LIBOR will continue after 2021 in a workable form. We have risk that an adverse outcome of the LIBOR transition after 2021 could increase our interest, dividend, and other costs relative to those instruments. We may not be able to refinance those instruments on terms that reduce those costs to the level we would have expected if LIBOR were to continue indefinitely, unchanged. Additionally, a transition from LIBOR could adversely impact or change our hedge accounting practices.Asset Inventories and Market RisksThe trading securities inventories and loans held for sale in our fixed income business are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securities inventory and loan positions for purposes of distribution to customers, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributable principally to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with those assets. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities and loans through certain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. Average fixed income trading securities (long positions) were $1.4 billion for 2019, $1.6 billion for 2018, and $1.2 billion for 2017. Average fixed income trading liabilities (short positions) were $0.5 billion, $0.7 billion, and $0.7 billion for 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Average loans held for sale in our fixed income business were $0.5 billion, $0.6 billion, and $0.3 billion for 2019, 2018, and 2017. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “Market Risk Management” beginning on page 87 of our 2019 MD&A (Item 7).Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for  customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.Significant changes to the securities market’s performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results.An example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims, the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims, and estimates of plan asset values. Our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors. Accordingly, our obligations diminish if the plan’s investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance, and can grow if those investments perform poorly or if expectations worsen. A rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impact the values of fixed income assets held in the plan, but would also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure the present value of future benefit payments. Similarly, our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarial inputs.  We manage the risk of rate changes by investing FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   35plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities aligned with the expected timing of payouts. Because there are no new participants, the actuarial-input risk should slowly diminish over time.Changes in our funding obligation generally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Our obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employee population and changes to the plan itself. Although we have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable. Our hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequately hedge our risks, and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various, though  not all, financial risks. For example: our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on a portion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; and, we use derivatives, including swaps, swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Generally, in the latter example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans.Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings.Accounting & Tax RisksThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements.  The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for credit losses. However, other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length, for example the valuation (or impairment) of our deferred tax assets. Estimates are made at specific points in time. As actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, often we are unable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process.We lack first-hand visibility regarding certain loans, other assets, or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. For example, interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties requires that the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessing the collectability and inherent loss of a performing junior lien. We own and service a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. As of December 31, 2019, that amount was $6.0 billion. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $.9 billion, or 15%, of the consumer real estate portfolio  consisted of stand-alone second liens while $.1 billion, or 2%, were second liens whose first liens are owned or serviced by FHN. We are not able to actively monitor the performance status of the first liens that are serviced by others. We obtain first lien performance information from third parties and through loss mitigation activities, and we place a stand-alone second lien loan on nonaccrual if we discover that there are performance issues with the first lien loan. It is possible that if our evaluation methods change or information sources otherwise improve our additions to nonperforming loans may be material. Changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operations of companies within the same industry. One such accounting change, ASU 2016-13, “Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” substantially revises the measurement and recognition of credit losses for certain assets, including most loans, in a manner that will substantially and adversely change when and how we recognize loan loss. ASU 2016-13 is effective for us on January 1, 2020. Under ASU 2016-13, when we make or acquire a new loan that is covered by the standard, we will be required to recognize immediately the “current expected credit loss,” or “CECL,” of that loan. We will also re-evaluate CECL each quarter that the loan is outstanding. CECL is the difference between our cost and the net amount we expect to collect over the life of the loan using certain estimation methods and our experience with other, similar loans. In contrast, the current accounting standard FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   36delays recognition of credit loss until loss is “probable” (very likely). We adopted ASU 2016-13 and CECL accounting starting in 2020, with the impact on regulatory capital having a short phase-in period. Starting in 2020, recognition of estimated credit loss will be significantly accelerated compared to pre-CECL practice. Additional information concerning ASU 2016-13 and its effects upon us appears in Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies within our 2019 Financial Statements (Item 8), under the heading “Accounting Changes Issued but Not Currently Effective” beginning on page 132, which information is incorporated into this Item 1A by reference.In comparison with former (pre-2020) standards, CECL accounting likely will: result in a significant increase in our loan loss provision (expense) and allowance (reserve) during any period of loan growth, including organic growth and growth created by acquisition or merger; through the increased provision, adversely impact our earnings and, correspondingly, our regulatory capital levels; and enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year, especially during times when the economy is in transition. Moreover, CECL creates an incentive for banks to reduce new lending in the “down” part of the economic cycle in order to reduce loss  recognition and conserve regulatory capital. That perverse incentive could, nationwide, prolong a down cycle in the economy and delay a recovery. Changes in regulatory rules can create significant accounting impacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accounting standards. Changes in those standards can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financial reporting.Our Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented. Internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures (“controls and procedures”) must be effective in order to provide assurance that financial reports are materially accurate. A failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Stock-Holding and Governance RisksThe principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock, as well as service our debt, is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank may become unable to pay dividends to us without regulatory approval. We primarily depend upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our common and preferred stockholders, and to service our outstanding debt. Regulatory constraints might prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to us in 2020 without regulatory approval. Applying the applicable regulatory rules, at January 1, 2020, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank's common or preferred stock of approximately $331.2 million without obtaining regulatory approval. Also, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank. Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable for dividends.Furthermore, the Federal Reserve has issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company’s net income available to  shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company’s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Our stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders. We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that would be dilutive to stockholders in terms of voting power and share-of-ownership, and could be dilutive financially or economically. The IBKC merger, for example, will result in a significant increase in our outstanding shares. We estimate that immediately after the IBKC merger, FHN will issue to former IBKC shareholders FHN common FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP.  2019 FORM 10-K ANNUAL REPORT   37shares representing about 44% of our post-closing outstanding shares; legacy FHN shareholders will own only about 56% of the post-closing outstanding shares. We hope to mitigate the financial and economic (per-share) dilutive effects of that issuance by integrating IBKC’s businesses and operations with our current businesses and operations effectively and at an acceptable level of cost, and as a result achieving net expense reductions and net revenue increases in comparison with the two companies on a stand-alone basis. A key risk is that we will fail to achieve one or more of those results.Our issuance of preferred stock raises regulatory capital without issuing common shares, but creates or expands our general obligation to pay all preferred dividends ahead of any common dividends. Currently we have two series of preferred stock outstanding, one issued by the Bank and one by FHN. After the IBKC merger closes, FHN will have outstanding three additional series of preferred stock. Subject to capital needs and market conditions, additional series may be issued in the future.Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders. In addition, federal banking laws prohibit non-financial-industry companies from owning a bank, and require regulatory approval of any change in control of a bank.Certain legal rights of holders of our stock to pursue claims against us are limited by our bylaws. Our bylaws have an exclusive forum clause which provides, unless we  consent in writing to an alternative forum, that a state or federal court located within Shelby County in the State of Tennessee will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought in the right of FHN, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer or other employee of FHN to FHN or its shareholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against FHN or any director, officer or other employee of FHN arising pursuant to any provision of the Tennessee Business Corporation Act, of FHN’s charter, or of its bylaws, or (iv) any action asserting a claim against FHN or any director, officer or other employee of FHN that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. The bylaws’ exclusive forum clause may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against FHN or its directors, officers or other employees, or against the depositary, as applicable. The clause also may lead to increased costs to bring a claim, or may limit the ability of holders of FHN’s stock to bring a claim in a judicial forum they find favorable. In addition, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the exclusive forum clause will apply to any actions or proceedings described in the four categories specified above that arise or purport to arise under the federal securities laws, including those under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and/or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. To the extent the exclusive forum clause restricts the courts in which holders of our stock may bring claims arising under the federal securities laws, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the clause. The exclusive forum clause does not mean that holders of FHN’s stock have waived FHN’s obligations to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder.---------------------------"

Our primary areas of competition for customers include: consumerand commercial deposits, commercial loans, consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, financial planning andwealth management, fixed income products and services, and other consumer and commercial financial products and services. Our competitorsin these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies,trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securitiesfirms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies (traditional and otherwise) that serve themarkets which we serve. The emergence of non-traditional, disruptive service providers (see “Industry Disruption” beginningon page 19) has intensified the competitive environment. Some competitors are traditional banks, subject to the same regulatoryframework as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree of regulation.Long-standing examples of less-regulated activity include check-cashing and independent ATM services. A recent example of unregulatedactivity is so-called “peer-to-peer” lending, where investors provide debt financing and/or capital directly to borrowers. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intensewith respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affecteditems, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both.

In the past four years wehave mixed organic growth with tactical acquisitions and a strategic acquisition (Capital Bank).Organically, we have enhanced our market share in our traditionalbanking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into other southeast U.S. markets with similar characteristics, andexpanded with commercial lending and private client banking in the Houston, Texas market. We have made similar moves in ourfixed income business. Our acquisitions in the past four years have included two banks,commercial loan portfolios, a commercial loan placement and servicing business, and a fixed income firm specializing in governmentguaranteed loans.18In the future, we expect to continue to nurture profitable organicgrowth. We may pursue acquisitions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves. Webelieve that the successful execution of organic growth depends upon a number of key elements, including:  ●our ability to attract and retain customers in our banking market areas;  ●our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities;  ●in our fixed income business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same timeidentifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers;  ●our ability to maintain a high level of customer service while optimizing our physical branch count due to changing customerdemand, all while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information processing, technology, compliance,and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;  ●our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-fundedacquisitions; and  ●our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex, burdensome, and evolvingregulatory environment. Failure to achieve one or more key elements would adversely affectour business and earnings. We have inplace strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present.Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions,we face various additional risks, including:  ●our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisitionand to price the transaction appropriately;  ●our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;  ●our ability to manage cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions, which is an often-overlookedand often-critical failure point in mergers;  ●our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and  ●our ability to retain core customers and key employees of the acquired company. A type of strategic acquisition—a so-called “mergerof equals” where the company we nominally acquire has similar size, operating contribution, or value—presents uniqueopportunities but also unique risks. Those special risks include:  ●the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies efficiently ina reasonable amount of time; and  ●a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before substantial economies of scale can be realized. IndustryDisruption Through technological innovations and changes in customer habits,the manner in which customers use financial services is changing. We provide a large number of services remotely (desktop,online, or mobile), and physical branch utilization has been in long-term decline throughout the industry for many years. Technologyhas helped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has weakened traditional geographic ties and allowed disruptors to entertraditional banking areas. Through digital marketing and service platforms, many banks aremaking customer inroads unrelated to physical presence. This competitive risk is especially pronounced from the largest U.S. banks,and fromonline-only banks, due in part to the investments they are able to sustain in their digital platforms. Companies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse)and Starbucks (a large chain of cafes) provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possibleuntil recent times. The nature of technology-driven disruption to our industry ischanging, in some cases seeking to displace traditional financial service providers rather than merely enhance traditional servicesor their delivery. A number of recent technologies have worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks, suchas the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit19cards into smart phones. These sorts of technologies often haveexpanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banksand disrupting prior methods of delivering those services. But some recent innovations may tend to replace traditional banks asfinancial service providers rather than merely augment those services. For example, companies which claim to offer applications and servicesbased on artificial intelligence are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areasinvolving personal advice, including high-margin services such as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost, high-speednature of these “robo-advisor” services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent customers and potentialcustomers. Similarly, crypto-currencies and other inventions based on blockchaintechnology eventually may be the foundation for greatly enhancing transactional security throughout the banking industry, but alsomay eventually greatly reduce the need for banks as financial deposit-keepers and intermediaries. We believe that, over the course of the technology-driven evolutionof our industry which is well underway, the “winners” will be those institutions which can know their customers andmake those customers feel they are known, even when many customers increasingly do not visit branches or have face-to-facelive interaction. Two keys to achieving a psychological connection with such customers are (1) data management and analytics,using artificial intelligence processes, which allow an institution to provide a differentiated, personalized experience for thecustomer at the point of interaction, and (2) seamless integration of real-time customer contact with a human being through voice,chat, or otherwise. A critical factor in successful data analytics, allowing real-timedifferentiated interaction with customers, is how traditionally uncaptured, unstructured, or siloed data is acquired, managed,and accessed. Some banks are experimenting with different methods of addressing this business need, and many more will follow.In addition, external vendors are developing processes to provide solutions. A basic challenge for all these efforts is how tointegrate analysis of extremely disparate forms of data and utilize that analysis in each customer contact.Developing workable proprietary solutions to the data analyticschallenges ahead of competitors requires substantial investment in information technology systems and innovation. Evenwith a substantial IT budget, we cannot outspend, or even come close to matching, the largest U.S. banking institutions. Therefore,like most U.S. banks, our strategy must be focused on leveraging products and solutions which are within our means, including thosedeveloped by external vendors. Our goal must be to keep pace with industry developments with a focus on improving the customer’sdifferentiated experience with us. Technological innovation has tended to reduce barriers to entrybased on cost. Put another way, once someone finds a new, better method to accomplish a task in our industry, often others areable to replicate or improve on that method, sometimes quite rapidly. Key risks for us, therefore, are whether we will be able:to catch up to breakthroughs quickly enough to avoid customer attrition; to enhance breakthroughs frequently enough to attractcustomers from competitors; and, if we are able to truly innovate, to press our advantage quickly before competitors adopt it. To thrive as our industry is disrupted, we will need to embracesome of the attitudes of a technology company, and shed some of the attitudes of a traditional bank. This has and will continueto require an evolution in our corporate culture which, in turn, creates implementation risk. In this process it is critical thatwe not lose sight of how our customers experience working with us and our systems, including customers who still want traditionally-deliveredservices, those who seek and embrace the latest innovations, and those who just want services to be convenient, personalized, andunderstandable. Just as disruptive business changes driven by new technologiesand new customer preferences can adversely impact us and our entire industry, similar events can adversely impact our commercialcustomers. In time, a major business disruption can cause dominant businesses to fail, and can shrink or even end entire linesof business. An example of this is the business failure of the Blockbuster video distribution chain and most other video distributionstores, and the rise of Netflix. Many other examples of this kind of process are ongoing today in many industries, including publishing,retail sales, news, and the creation as well as distribution of audio and video entertainment. To the extent disruptions impactour customers, we may experience elevated loan losses and loss of ongoing business which we may not be able to recapture with newcustomers.20OperationalRisks Fraud is a major, and increasing, operational risk for us andall banks. Two traditional areas, deposit fraud (check kiting, wire fraud, etc.) and loan fraud, continue to be major sourcesof fraud attempts and loss. The methods used to perpetrate and combat fraud continue to evolve as technology changes. Our anti-fraudactions are both preventive (anticipating lines of attack, educating employees and customers, etc.) and responsive (remediatingactual attacks). Our regulators require us and all banks to report fraud promptly. Regulators often advise banks of new schemesso that the entire industry can adapt as quickly as possible. However, the some level of fraud loss is unavoidable, and the riskof a major loss cannot be eliminated. Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent inpart upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manageexpenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in manyways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes; faultyor disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related securitybreaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may presentthemselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, information technologysystems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, malware, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficientlyadaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable.Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challenges as we striveto maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost. A serious information technology security (cybersecurity) breachcan cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damagecan occur due to outright theft or extortion of our funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers, or adverse publicityassociated with a breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certain vendors,all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because ofthe potentially very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to addressinternal and externalsecurity concerns to a high degree, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulationspertaining to bank safety and customer protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others aremuch older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft,and other electronic crimes, and we educate our customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications.We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue toevolve. The operational functions we outsource to third parties may experiencesimilar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limited abilityto obtain quickly an alternate vendor. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions,the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult. The operational functions of business counterparties may experiencedisruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in recent years severalmajor U.S. retailers, a major electronic mail provider, and a major credit reporting firm all experienced data systems incursionsreportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other data of millionsof customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Althoughour systems are not breached in retailer incursions, these events can increase account fraud and can cause us to reissue a significantnumber of account cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our customers. Our abilityto recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations. Other possible points of incursion or disruptionnot within our control include internet service providers, social media portals, distant-server (“cloud”) service providers,electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers. Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure,failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructurecomponents suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable regulatorystandards. Additional information concerning21operational risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporatedinto this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “Operational Risk Management” beginning on page 52 ofthe Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report,which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. The delivery of financial services to customers and others increasinglydepends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risks discussedelsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untested technologiesinclude: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectual propertyinfringement. Competition for talent is substantial and increasing. Moreover,revenue growth in some business lines increasingly depends upon top talent. In recent years the cost to us of hiring and retainingtop revenue-producing talent has increased, and that trend is likelyto continue. The primary tools we use to attract and retaintalent are: salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severancebenefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively,we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively. Incentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverse effects.Incentive programs are difficult to design well, and even if well-designed often they must be updated to address changes in ourbusiness. A poorly designed incentive program—where goals are too difficult, too easy, or not well related to desired outcomes—couldprovide little useful motivation to key employees, could increase turnover, and could impact customer retention. Moreover, evenwhere those pitfalls are avoided, incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences. For example, a program focusedentirely on revenue production, without proper controls, may result in costs growing faster than revenues. Riskfrom Economic Downturns and Changes  Generally, in an economic downturn, our credit losses increase,demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and creditlosses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressureon collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financialservices may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economicfactors that impact demand for loans andother financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in employmentrates, interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or otheradverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses,lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin, and lower fees from transactions andservices. Those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends. RisksAssociated with Monetary Events The Federal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategiesthat have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve. These strategies have had, and willcontinue to have, a significant impact on our business and on many of our customers. In response to the recession in 2008 andthe following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives. Several of these emphasizedso-called quantitative easing strategies, the most recent of which ended during 2014. The FederalReserve raised rates five times during 2015-2017, in each caseby a modest 25 basis points, and began reversing its easing strategy. In 2018 the Federal Reserve raised rates four moretimes, also by 25 basis points each. The last two raises were followed by substantial volatility in the U.S. stock market,and the last raise was accompanied by a substantial and broad stock market decline. In early 2019 the Federal Reserve seemedto signal a pause in rate increases.22Federal Reserve strategies can, and often are intended to, affectthe domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve often aremost pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things, easingstrategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economic activity,while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply, and restraineconomic activity. Many external factors may interfere with the effects of these plansor cause them to be changed, sometimes quickly. Such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significantinternational monetary policies and events. Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways thatmay be difficult to predict. Risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item 1A under the caption“Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks” beginning on page 31.We may be adversely affected by economic and politicalsituations outside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our customers, are linked significantly toeconomic and market conditions outside the U.S., especially in North America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in Centraland South America. Although we have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or non-US sovereign debt, inthe future major adverse events outside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potentialevents which could have such an impact include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in theirborrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses becomeespecially severe, (iv) the collapse of governments, alliances, or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods bywhich such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following: an increase in our cost ofborrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailability of borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon ourhedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our customers; impacts upon the U.S. economy, especially in the areas ofemployment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts upon us from our regulatoryenvironment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to major financialdisruptions. RisksRelated to Businesses We May Exit We may be unable to successfully implement a disposition of businessesor units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adapt to a changingbusiness and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include:  ●our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;  ●our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;    ●our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and  ●our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cashexpenditures or financial loss. LegacyMortgage Business Risks We have risks from the mortgage-related businesses we exited,including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, claims of non-compliancewith contractual and regulatory requirements, and the risk of higher default rates on loans made by our former businesses. In2008 we exited our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses. However, we still retain as assets a significantamount of loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated acrossthe U.S. We retain the risk of liability tocustomers and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating thosebusinesses. These legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:  ●We are contending with, and defending litigation matters associated with, claims arising out of our former (pre-2009) mortgageorigination and sale activities. Currently, many of these are indemnity claims. The outcome of those matters is uncertain; lossesin excess of current accruals (reserves) could be material. Although some types of new23   claims and actions no longer arelegally viable due to the passage of time, others could still arise.    ●We could be subject to claims that servicing-related actions were done improperly, or improperly were not done. Although wemay be able to demand indemnity in cases where servicing was performed on our behalf by another institution, there is risk thatsuch an indemnity demand could be refused by the institution or rejected by an appropriate court. Additional information concerning risks related to our formermortgage businesses and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is setforth: under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other ContractualObligations” beginning on page 57, “Obligations from Legacy Mortgage Businesses” beginning on page57, “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 59, “Foreclosure Practices” beginningon page 61, and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 62 of the Management’s Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of thematerial from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under thecaptions “Material Matters” and “Other Former Mortgage Business Exposures”, both beginning on page132, which is part of the material from our 2018 Annual Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of thisreport. We have exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligationsand assets which we retained after we generally sold our mortgage businesses in 2008, especially in relation to the subservicingarrangements we made between 2008 and the sale of substantially all our remaining servicing assets completed in 2014. Whenwe sold our origination and servicing businesses in 2008 we retained significant servicing obligations and assets. Since then weengaged subservicers to provide loan servicing toborrowers and trustees on our behalf when we have been unable to divest thoseobligations. Complaints against the servicing provided often are directed first to us, as the servicer of record. Additional information concerning risks related to formerservicing and foreclosure practices and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by thisreference, is set forth under the captions “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page59, “Foreclosure Practices” beginning on page 61, and“Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 62 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of the material from thatreport that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption “Other Former MortgageBusiness Exposures” beginning on page 132, which is part of the material from our 2018 Annual Report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Several large purchasers of mortgage-backed securities have filedsuits against the trustees for those securitizations asserting various theories of liability. The trustee of our securitizationsis defending such matters, and many of our securitizations are among those alleged to have been purchased by the plaintiffs. Theclaims for damages are based in part on allegations that the trustee did not properly or timely act against the originators ofthe securitizations or the servicers of the loans, and further assert that the trustee has affirmative duties to act which werenot set forth in the legal trust documents. Some of the legal theories advanced are untested or unsettled. Although we are nota defendant in these proceedings, these complex suits may progress or evolve so as to compel us to defend ourselves or our trustee,and could create financial exposure for us. ReputationRisks  Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtainand retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and financial stability. Ourreputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practicesare perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole,also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationshipsmay adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management.Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access thecapital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones,could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our abilityto attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry,may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business oroperations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.24CreditRisks We face the risk that our customers may not repay their loansand that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that other counterparties,in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit charge-offsis unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary substantially over time. In the most recent credit cycle, netcharge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007, and increased to $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginningin 2010, net charge-offs began to decline, reaching $19.2 million in 2016, $12.5 million in 2017, and $16.1 millionin 2018. In recent years, our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels. The allowance for loan loss was $180.4million as of December 31, 2018, down substantially from $896.9 million and $849.2 million at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively.We have experienced very low levels of charge-offs in recent years. Charge-offs should increase at some point when the credit cyclemoves into its next phase. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our abilityto assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including real estate,among other things. We further manage lending credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, by followingper-relationship lending limits, and by recording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentioned aboveand in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, someof which are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having toomuch risk concentrated with any single counterparty. We record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatoryguidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption “Accounting & Tax Risks” beginning on page33, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to be more volatile, or to be recognizedon an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC or PCAOBcould take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the Federal Reserve,OCC, or other banking regulators.A significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other modelsand approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in realestate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, based on ourexperience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon our reportedfinancial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses.To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions couldbe misguided or otherwise affected with substantial adverse consequences to us. A significant subset of our home equity lines of credit were originatedprior to our mortgage platform sale in 2008. A large number of those loans recently have switched from interest-only payments tofull amortization payments of principal and interest combined. In reserving for potential loss in this portfolio we model an increasedrate of default associated with the higher monthly payment requirements when that switch occurs. Our modeling is based, among otherthings, on our experience with this portfolio, but risk remains that actual default rates could exceed our modeling.  The recent low-interest rate environment has elevated the traditionalchallenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income or yield. This challengeapplies not only to credit risk in lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding investments. As interest rates rise, default risk also rises. As borrowers’obligations to pay interest increase, financial weaknesses become more evident. Initially this results in lower consumer creditscores and lower commercial loan grading, and later results in higher default rates. Credit losses tend to increase and decrease in a cyclical manner.Although the duration and timing of any given credit cycle is impossible to predict accurately, it is clear that we and otherU.S. banks recently have experienced an extended period of very low credit losses; that period followed several years of extremelyhigh losses. It is inevitable that credit losses will rise well beyond 2017 and 2018 levels when the 25next cycle begins. Because it is difficult to recognize when thecredit cycle changes, it is possible that the next cycle already has begun. The composition of our loan portfolio inherently increases oursensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2018, approximately 60% of total loans consisted of the commercial,financial, and industrial (C&I) category, while approximately 23% consisted of the consumer real estate category. The largest component of the C&I category at year end was loansto finance and insurance companies, a component which represented about 17% of the C&I category at that time. The secondlargest component was loans to mortgage companies. As a result, approximately 29% of the C&I category was sensitive toimpacts on the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financial servicesindustry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in real estateand other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions, than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industrycould dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio. The consumer real estate category contains a number of concentrationswhich affect credit risk assessment of the category.  ●Product concentration. The consumer real estate category consists primarily of consumer installment loans, and muchof the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit.  ●Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 24% of thecategory consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis.  ●Geographic concentration. At year end about 54% of the category related to Tennessee customers, 15% relatedto North Carolina, 13% related to Florida, 3% related to California, and no other state represented more than 3%of the category.     ●Legacy concentration. We still have approximately $1 billion of loans originated before 2009 by our  legacy national mortgage lending business. Those includeloans we originated and did not sell, along with loans we have repurchased in the course of resolving claims with loan buyers.Our legacy loan portfolio continues to shrink, but the rate of shrinkage is slowing. The consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economicimpacts on consumer customers and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significantlife events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer categoryand our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types. Volatility in the oil & gas industry can impact us. OurHouston office specializes in commercial lending, which in that office significantly focuses on three areas: energy, commercialreal estate (CRE), and commercial, financial, & industrial (C&I). Much of our Houston business is connected, at least inpart, to the energy industry, especially oil and gas production and distribution. In addition to general credit and other risksmentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, the energy business and related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to thatindustry. Key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. The shifting balancebetween demand and supply is expressed most simply in prices. Significant oil-price volatility can and often does impact our overallbusiness in this industry by increasing charge-offs and reducing demand for loans. Additional information concerning credit risks and our managementof them is set forth under the captions “Asset Quality—Trend Analysis of 2018 Compared to 2017” beginning on page 28, “Commercial Loan Portfolios”beginning on page 28, “Consumer Loan Portfolios” beginning on page 34, “Credit Risk Management” beginningon page 53, and “Allowance for Loan Losses” beginning on page 61 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. ServiceRisks We provide a wide range of services to customers,and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we provided them in a mannerthat harmed the customer or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Our services includelending, loan servicing, fiduciary,custodial, depositary, funds management, insurance, and advisory services, among others. Wemanage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Additional informationconcerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into26this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captions “OperationalRisk Management” and “Compliance Risk Management,” beginning on pages 52 and 53, respectively, of the Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of thematerial from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. Regulatory,Legislative, and Legal Risks  The regulatory environment is challenging. We operate ina heavily regulated industry. Our regulatory burdens, including both operating restrictions and ongoing compliance costs, are substantial. We are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securities brokerageand underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in theU.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations couldresult in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increaseour costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See “Supervision and Regulation” in Item1 of this report, beginning on page 7, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and stateregulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we aresubject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas ofemployment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changing theseregulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could furtherrestrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the products and serviceswe offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also couldexpand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share, receive, or usecustomer information and increasing our costs. In addition, privacy and other regulations outside of the U.S. could affect howwe are able to conduct business with customers outside the U.S. The following paragraphs highlight certain specific important riskareas related to regulatory matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do not describeall such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstances change.We and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatorycapital levels and ratios. U.S. capital standards are discussed in Item 1 of this report, in tabular and narrative form, underthe caption “Capital Adequacy” starting on page 9. Pressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and address businessneeds in a changing economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders. Such actions couldinclude: reduction or elimination of dividends; the issuance of common or preferred stock, or securities convertible into stock;or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of commonor preferred stock. Additional information concerning these risks and our managementof them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions “Capital Adequacy”and “Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)” in Item 1 of this report beginning on pages 9 and 10, respectively; under the captions“Capital—2018 Compared to 2017,” “Capital Management and Adequacy,” and “Market Uncertaintiesand Prospective Trends” beginning on pages 23, 52, and 61, respectively, of the Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption “Regulatory Capital” in Note12—Regulatory Capital and Restrictions, beginning on page 122 of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of the material fromthat report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Legal disputes are an unavoidable part of business, and the outcomeof pending or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty. We face the risk of litigation from customers,employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators.We manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethicsprocesses, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled withany certainty.27Typically, we are unable to estimate our loss exposure from legalclaims against us until relatively late in the litigation process, which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigation unpredictableand highly uneven from one period to the next. Currently we are defending a number of legal matters. For most of them we haveestablished either no accrual (reserve) or no significant reserve. Financial accounting guidance requires that litigation lossbe both estimable and probable before a reserve may be established (recorded as a liability on our balance sheet). Under that guidance,reserves typically are not established for most litigation matters until after preliminary motions to dismiss or to narrow thecase are resolved, after discovery is substantially in process, and (in many cases) after preliminary overtures regarding settlementhave occurred. Potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserve is established.Moreover, it is not uncommon for a case to experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long period followed bya brief period of rapid development. Lastly, although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us, for the others losstypically is recognized either all at once (near the time of resolution) or very unevenly over the life of the case. Additional information concerning litigation risks and our managementof them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the caption “Legacy Mortgage BusinessRisks” beginningon page 23 of this report; under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,and Other Contractual Obligations,” “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability,” “Market Uncertainties and ProspectiveTrends,” and “Contingent Liabilities” beginning on pages 57, 59, 61, and 64, respectively, of the Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of thematerial from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption “Contingencies”in Note 17—Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 131 of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Political dysfunction and volatility within the federal government,both at the regulatory and Congressional level, creates significant potential for major and abrupt shifts in federal policy regardingbank regulation, taxes, and the economy, any of which could have significant impacts on our business and financial performance.Moreover, political conflict within and among branches of government, and within and among government agencies, can rise toa level where day-to-day functions could be interrupted or impaired. Risksof Expense Control  Our ability to successfully manage expenses is important to ourlong-term survival and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence the amountof our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change—whether by acquisition, expansion, or contraction—additionalexpenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, amongother things. We manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety of means,including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recent yearswe have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking and right-sizingour physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usually entail additionalnear-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs,and severancecosts, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future.  We have also focused our attention on the economic profit generatedby our business activities and prospects rather than emphasizing revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attemptsto relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returnson capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The processis intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment and utilization of resources. Economic profit analysis involves significantjudgment regarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminishedprofitability over the long run. Despite our efforts, our costs could rise due to adverse structuralchanges or market shifts. For example, the overall cost of our health insurance benefit is highly dependent upon regulatory factorsand market forces beyond our control.28GeographicRisks We are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions.To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarilyimpact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If the southeastern U.S. were to experienceadversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitorswhich have a broader or different regional footprint. Examples of these kinds of risks include: earthquakes in Memphis; hurricanesin Florida, the Carolina coasts, or the Texas coasts; a major change in health insurance laws impacting the many healthcare companiesin middle Tennessee; and automotive industry plant closures.We have international assets in the form of loans and lettersof credit. Holding non-U.S. assets creates a number of risks:  the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions, and otherbarriers and constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk thatcurrency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollarvalue of liabilities; and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our abilityto manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differencesin legal, cultural, and other expectations applicable to customers, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties;and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed.  Insurance Our property and casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequateto cover the risks that we face, and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by insurers. We use insurance to managea number of risks, including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured,in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For thoserisks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse tohonor them. We treat the risk of default as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and bystriving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith,is inherent in any contractual situation. A portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage defaultinsurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adverselyaffect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provisionor write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financialresults. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades orinsolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impactwould be amplified. We own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assets on ourbooks. Some of those policies are “general account” and others are “separate account.” The general accountpolicies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separate accountpolicies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie thosepolicies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularlyfor the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantlylimited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon earlypolicy termination. When we self-insure certain exposures, our estimates of futureexpenditures may be inadequate for actual expenditures that occur. For example, we self-insure our employee health-insurancebenefit program. We estimate future expenditures and establish accruals (reserves) based on the estimates. If actual expenditureswere to exceed our estimates in a future period, our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased.29Liquidityand Funding Risks Liquidity is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidityor an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financial conditionsand cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positivelyor negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2018 were met principally by deposits, by financing fromother financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets. Deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable funds andby far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. As the economy improves andmarket rates rise, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly if a tipping point is reached, as depositors becomemore comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could pressure us to raise our deposit rates, whichcould shrink our net interest margin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly. The market among banks for deposits may be impacted bythe Basel III capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Moreover, institutionswith more than $50 billion of assets are required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. The largest banks, whichmust maintain the highest minimum ratio, may be incented to compete for core deposits vigorously. Although mid-sized banks,like ours, are not directly impacted by this rule, if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions we could losedeposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs.We also depend upon financing from private institutional or otherinvestors by means of the capital markets. In 2014 we issued $400 million of senior Bank notes due 2019, and in 2015 we issued$500 million of senior holding-company notes due 2020. The 2015 notes refinanced an earlier five-year notes issue. Presently webelieve we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may becomeunavailable to us for reasons beyond our control. A number of more general factors could make funding more difficult,more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or politicalchanges, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets,specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolioor other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions,general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. Inaddition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial marketsas well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may remain or become increasingly difficultdue to economic and other factors beyond our control. Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factors mayadversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business. As a result, disruptions in those areasmay adversely impact our earnings in that business unit. CreditRatings Our credit ratings directly affect the availability and costof our unsecured funding. FHN and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings.A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating ofBaa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for manypurposes. At January 31, 2019, both rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of FHN and of the Bank as investment grade. The ratings outlook was stable from Moody’s and from Fitch for both FHN and the Bank.  To the extentthat in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reducedliquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratingswere lowered further, particularly if lowered below investmentgrade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adverselyaffect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a creditrating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should beevaluated independently of any other rating. Reductions in our credit ratings could result in counterpartiesreducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restrictingthe business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certainthreshold.30Reductions in our credit ratings could allow counterparties toterminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateralwith respect to certain derivatives agreements. At this time, those of our ISDA master agreements which haveratings triggers reference the lower ofStandard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC or Moody’s ratings.  Based on those ratings, for sometime we have been required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with mostderivative counterparties. If a credit rating downgrade had occurred as of December 31, 2018, the maximum additionalcollateral we would have been required to post would have been approximately $1 million. InterestRate and Yield Curve Risks We are subject to interest rate risk because a significant portionof our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. A significant portion of ourfunding comes from short-term and demand deposits, while a significant portion of our lending and investing is in medium-term andlong-term instruments. Changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and could expand or compress our netinterest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought aboutby ordinary fluctuations in rates. A flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interest marginand adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable toshort and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-termrates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yieldcurve usually is upwardly sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted (sloped downward). A flat orinverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends toreduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business. We appear to be in a transitional period in terms of interestrate policy; the uncertainties of the direction, magnitude, and timing of future rate actions could adversely affect us. TheFederal Reserve raised short-term rates by 0.25% four times in 2018 following similar, but less frequent, raises starting in 2015.These actions have flattened the yield curve as short-term rates rose somewhat faster than long-term ones. Early in 2019 the FederalReserve signaled the possibility that 2019 could represent a pause in rate changes while economic trends are evaluated. If ratesin fact remain stable, the yield curve eventually may steepen, which should benefit us; however, in the meantime, various effectson us have been and may remain uneven for some time. Moreover, marketparticipants appear to be uncertain regarding the directionand timing of the Federal Reserve’s rate actions for 2019 and 2020. Uncertainty tends to increase market volatility and couldimpede borrowing or other capital decisions by customers. Market-indexed deposit products are very sensitive to changesin short-term rates, and our use of them increases our exposure to such changes. Expectations by the market regarding the direction of futureinterest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed incomebusiness. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, orwhen expectations are especially weak or uncertain. Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect ourbusiness. In 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates the London InterBankOffered Rate (LIBOR), announced that it intends to halt persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBORafter 2021. As a result, LIBOR as currently operated may not continue after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to whatextent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBORmay be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, little consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptedalternatives to LIBOR. One leading alternative rate, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) published by the Federal ReserveBank of New York, is not directly comparable to LIBOR and cannot easily or simply be substituted for it in outstanding instruments.Key differences between the two are: SOFR is based on secured lending, LIBOR is not; and SOFR is limited to overnight lending,while LIBOR encompasses several short-term maturity periods. It is impossible to predict the effect of any alternatives on thevalue of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans. Our primary exposures to31LIBOR are in variable-rate loans and in hedging transactions. Thelack of a leading alternative to LIBOR means that LIBOR continues to be used in many new instruments. In addition, it is not knownhow a transition away from LIBOR, or to a new version of LIBOR, will impact our ability to use hedge accounting after 2021.A few instruments issued by us, including a seriesof preferred stock issued by the Bank, have floating rate terms based on LIBOR. As mentioned above, it is not knownwhether LIBOR will continue after 2021 in a legally workable form. We have risk that an adverse outcome of the LIBORtransition after 2021 could increase our interest, dividend, and other costs relative to those instruments. We may not beable to refinance those instruments on terms that reduce those costs to the level we would have expected if LIBOR were tocontinue indefinitely, unchanged. Additionally, a transition from LIBOR could adversely impact or change our hedgeaccounting practices. AssetInventories and Market Risks The trading securities inventories and loans held for sale inour fixed income business are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securitiesinventory and loan positions for purposes of distribution to customers, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributableprincipally to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with those assets. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securitiesand loans through certain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk(“VaR”) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. Average fixed income trading securities (long positions)were $1.6 billion for 2018, $1.2 billion for 2017, and $1.2 billion for 2016. Average fixed income trading liabilities(short positions) were $.7 billion, $.7 billion, and $.8 billion for 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Average loans heldfor sale in our fixed income business were $.6 billion and $.3 billion for 2018 and 2017, and were insignificant for earlieryears. Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1Aby this reference, appears under the caption “Market Risk Management” beginning on page 49 of the Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2018 Annual Report, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or marketprices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokerage businessand our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adverselyaffect those revenue sources. Significant changes to the securities market’sperformance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assetsand obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in marketperformance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results.An example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pensionplan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimatesof benefits claims, the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims, and estimates of plan asset values.Our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors. Accordingly, our obligations diminishif the plan’s investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance, andcan grow if those investments perform poorly or if expectations worsen. A rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impactthe values of fixed income assets held in the plan, but could also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure thepresent value of future benefit payments. Similarly, our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarialinputs. We manage the risk of rate changes by investing plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities aligned with theexpected timing of payouts. Because there are no new participants, the actuarial-input risk should slowly diminish over time. Changes in our funding obligation generally translate into positiveor negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Our obligations and expensesrelative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employee population and changesto the plan itself. Although we have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some levelof volatility is unavoidable. Our hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequatelyhedge our risks, and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or fulleconomic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. For example:32our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on a portion ofits trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; and, we use derivatives, including swaps, swaptions,caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rates change. Generally,in the latter example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans.Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that theother party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk thatthe hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failurecould have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Accounting & Tax Risks The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformitywith U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financialstatements.  The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for credit losses.However, other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length. Currently those include:the level of reserves for loan repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure losses; the valuation (or impairment)of our deferred tax assets; and the valuation of our goodwill. Estimates are made at specific points in time. As actual eventsunfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time inthe future, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higherthan the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwill or other assets, or wemay make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especiallyconcerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, often we are unable to make estimatesuntil fairly late in a lengthy process. We lack first-hand visibility regarding certain loans, otherassets, or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. For example, interagency supervisoryguidance related to practices for loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties requiresthat the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessing the collectability and inherent loss of a performingjunior lien. Additionally, the OCC has clarified that an institution’s income recognition policy should incorporate management’sconsideration of all reasonably available information including, for junior liens, the performance of the associated senior liensas well as trends in other credit quality indicators. We own and service a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composedof home equity lines and installment loans. As of December 31, 2018, that amount was $6.2 billion. As of December 31,2018,approximately $1.1 billion, or 17%, of the consumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone secondliens while $.2 billion, or 3%, were second liens whose first liens are owned or serviced by FHN. We are not able toactively monitor the performance status of the first liens that are serviced by others. We obtain first lien performance informationfrom third parties and through loss mitigation activities, and we place a stand-alone second lien loan on nonaccrual if we discoverthat there are performance issues with the first lien loan. It is possible that if our evaluation methods change or informationsources otherwise improve our additions to nonperforming loans may be material. Changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we recordand report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companies in agiven industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operationsof companies within the same industry. One such pending accounting change, ASU 2016-13, “Measurementof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” substantially revises the measurement and recognition of credit losses for certainassets, including most loans, in a manner that could substantially and adversely change when and how we recognize loan loss.Under ASU 2016-13, when we make a new loan that is covered by the standard, we will be required to recognize immediately the “currentexpected credit loss,” or “CECL,” of that loan. We will also re-evaluate CECL each quarter that the loan is outstanding.CECL is the difference between our cost and the net amount we expect to collect over the life of the loan using certain estimationmethods and our experience with other, similar loans. In contrast, the current accounting standard delays recognition of creditloss until loss is “probable” (very likely). We expect to adopt ASU 2016-13 and CECL accounting in 2020, though theimpact on regulatory capital will have a short phase-in period. Once ASU 2016-13 and the CECL accounting process is fully in place,recognition of estimated credit loss will be significantly accelerated compared to current practice.33This change potentially could: result in a significant increase,especially at the time of adoption but also during any period of loan growth, in our loan loss provision (expense) and allowance(reserve); through the increased provision, adversely impact our earnings and, correspondingly, our regulatory capital levels;and enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year, especially duringtimes when the economy is in transition. Moreover, CECL creates an incentive for banks to reduce new lending in the “down”part of the economic cycle in order to reduce loss recognition. That perverse incentive could, nationwide, prolong the down cycleand delay a recovery. Changes in regulatory rules can create significant accountingimpacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accountingstandards. Changes in those standards can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, suchchanges can impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties inour financial reporting. Our Controls and Procedures May Fail or Be Circumvented.Internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and corporate governance policies and procedures (“controls and procedures”)must be effective in order to provide assurance that financial reports are materially accurate. A failure or circumvention of ourcontrols and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Risksof Holding Our Stock  The principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock,as well as service our debt, is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank may be unable to pay dividends to us withoutregulatory approval. We primarily depend upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our commonand preferred stockholders, and to service our outstanding debt. Regulatory constraints might prevent the Bank from declaring andpaying dividends to us in 2019 without regulatory approval. Applying the applicable regulatory rules, at January 1, 2019, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank’s commonor preferred stock of approximately $156.2 million without obtaining regulatory approval. That amount will improveduring 2019 only to the extent that the Bank’s earnings for the year exceed preferred and any common dividends for the year.Also, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank.Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable fordividends. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policystatements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings.The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general mattera bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) thebank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paidduring that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company’s prospective rateof earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financialcondition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capitaladequacy ratios.34Our stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capitalthrough public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. Ifwe raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownershipof our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to thoseof our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders.We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutive to stockholders.Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charterand bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging athird party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquireus even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders. In addition, federal banking laws prohibitnon-financial-industry companies from owning a bank, and require regulatory approval of any change in control of a bank.  "

The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,”“should,” “is likely,” “will,” “going forward,” and other expressions that indicatefuture events and trends identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimatesand assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies,many of which are beyond our control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions and actions(including acquisitionsand divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: global,general, and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; the stability or volatility ofvalues and activity in the residential housing and commercial real estate markets; potential requirements for us to repurchase,or compensate for losses from, previously sold or securitized mortgages or securities based on such mortgages; potential claimsalleging mortgage servicing failures, individually, on a class basis, or as master servicer of securitized loans; potential claimsrelating to participation in government programs, especially lending or other financial services programs; expectations of andactual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significantimpact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage 17markets; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, competitor,regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties;competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity;natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedging practices; technological changes; fraud, theft, or other incursionsthrough conventional, electronic, or other means affecting us directly or affecting our customers, business counterparties, orcompetitors; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; the increasinguse of new technologies to interact with customers and others; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherentin originating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuationin U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally,the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of theComptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the U.S. Department of theTreasury (Treasury),the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Financial Stability OversightCouncil (Council), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and other regulators and agencies; pending, threatened,or possible future regulatory, administrative, and judicial outcomes, actions, and proceedings; current or future Executive orders;changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing therisks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-lookingstatements. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-lookingstatements that are made in this report on Form 10-K, in our 2017 Annual Report, or in any other statement, release, report, orfiling from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change, possibly materially, because of one or morefactors, including those factors listed above or presented below, in other Items of this report, or in material incorporated byreference into this report. Readers of this report, including our 2017 Annual Report, should carefully consider the factors discussedin this Item 1A below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. CompetitionRisks  We are subject to intense competition for customers, andthe nature of that competition is changing quickly. Our primary areas of competition for customers include: consumerand commercial deposits, commercial loans, consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, financial planning andwealth management, fixed income products and services, and other consumer and commercial financial products and services. Our competitorsin these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies,trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securitiesfirms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies (traditional and otherwise) that serve themarkets which we serve. Some competitors are traditional banks, subject to the sameregulatory framework as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degreeof regulation. Long-standing examples of less-regulated activity include check-cashing and independent ATM services. Arecent exampleof unregulated activity is so-called “peer-to-peer” lending, where investors provide debt capital directly to borrowers. Through technological innovations and changes in customer habits,the manner in which customers use financial services is changing. We provide a large number of services remotely (desktop, online,or mobile), and physical branch utilization has been in long-term decline throughout the industry for many years. Technology hashelped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has allowed disruptors to enter traditional banking areas. Some traditionalconsumer banking services are largely provided through retailers, especially grocery stores and so-called super-stores which customersvisit frequently. Companies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse) and Starbucks (a large chain of cafes) providepayment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible until recent times. Also, the nature of technology-driven competition is startingto change. A number of recent technologies 18have worked with the existing financial system and traditionalbanks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. Thesesorts of technologies often have expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues fromthose services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of delivering those services.But some recent innovations may tend to replace traditional banks as financial service providers rather than merely augment those services For example, companies which claim to offer applicationsand services based on artificial intelligence are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companiesin areas involving personal advice, including high-margin services such as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost,high-speed nature of these “robo-advisor” services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent customersand potential customers. Similarly, crypto-currencies and other inventions based on blockchain technology eventually maybe the foundation for greatly enhancingtransactional security throughout the bankingindustry, but also may eventually greatly reducethe need for banks as financial deposit-keepersand intermediaries.We expect that competition will continue to grow more intensewith respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affecteditems, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition forcustomers, refer to the “Competition” heading of Item 1 beginning on page 14 of this report. We compete for talent. Our most significant competitorsfor customers also are our most significant competitors for top talent. See “Operational Risks” beginning on page 25of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk. We compete to raise capital in the equityand debt markets. See “Liquidity and Funding Risks” beginning on page 29 of this Item 1A for additional informationconcerning this risk. Riskfrom Economic Downturns and Changes  Generally in an economic downturn our credit losses increase,demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and creditlosses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressureon collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financialservices may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economicfactors that impact demand for loans andother financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in employmentrates, interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or otheradverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses,lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin, and lower fees from transactions andservices. Those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends. RisksAssociated with Monetary Events  The Federal Reserve has implemented significant economicstrategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve, and currently is transitioningfrom many years of easing to what may be an uneven, but extended, period of tightening. In recent years, in response to therecession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives.Several of these have emphasized so-called quantitative easing strategies, the most recent of which ended during 2014. Since thenthe Federal Reserve raised rates five times during 2015-2017, in each case by a modest 25 basis points. Further rate changes reportedlyare dependent on the Federal Reserve’s assessment of economic data as it becomes available. This data-dependent process,now in its fourth year, may represent a fitful transition to a tightening trend, or it may represent merely aninterim period duringwhich rates have little clear up or down long-term trend. Federal Reserve strategies can, and often are intended to,affect the domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve oftenare most pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things,easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economicactivity, while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply,and restrain economic activity. Other things being equal, a transition from easing to tightening should tend to diminish or reversedownward pressure on rates, and to diminish or end the stimulus effect that low rates tend to have on the economy. Many external 19factors may interfere with the effects of these plans or causethem to be changed unexpectedly. Such factors include significant economic trends or events as well as significant internationalmonetary policies and events. An example of the former is the substantial drop in oil prices experienced during 2015 and the firsthalf of 2016. An example of the latter is the July 2016 United Kingdom referendum calling for the U.K. to leave the European Union.Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict. For example,recent tightening by the Federal Reserve has at times flattened, rather than steepened, the yield curve due in part to high non-USdemand for US-dollar fixed income securities. Risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item1A under the caption “Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks” beginning on page 31. We may be adversely affected by economic and political situationsoutside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our customers, are linked significantly to economic and marketconditions outside the U.S., especially in North America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in Centraland South America. Althoughwe have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or non-US sovereign debt, in the future major adverse eventsoutside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impactinclude (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default,(iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapse of governments, alliances,or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadlyinclude the following: an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailability of borrowed funds throughconventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our customers; impacts upon the U.S. economy,especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts uponus from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to majorfinancial disruptions. Strategicand Macro Risks  We may be unable to successfully implement our strategy togrow our consumer and commercial banking businesses and our fixed income business. In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategyin response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions. In 2008 we sold our national mortgage platforms and closedour national lending operations. Since then we have closed a number of other units and sold loans and servicing assets, furtherreducing our exposure to legacy operations. More importantly, we renewed our emphasis on traditional banking and fixed income productsand services. Although our current strategy is expected to evolve as businessconditions continue to change, at present our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking and fixed income businesses.Growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. In the past three years we havecreated a mix of organic growth, several tactical acquisitions, and a strategic acquisition (Capital Bank). Organically, we have enhanced our market share in our traditionalbanking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into other southeast U.S. markets with similar characteristics, andexpanded with commercial lending and private client banking in the Houston, Texas market. We have made similar moves in our fixedincome business.Our acquisitions in the past three years have included two banks,commercial loan portfolios, a commercial loan placement and servicing business, and a fixed income firm specializing in governmentguaranteed loans. The Capital Bank transaction late in 2017 re-introduced us to the consumer mortgage business, though that businessis much more modest than the ‘national’ mortgage businesses we exited in 2008. In the future, we expect to pursue acquisitions if appropriateopportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves, and we expect to continue to nurture profitable organicgrowth as well. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including: ●our ability to attract and retain customers in our banking market areas; ●our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities; ●in our fixed income business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same timeidentifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers; 20●our ability to maintain a high level of customer service while reducing our physical branch count due to changing customerdemand, all while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information processing, technology, compliance,and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; ●our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-fundedacquisitions; and ●our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex, burdensome, and evolvingregulatory environment. We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elementsthat are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, asconditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions,we face various additional risks, including: ●our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisitionand to price the transaction appropriately; ●our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively; ●our ability to manage any operational or cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions; ●our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own;  ●our ability to retain core customers and key employees of the acquired company; and, ●under current laws, the prospect of substantially increased regulatory burdens and costs if we exceed $50billion in asset size. A type of strategic acquisition—a so-called “mergerof equals” where the company we nominally acquire has similar size, operating contribution, or value—presents uniqueopportunities but also unique risks. Those special risks include: ●the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies efficiently ina reasonable amount of time; and, ●a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before any substantial economies of scale are realized. Just as disruptive business changes driven by new technologies and new customerpreferences can adversely impact us and our entire industry, similar events canadversely impact our commercial customers. In time, a major business disruption cancause long-standing or dominant businesses to fail, and can shrink or even end entire linesof business. An example of this is the business failure of the Blockbuster video distributionchain and most other video distribution stores, and the rise of Netflix. Many otherexamples of this kind of process are ongoing today in many industries, includingpublishing, retail sales, news, and the creation as well as distribution of audio and videoentertainment. To the extent disruptions impact our customers, we may experience elevatedloan losses and loss of ongoing business which we may not be able to recapture with newcommercial customers. RisksRelated to Businesses We May Exit  We may be unable to successfully implement a dispositionof businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adaptto a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include: ●our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms; ●our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition   actions to avoid or minimize negativeeffects on retained businesses;   ●our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and ●our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in significant legacy cashexpenditures or financial loss. LegacyMortgage Business Risks  We have risks from the mortgage-related businesses we exited,including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, claims of non-compliancewith contractual and regulatory requirements, and the risk of higher default rates on loans made by our former businesses. In2008 we exited our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses. However, we still retain as assets a significantamount of loans that those businesses created. Most of thoseloans are secured by residential or other real estate situated acrossthe U.S. We retain the risk of liability to customers and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating thosebusinesses. These legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include: ●We experienced elevated losses related to claims that we did not comply with contractual or other legal requirements when wesold mortgage loans. 21Losses may continue, irregularly. Although our expensesrelated to these matters have declined substantially, and in recent years we have experienced reserve releases, new informationcould be received in the future resulting in adverse adjustments related to exposures. Our total repurchase and foreclosure provisionexpense was $170.0 million for 2013, negative $4.3 million for 2014, zero for 2015, negative $32.7 million for 2016, and negative$22.5 million for 2017. ●We are defending litigation matters associated with claims arising out of our former mortgage securitization activities. Theoutcome of those matters is uncertain; losses in excess of current accruals (reserves) could be material. ●The trustee for those securitizations could demand repurchase of loans placed into securitizations or make-whole damages ifwe breached contractual requirements or obligations, or could demand that we indemnify the trustee if the trustee is sued. We havereceived one such indemnity demand, for expenses. ●We have responded to investigations and inquiries by various parties, including government agencies, related to mortgage loanswe originated. Inquiries have been wide ranging. A few have led to litigation. One investigation, involving the FHA insurance program,led to a settlement of $212.5 million in 2015. ●We could be subject to claims that servicing-related actions were done improperly, or improperly were not done. Although we may be able to demandindemnity in cases where servicing was performed on our behalf by another institution, there is risk that such an indemnity demandcould be refused by the institution or rejected by an appropriate court. Other trends adverse to us may emerge from this legacy business.Additional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them, all of which is incorporatedinto this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,and Other Contractual Obligations” beginning on page 61, “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning onpage 65, and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 68 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the captions “Material Matters” and “Obligationsfrom Legacy Mortgage Businesses” beginning on pages 141 and 142, respectively, which is part of the material from our2017Annual Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. We have exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligationsand assets which we retained after we generally sold our mortgage businesses in 2008, especially in relation to the subservicingarrangements we made between 2008 and the sale of substantially all our remaining servicing assets completed in 2014. Whenwe sold our origination and servicing businesses in 2008 we retained significant servicing obligations and assets. At that timewe engaged as our subservicer the purchaser of our business. In 2011 that engagement expired and we engaged a new subservicer.Our 2008 subservicer experienced significant losses in connection with its servicing business. Our 2008 subservicer has informedus that it expects us to reimburse it for a significant portion of its losses and costs under our subservicing agreement. We disagreewith our 2008 subservicer’s position and have made no reimbursements. We also believe that certain amounts billed us by agenciesfor penalties and curtailments of claims by the subservicer prior to the 2011 subservicing transfer but billed after that dateare owed by the subservicer. This disagreement has the potential to result in litigation and, in any such future litigation, theclaim against us may be substantial. In addition, our 2011 subservicer has asserted several categoriesof contractual indemnity obligations under agreements we have with that subservicer. Although no litigation is pending, this matterhas the potential to result in a substantial claim against us. Additional information concerning risks related to former servicingand foreclosure practices and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is setforth: under the captions “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 65, “Foreclosure Practices”beginning on page 67, and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 68 of the Management’s Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the captions “Servicing Obligations”and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” in Note 17—Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on pages143 and 144, respectively, of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporatedby reference into Item 8 of this report. Several large purchasers of mortgage-backed securities havefiled suits against the trustees for those securitizations asserting various theories of liability. The trustee of our securitizationsis defending 22such matters, and many of our securitizations are among thosealleged to have been purchased by the plaintiffs. The claims for damages are based in part on allegations that the trustee didnot properly or timely act against the originators of the securitizations or the servicers of the loans, and further assert thatthe trustee has affirmative duties to act which were not set forth inthe legal trust documents. Some of the legal theories advancedare untested or unsettled. Although we are not a defendant in these proceedings, these complex suits may progress or evolve soas to compel us to defend ourselves or our trustee, and could create financial exposure for us. ReputationRisks  Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtainand retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and financial stability. Ourreputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practicesare perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole,also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationshipsmay adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management.Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to accessthe capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones,could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our abilityto attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry,may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrainour business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk. CreditRisks  We face the risk that our customers may not repay their loansand that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that other counterparties,in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit charge-offsis unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary substantially over time. To take the most recent example, netcharge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007, and increased to $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginningin 2010, net charge-offs began to decline, reaching $31.2 million in 2015, $19.2 million in 2016, and $12.5 millionin 2017. In recent years, our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels. The allowance for loan loss was $189.6 millionas of December 31, 2017, down substantially from $896.9 million and $849.2 million at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon ourability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including realestate, among other things. We further manage lending credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity,by following per-relationship lending limits, and by recording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentionedabove and in accordance with applicable accounting rules.We further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways,some of which are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having toomuch risk concentrated with any single counterparty. We record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting andregulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption “Accounting & Tax Risks” beginningon page 32, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to increase, or to be recognizedon an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC or PCAOBcould take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the Federal Reserve,OCC, or other banking regulators. A significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and othermodels and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment,in real estate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, basedon our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon ourreported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending 23businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are notconsistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could be misguided or otherwise affected with substantialadverse consequences to us. A significant subset of our home equity lines of credit wereoriginated prior to our mortgage platform sale in 2008. A large number of those loans recently have been and (through 2018) willbe switching from interest-only payments to full amortization payments of principal and interest combined. In reserving for potentialloss in this portfolio we model an increased rate of default associated with the higher monthly payment requirements when thatswitch occurs. Our modeling is based, among other things, on our experience with this portfolio, but risk remains that actual defaultrates could exceed our modeling. The low-interest rate environment has elevated the traditionalchallenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income or yield. This challengeapplies not only to credit risk in lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding investments. As interest rates rise, default risk also rises. As borrowers’obligations to pay interest increase, financial weaknesses become more evident. Initially this will result in lower consumer creditscores and lower commercial loan grading, and eventually will result in higher default rates. The composition of our loan portfolio inherently increasesour sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2017, approximately 58% of total loans consisted of the commercial,financial, and industrial (C&I) category, while approximately 23% consisted of the consumer real estate category. The largest component of the C&I category at year end wasloans to finance and insurance companies, a component which represented about 18% of the C&I category at that time. Thesecond largest component was loans to mortgage companies. As a result, approximately 31% of the C&I category was sensitiveto impacts on the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financialservices industry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in realestate and other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions, than many other industries. Negative impacts on theindustry could dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio. The consumer real estate category contains a number of concentrationswhich affect credit risk assessment of the category.●Product concentration. The consumer real estate category consists primarily of consumer installment loans, and muchof the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit. ●Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 24% of thecategory consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis. ●Geographic concentration. At year end about 51% of the category related to Tennessee customers, 16% related to North Carolina, 13% related to Florida, 4% relatedto California, and no other state represented more than 3% of the category. ●Legacy concentration. We still have more than $1 billion of loans originated before 2009 byour legacy national mortgage lending business. Those include loans we originated and did not sell, along with loans we have repurchasedin the course of resolving claims with loan buyers. Our legacy loan portfolio continues to shrink, but the rate of shrinkageis slowing. The consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economicimpacts on consumer customers and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significantlife events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, in the currentenvironment regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer categoryand our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types. Our exposure to the volatile oil & gas industry is modestbut growing. Our Houston office specializes in commercial lending, which in that office significantly focuses on three areas:energy, commercial real estate (CRE), and commercial, financial, & industrial (C&I). Much of our Houston business is connected,at least in part, to the energy industry, especially oil and gas production and distribution. In addition to general credit andother risks mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, the energy business and related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specificto that industry. Key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. The shiftingbalance between demand and supply is expressed most simply in prices. Although the financial impact from recent oil-price volatilityon our overall loan business was relatively modest, we did experience elevated charge-offs. The impact was moderate in part becausewe did not have a substantial portfolio in the industry before prices started to fall. Going forward, volatility in oil pricescould impact our financial performance and growth of our Houston-based lending business. 24Additional information concerning credit risks andour management of them is set forth under the captions “Asset Quality” beginning on page 31, “CommercialLoan Portfolios” beginning on page 31, “Consumer Loan Portfolios” beginning on page 38, “Credit RiskManagement” beginning on page 57, and “Allowance for Loan Losses” beginning on page 67 of theManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 AnnualReport, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. OperationalRisks  Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependentin part upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure,manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arisein many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes;faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and relatedsecurity breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequaciesmay present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, informationtechnology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, malware, or other major casualty, and they maybe insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also makethem less adaptable. Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challengesas we strive to maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost. A serious information technology security (cybersecurity)breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, thatdamage can occur due to outright theft or extortion of our funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers, or adversepublicity associated with a breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certainvendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Becauseof the potentially very serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to addressinternal and external security concerns to a high degree, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulationspertaining to bank safety and customer protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others aremuch older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated withfraud, theft,and other electronic crimes, and we educate our customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications.We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue toevolve. The operational functions we outsource to third parties mayexperience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limitedability to obtain quickly an alternate vendor. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operationalfunctions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult. The operational functions of business counterparties mayexperience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in recentyears several major U.S. retailers, a major electronic mail provider, and a major credit reporting firm all experienced data systemsincursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other dataof millions of customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including ourBank. Although our systems are not breached in retailer incursions, these events can increase account fraud and can cause us toreissue a significant number of account cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our customers.Our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations. Other possible points of incursion ordisruption not within our control include internet service providers, social media portals, distant-server (“cloud”)service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers. Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure,failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructurecomponents suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable regulatorystandards. Additional information concerning 25operational risks and our management of them, all of which isincorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “Operational Risk Management” beginningon page 56 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. The delivery of financial services to customers and othersincreasingly depends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risksdiscussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untestedtechnologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectualproperty infringement. Competition for talent is substantial and increasing. Moreover,revenue growth in some business lines increasingly depends upon top talent. In the past three years the cost to us of hiringand retaining toprevenue-producing talent has increased, and that trend is likely to continue. The primary tools we use to attractand retain talent are: salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in controlseverance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these toolseffectively, we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively. Incentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverseeffects. Incentive programs are difficult to design well, and even if well-designed often they must be updated to address changesin our business. A poorly designed incentive program—where goals are too difficult, too easy, or not well related to desiredoutcomes—could provide little useful motivation to key employees, could increase turnover, and could impact customer retention.Moreover, even where those pitfalls are avoided, incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences. For example, aprogram focused entirely on revenue production, without proper controls, may result in costs growing faster than revenues. ServiceRisks  We provide a wide range of servicesto customers, and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we providedthem in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Ourservices include lending, loan servicing, fiduciary, custodial, depositary, funds management, insurance, and advisory services,among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Additionalinformation concerning these risks and our management ofthem, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captions “Operational RiskManagement” and “Compliance Risk Management,” beginning on pages 56 and 57, respectively, of theManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 AnnualReport, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of thisreport. Regulatory,Legislative, and Legal Risks  The regulatory environment is challenging. We operatein a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environment changed significantly as a result of Dodd-Frank. Our regulatory burdens,including both operating restrictions and ongoing compliance costs, are substantial. We are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securitiesbrokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly tradedin the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulationscould result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations mayincrease our costsand/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See “Supervision and Regulation”in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 6, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal andstate regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition,we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areasof employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changingthese regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could furtherrestrict our ability to collect loans or realize on 26collateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the productsand services we offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulationsalso could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share orreceive customer information and increasing our costs. The following paragraphs highlight certain specific importantrisk areas related to regulatory matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do notdescribe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstanceschange. We and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatorycapital levels and ratios. In 2013 regulators adopted enhancements to U.S. capital standards based on international standardsknown as “Basel III.” They are discussed in Item 1 of this report, in tabular and narrative form, under the caption“Capital Adequacy” starting on page 8. Pressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and addressbusiness needs in the current economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders. Suchactions could include: reduction or elimination of dividends; the issuance of common or preferred stock, or securities convertibleinto stock; or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classesof common or preferred stock. Additional information concerning these risks and our managementof them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions “Capital Adequacy”and “Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)” in Item 1 of this report beginning on pages 8 and 9, respectively; under the captions“Capital—2017 Compared to 2016,” “Capital Management and Adequacy,” and “Market Uncertaintiesand Prospective Trends” beginning on pages 26, 56, and 66, respectively, of the Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption “Regulatory Capital” in Note12—Regulatory Capital and Restrictions, beginning on page 131 of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material fromthat report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. We are required to conduct and submit annual stress tests,the outcomes of which could further increase our capital requirements and coulddamage our reputation and our ability to obtaincredit. Stress testing processes require banks to estimate the impact on capital, liquidity, and other measures of safety ofcertain assumed environmental shocks. A failure to satisfy regulatory stress testing, or another significant risk management standard,could result in the imposition of operating restrictions on us and require us to raise capital, which could adversely affect operatingresults or be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, a summary of a portion of the stress results must be made public. A poorresult could impact our reputation generally and our ability to borrow funds. Stress-testing may create unintended adverse incentives whichmay promote counter-productive tactics. Stress testing includes “rate shocks” which model the financial impactof sudden large increases in market interest rates upon us. In practical effect this encourages banks to shorten the “duration”of their assets (loans and investments), discouraging long-term assets. Shortening duration should improve a bank’s abilityto withstand a very large rate shock. However, it also can reduce the effective yield a bank receives from its assets, which wouldput downward pressure on revenues, margins, and earnings. Legal disputes are an unavoidable part of business, and theoutcome of pending or threatened litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty. We face the risk of litigation from customers,employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators.We manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethicsprocesses, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled withany certainty. Typically we are unable to estimate our loss exposure fromclaims against us until relatively late in the litigation process, which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigationunpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next. Currently we are defending a number of legal matters. For mostof them we have established either no accrual (reserve) or no significant reserve. Financial accounting guidance requires thatlitigation loss be both estimable and probable before a reserve may be established (recorded as a liability on our balance sheet).For most litigation matters, under that guidance reserves typically are not established until after preliminary motions to dismissor narrow the case are resolved, after discovery is substantially in process, and (in many cases) after preliminary overtures regardingsettlement have occurred. Potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserveis established. Moreover, it is 27not uncommon for a case to experience relatively little progresstoward resolution for a long period followed by a brief period of rapid development. Lastly, although most cases are resolved withlittle or no loss to us, for the others loss typically is recognized either all at once (near the time of resolution) or very unevenlyover the life of the case. Additional information concerning litigation risks and our managementof them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the caption “Legacy Mortgage BusinessRisks” beginning on page 21 of this report; under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance SheetArrangements,and Other Contractual Obligations,” “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability,” “Market Uncertainties and ProspectiveTrends,” and “Contingent Liabilities” beginning on pages 61, 65, 66, and 70, respectively, of the Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of thematerial from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption “Contingencies”in Note 17—Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 140 of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Risksof Expense Control  Our ability to successfully manage expenses is importantto our long-term survival and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence theamount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additionalexpenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, amongother things. The importance of managing expenses has been amplified in the recent slow growth, low net interest margin businessenvironment. In the past five years our noninterestexpense generally has grown less quickly than our assets and revenues. However, noninterest expense has been made more volatileyear-to-year, and especially quarter-to-quarter, by idiosyncratic charges related to legacy mortgage activities as discussed inthis Item 1A under the caption “Legacy Mortgage Business Risks” beginning on page 21. Noninterest expense in 2017 deviatedfrom our recent trend, primarily due to expenses related to strategic acquisitions and tax reform legislation. We manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety ofmeans, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recentyears we have actively sought to make strategic businesses moreefficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking andright-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usuallyentail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs,and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future. We have also re-focused our attention on the economic profitgenerated by our business activities and prospects rather than merely revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attemptsto relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returnson capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The processis intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment of our resources. Economic profit analysis involves significant judgmentregarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitabilityover the long run. Despite our efforts, our costs could rise due to adverse structuralchanges or market shifts. For example, the overall cost of our health insurance benefit is highly dependent upon regulatory factorsand market forces beyond our control. GeographicRisks  We are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions.To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarilyimpact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If the southeastern U.S. were to experienceadversity not shared by other partsof the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by those competitorswhich have a broader or different regional footprint. Examples of these kinds of risks include: earthquakes in Memphis; hurricanesin south Florida or coastal Texas; a major change in health insurance laws impacting the many 28healthcare companies in middle Tennessee; and automotive industryplant closures. We have international assets in the form of loans and lettersof credit. Holding non-U.S. assets creates a number of risks: the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers andconstraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk that currency exchangerates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollarvalue of liabilities;and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our ability to manage thoseand other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in legal, cultural,and other expectations applicable to customers, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; and our abilityto recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed. Insurance  Our property and casualty insurance may not cover or maybe inadequate to cover the risks that we face, and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by the insurers that provideus mortgage and bank-owned life insurance. We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction ofproperty as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance maybe inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risksthat the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a typeof credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical.The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation. A portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage defaultinsurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adverselyaffect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provisionor write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financialresults. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades orinsolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impactwould be amplified. We own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assetson our books. Some of those policies are “general account” and others are “separate account.” The generalaccount policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separateaccount policies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underliethose policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularlyfor the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantlylimited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon earlypolicy termination. When we self-insure certain exposures, our estimates of futureexpenditures may be inadequate for actual expenditures that occur. For example, we self-insure our employee health-insurancebenefit program. We estimate future expenditures and establish accruals (reserves) based on the estimates. If actual expenditureswere to exceed our estimates in a future period, our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased. Liquidityand Funding Risks  Liquidity is essential to our business model and a lack ofliquidity or an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financialconditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore,can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2017 were met principally by deposits, byfinancing fromother financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets. Deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable fundsand by far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. As the economy improvesand market rates rise, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly if a tipping point is reached, as depositorsbecome more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could 29pressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink ournet interest margin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly. The market among banks for deposits may be impacted by the BaselIII capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Moreover, institutions with more than $50billion of assets are required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. Larger banks covered by this rule may be incentedto compete for core deposits vigorously. Although mid-sized banks, like ours, are not directly impacted by this rule, if some largebanks in our markets take aggressive actions we could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust our deposit pricing and practicesin ways that could increase our costs. We also depend upon financing from private institutional orother investors by means of the capital markets. In 2014 we issued $400 million of senior Bank notes due 2019, and in 2015 we issued$500 million of senior holding-company notes due 2020. The 2015 notes refinanced an earlier five-year notes issue. Presently webelieve we could access the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may becomeunavailable to us for reasons beyond our control. A number of more general factors could make funding more difficult,more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or politicalchanges, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in theactivities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets,specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolioor other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions,general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. Inaddition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial marketsas well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may remain or become increasingly difficultdue to economic and other factors beyond our control. Uncertainties about the future of LIBOR and other benchmarkrates may impact our costs and our ability to manage our assets and liabilities to maintain our net interest margin. In 2017international proposals were made to change, or no longer officially use, certain benchmark interest rates to which many loansand securities are linked. We cannot predict how or when LIBOR and other benchmarks may change nor the impact such changes mayhave on us, our customers, or the market for our notes or preferred stock. Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factorsmay adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business. As a result, disruptions in thoseareas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit. CreditRatings  Our credit ratings directly affect the availability and costof our unsecured funding. FHN and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecured borrowings.A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating ofBaa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for manypurposes. At December 31, 2017, both rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of FHN and of the Bank as investment grade.The ratings outlook from Fitch was positive, and stable from Moody’s for both FHN and the Bank. To the extent that in thefuture we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidityand increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade.In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affectthe cost andavailability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a credit ratingis not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluatedindependently of any other rating. Reductions in our credit ratings could result in counterpartiesreducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restrictingthe business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold. Reductions in our credit ratings could allow counterpartiesto terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateralwith respect to certain derivatives agreements. At this time, those of our ISDA master agreements which have ratings triggersreference the lower of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC or 30Moody’s ratings. Based on those ratings, for some timewe have been required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties.Should a credit ratingdowngrade occur, the maximum additional collateral we would have been required to post is approximately$1 million as of December 31, 2017. InterestRate and Yield Curve Risks  We are subject to interest rate risk because a significantportion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. A significant portionof our funding comes from short-term and demand deposits, while a significant portion of our lending and investing is in medium-termand long-term instruments. Changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and could expand or compress ournet interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought aboutby ordinary fluctuations in rates. A flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interestmargin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicableto short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-termrates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yieldcurve usually is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted. A flat or inverted yield curvetends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-termdebt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business. We may be in a transitional period, from a low-rate environmentto one with more normal, or at least somewhat higher, rates. The yield curve eventually may steepen, though at least in the shortterm it has tended to flatten as short-term rates have risen somewhat faster than long-term ones. With higher rates and (eventually)a steeper yield curve, the new environment eventually should be positive for us, overall. However, some effects may be negativeand the timing of various effects will be uneven. Examples include: (i) rising rates may create transitorybut significantoutflows of deposits, which in turn could necessitate additional (and more costly) borrowing or raising deposit rates more quicklythan anticipated; (ii) rising rates are likely to dampen consumer demand for mortgages, which could quickly reduce demand for ourmortgage warehouse lending products; (iii) mortgage demand may change unevenly, with a brief uptick (to lock in still-low rates)followed by a more pronounced down-trend; and (iv) long-term rate changes may continue to lag short-term changes due to externalfactors such as high foreign demand for U.S. dollar fixed income securities. Although our overall balance sheet remains asset-sensitive,we have partially moderated that sensitivity, which would somewhat diminish the benefits we otherwise would realize from a generalrise in interest rates. Our asset-liability management has positioned our balance sheet to be “asset-sensitive.” Assuch, a general rise in rates should benefit us if, as we expect, the deposit and other rates we pay tend to rise more slowly thanthe rates we charge or receive on our assets. We believe an asset sensitive balance sheet remains appropriate. However, as short-termrates continue to rise from near zero, the risk of a future lowering of interest rates becomes more significant. The acquisition of Capital Bank has moderated our asset sensitivityslightly, which will somewhat diminish the benefits we otherwisewould have realized from a general rise in interest rates. We believean asset sensitive balance sheet remains appropriate, as we balancethe market’s expectations for further rate increases against ourexposure to, and the likelihood of, falling interest rates. Expectations by the market regarding the direction of futureinterest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed incomebusiness. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, orwhen expectations are especially weak or uncertain. AssetInventories and Market Risks  The trading securities inventories and loans held for salein our fixed income business are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securitiesinventory and loan positions for purposes of distribution to customers, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributableprincipallyto credit risk and interest rate risk associated with these assets. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securitiesand loans through certain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk(“VaR”) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. 31Average fixed income trading securities (long positions) were$1.2 billion for 2017, $1.2 billion for 2016, and $1.3 billion for 2015. Average fixed income trading liabilities (shortpositions) were $.8 billion, $.8 billion, $.7 billion for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Average loans held forsale in our fixed income business were $.3 billion for 2017, and were insignificant for earlier years. Additionalinformation concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference,appears under the caption “Market Risk Management” beginning on page 53 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2017 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in marketsor market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokeragebusiness and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market pricescan adversely affect those revenue sources. Significant changes to the securities market’s performancecan have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assets and obligationsthat are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a materialimpact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. An example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pensionplan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimatesof benefits claims, the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims, and estimates of plan asset values.Our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors. Accordingly, our obligations diminishif the plan’s investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance, andcan grow if thoseinvestments perform poorly or if expectations worsen. A rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impactthe values of fixed income assets held in the plan, but could also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure thepresent value of future benefit payments. Similarly, our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarialinputs. We manage the risk of rate changes by investing plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities aligned with theexpected timing of payouts. Because there are no new participants, the actuarial-input risk should diminish over time, althoughvery slowly. Changes in our funding obligation generally translate into positiveor negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Our obligations and expensesrelative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employee population and changesto the plan itself. Although we have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatilityis unavoidable. Our hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequatelyhedge our risks, and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or fulleconomic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. For example: our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on aportion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; and, we use derivatives, including swaps,swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rateschange. Generally, in the latter example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk thatthe other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the riskthat the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failurecould have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Accounting & Tax Risks  The preparation of our consolidated financial statementsin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affectthe financial statements. The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for creditlosses. However, other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or duringperiods of varying length. Currentlythose include: the level of reserves for loan repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure losses; the valuation of our deferred taxassets; and the valuation of our goodwill. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates areadjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantlyincrease the 32allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses thatare significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwillor other assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover,in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, we areunable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process. We lack first-hand visibility regarding certainloans, other assets, or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. For example,interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 familyresidential properties requires that the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessing the collectabilityand inherent loss of a performing junior lien. Additionally, the OCC has clarified that an institution’s incomerecognition policy should incorporate management’s consideration of all reasonably available information including, forjunior liens, the performance of the associated senior liens as well as trends in other credit quality indicators. We ownand service a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. Asof December 31, 2017, that amount was $6.4 billion. As of December 31, 2017, approximately $1.4 billion, or 21%, of theconsumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone second liens while $.2 billion, or 3%, were second liens whose firstliens are owned or serviced by FHN. We are not able to actively monitor the performance status of the first liens that areserviced by others. We obtain first lien performance information from third parties and through loss mitigation activities,and we place a stand-alone second lien loan on nonaccrual if we discover that there are performance issues with the firstlien loan. It is possible that if our evaluation methods change or information sources otherwise improve our additions tononperforming loans may be material. Changes in accounting rules can significantly affect howwe record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companiesin a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or businessoperations of companies within the same industry. One such pending accounting change, ASU 2016-13, “Measurementof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,” substantially revises the measurement and recognition of credit losses for certainassets, including most loans, in a manner that could substantially and adversely change when and how we recognize loan loss.Under ASU 2016-13, when we make a new loan that is covered by the standard, we will be required to recognize immediately the“current expected credit loss,” or “CECL,” of that loan. We will also re-evaluate CECL each quarterthe loan is outstanding. CECL is the difference between our cost and the net amount we expect to collect over the life of theloan using certain estimation methods and our experience with other, similar loans. In contrast, the current accountingstandard delays recognition of credit loss until loss is “probable” (very likely). As a result, once we adopt ASU2016-13 and the CECL accounting process (expected for 2020), recognition of estimated credit loss will be significantlyaccelerated compared to current practice. This change potentially could: result in a significant increase, especially at thetime of adoption but also during any period of loan growth, in our loan loss provision (expense) and allowance (reserve);through the increased provision, adversely impact our earnings and, correspondingly, our regulatory capital levels; and,enhance volatility in loan loss provision and allowance levels from quarter to quarter and year to year, especially duringtimes when the economy is in transition. Changes in regulatory rules can create significant accountingimpacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accountingrules. Changes in those rules can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, such changescan impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financialreporting. A reduction in our taxable earnings outlook, reduction inour income tax rate, or both could adversely affect the value of our deferred tax asset. At December 31, 2017 our gross deferredtax asset after valuation allowance was approximately $330.6 million. The value of our deferred tax asset depends in part upon our estimation of our ability to realize theasset during applicable future periods and upon our estimate of our effective tax rate. Changes in income tax rates applicable to us can positivelyor adversely affect the value of our deferred tax asset suddenly. Increases in rates tend to make our deferred tax assets (“DTA”) more valuable, whiledecreases tend to reduce value. As an example, in response to corporate tax rate cuts enacted late in 2017, we recognized an $82.0million charge against fourth quarter earnings, a substantial majority of which related to DTA valuation adjustments. TaxReform Law Risks  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Law”),enacted late in 2017, creates the potential for significant operating benefits for us in the long term, but also creates the potentialfor certain risks. In most cases the actual effects of the Law will not be known for some time. An immediate impact to us of the Tax Reform Law’s reductionin the corporate income tax rate was a substantial charge to earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily to reflect estimatedloss in value of our deferred tax assets. These assets generally represent tax deductions we anticipate taking in the future.The value of any future deductiondepends heavily upon the tax rate expected to apply in the future. The Tax Reform Law restricts our ability to deduct FDIC premiums,which effectively increases the cost of this expense. If later we exceed $50 billion in asset size, we will not be able todeduct FDIC premiums at all. The Tax Reform Law limits the ability of a business to deductnet business interest expense. For many businesses, this provision will make the costs of borrowing higher, and therefore couldtend to discourage borrowing, especially in those sectors which rely heavily on borrowed capital. 33The Tax Reform Law may reduce an individual’s ability todeduct home mortgage interest and property taxes. This provision could tend to weaken demand for home mortgage and home equityloans by making the practical costs higher, and for similarreasons could adversely affect home values. Those impacts may behigher in high-price, high-income markets and lower in other markets. Risksof Holding our Stock  The principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock,as well as service our debt, is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank cannot currently pay dividends to us withoutregulatory approval. We primarily depend upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our commonand preferred stockholders, and to service our outstanding debt. Regulatory constraints may prevent the Bank from declaring andpaying dividends to us in 2018 without regulatory approval. Applying the applicable regulatory rules, as of December 31, 2017 and2016, the Bank had negative $156.7 million and negative $132.5 million, respectively, available for dividends. At January 1, 2018, under those rules, the Bank could legally declare cash dividends on the Bank’s common or preferred stockof approximately $51.1 million without obtaining regulatory approval. That amount will improveduring 2018 only to the extent that the Bank’s earnings for the year exceed preferred and any common dividends for the year. Also, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank.Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable fordividends. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policystatements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings.The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general mattera bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) thebankholding company’s net income available to shareholders forthe past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) thebank holding company’s prospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needsand overall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in dangerof not meeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. Our stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capitalthrough public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. Ifwe raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownershipof our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to thoseof our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders.We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutive to stockholders. Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charterand bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging athird party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquireus even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders.  "

Forward-looking statementsare not a representation of historical information, but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial results orother developments. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,”“should,” “is likely,” “will,” “going forward,” and other expressions that indicatefuture events and trends identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based uponestimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitiveuncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and many of which, with respect to future businessdecisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties andcontingencies include, among other important factors: global, general, and local economic and business conditions, includingeconomic recession or depression; the stability or volatility of values and activity in the residential housing andcommercial real estate markets; potential requirements for us to repurchase, or compensate for losses from, previously soldor securitized mortgages or securities based on such mortgages; potential claims alleging mortgage servicing failures,individually, on a class basis, or as master servicer of securitized loans; potential claims relating to participation ingovernment programs, especially lending or other financial services programs; expectations of and actual timing and amount ofinterest rate movements, including the slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financialservices institution; market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage markets; inflation or deflation;customer, investor, competitor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financialcondition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopoliticaldevelopments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedgingpractices; technological changes; fraud,theft, or other incursions through conventional,electronic, or other means affecting us directly or affecting our customers, business counterparties, or competitors; demandfor our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; the increasing use of newtechnologies to interact with customers and others; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent inoriginating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions,fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles.Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB),the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve),the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the U.S. Department ofthe Treasury (Treasury), the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB),the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and otherregulators and agencies; pending, threatened, or possible future regulatory, administrative, and judicial outcomes, actions,and proceedings; current or future Executive orders; changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success inexecuting our business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results todiffer, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-lookingstatements that are made in this report on Form 10-K, in our 2016 Annual Report, or in any other statement, release, report, orfiling from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change, possibly materially, because of one or morefactors, including those factors listed above or presented below, in other Items of this report, or in material incorporated byreference into this report. Readers of this report, including our 2016 Annual Report, should carefully consider the factors discussedin this Item 1A below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. CompetitionRisks We are subject to intense competition for customers, andthe nature of that competition ischanging quickly. Our primary areas of competition for customers include: consumerand commercial17deposits and loans, financial planning and wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgagesand lines of credit, fixed income products and services, and other consumer and business financial products and services. Our competitorsin these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies,trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securitiesfirms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financial services companies (traditional and otherwise) that serve themarkets which we serve. Some competitors are traditional banks, subject to the sameregulatory framework as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degreeof regulation. Long-standing examples of less-regulated activity include check-cashing and independent ATM services. A recent exampleof unregulated activity is so-called “peer-to-peer” lending, where investors provide debt capital directly to borrowers. Through technological innovations and changes in customer habits,the manner in which customers use financial services is changing. We provide a large number of services remotely (desktop, online,or mobile), and physical branch utilization has been in long-term decline throughout the industry for many years. Technology hashelped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has allowed disruptors to enter traditional banking areas. Some traditionalconsumer banking services are largely provided through retailers, especially grocery stores and so-called super-stores which customersvisit frequently. Companies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse) and Starbucks (a large chain of cafes) providepayment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible until recent times.Also, the nature of technology-driven competition is startingto change. A number of recent technologies have worked with the existing financial system and traditional banks, such as the evolutionof ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolution of debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of technologies oftenhave expanded the market for banking services overall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banksand disrupting prior methods of delivering those services. Companies which claim to offer applications and services based on artificialintelligence are beginning to compete much more directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personaladvice, including high-margin services such as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these“robo-advisor” services can be especially attractive to younger, less-affluent customers and potential customers. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intensewith respect to most of our products and services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affecteditems, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional information regarding competition forcustomers, refer to the “Competition” heading of Item 1 beginning on page 13of this report. We compete for talent. Our most significant competitorsfor customers also are our most significant competitors for top talent. See “Operational Risks” beginning on page 24of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk. We compete to raise capital in the equityand debt markets. See “Liquidity and Funding Risks” beginning on page 29of this Item 1A for additional information concerning this risk. Riskfrom Economic Downturns and Changes  Generally in an economic downturn our credit losses increase,demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and creditlosses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressureon collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financialservices may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economicfactors that impact demand for loans andother financial products and services. Suchfactors include, for example, changes in employment rates, interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerningrates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global)can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels,compression of our net interest margin, and lower fees from transactions and services. Those effects can continue for manyyears after the downturn technically ends.18RisksAssociated with Monetary Events The Federal Reserve has implemented significant economicstrategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve, and currently is transitioningfrom many years of easing to what may be an uneven, but extended, period of tightening. In recent years, in response to therecession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives.Several of these have emphasized so-called quantitative easing strategies, the most recent of which ended during 2014. Since thenthe Federal Reserve raised rates once in late 2015 and once in late 2016, in each case by a modest 25 basis points. Further ratechanges reportedly are dependent on the Federal Reserve’s assessment of economic data as it becomes available. This data-dependentprocess, now in its third year, may represent a fitful transition to a tightening trend, or it may represent merely an interimperiod during which rates have little clear up or down long-term trend. Federal Reserve strategies can, and often are intended to,affect the domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve oftenare most pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things,easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economicactivity, while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply,and restrain economic activity. Other things being equal, a transition from easing to tightening should tend to diminish or reversedownward pressure on rates, and to diminish or end the stimulus effect that low rates tend to have on the economy. Many externalfactors may interfere with the effects of these plans or cause them to be changed unexpectedly. Such factors include significanteconomic trends or events as well as significant international monetary policies and events.An example of the former is the substantialdrop in oil prices experienced during 2015 and the first half of 2016. An example of the latter is the July 2016 United Kingdomreferendum calling for the U.K. to leave the European Union. Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financialsystems in ways that may be difficult to predict. Risks associated with interest rates and the yield curve are discussed in thisItem 1A under the caption “Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks” beginning on page 30. We may be adversely affected by economic and political situationsoutside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our customers, are linked significantly to economic and marketconditions outside the U.S., especially in North America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in Central and South America. Althoughwe have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or non-US sovereign debt, in the future major adverse eventsoutside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impactinclude (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default,(iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapse of governments, alliances,or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affect us are highly varied but broadlyinclude the following: an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailability of borrowed funds throughconventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our customers; impacts upon the U.S. economy,especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts uponus from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible political response to majorfinancial disruptions. StrategicRisks We may be unable to successfully implement our strategy togrow our consumer and commercial banking businesses and our fixed income business. In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategyin response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions. In 2008 we sold our national mortgage platforms and closedour national lending operations. Since then we have closed a number of other units and sold loans and servicing assets, furtherreducing our exposure to legacy operations. More importantly, we renewed ouremphasis on traditional banking and fixed income productsand services. Although our current strategy is expected to evolve as businessconditions continue to change, at present our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking and fixed income businesses.Growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in the past threeyears has been largely organic but was enhanced by tactical acquisitions. In recent years we have enhanced our19market share inour traditional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into other southeast U.S. markets with similar characteristics,and expanded with commercial lending and private client banking in the Houston, Texas market. We have made similar moves inour fixed income business. Our acquisitions in that period have included a bank, bank branches, and commercial loans, and at year-endwe have an agreement to acquire a fixed income firm specializing in government guaranteed loans. In the future, we may rely moreon acquisitions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves, but we expect to continueto nurture profitable organic growth as well. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a numberof key elements, including:  ●our ability to attract and retain customers in                                         our banking market areas;    ●our ability to achieve and maintain growth in our                                         earnings while pursuing new business opportunities;    ●in our fixed income business, our ability to maintain                                         or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying                                         and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and                                         services to new or existing customers;     ●our ability to maintain a high level of customer                                         service while reducing our physical branch count due to changing customer demand, all                                         while expanding our remote banking services and expanding or enhancing our information                                         processing, technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructures effectively                                         and efficiently;     ●our ability to manage the liquidity and capital                                         requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-funded acquisitions;                                         and    ●our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by a complex, burdensome, and evolving regulatory environment.We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elementsthat are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, asconditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions,we face various additional risks, including: ●our ability to identify,                                         analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in                                         the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;    ●our ability to integrate                                         the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;   ●our ability to manage                                         any operational or cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions;                                            ●our ability to integrate                                         the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and,   ●our ability to retain                                         core customers and key employees of the acquired company. A type of strategic acquisition—a so-called “mergerof equals” where the company we nominally acquire has similar size, operating contribution, or value—presents uniqueopportunities but also unique risks. Those special risks include: ●the potential for                                         elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two companies                                         efficiently in a reasonable amount of time;    ●a significant increase                                         in the time horizon that may be needed before any substantial economies of scale are                                         realized; and,   ●under current laws,                                         the prospect of substantially increased regulatory burdens and costs if the combined                                         company exceeds $50 billion in asset size.  RisksRelated to Businesses We May Exit We may be unable to successfully implement a dispositionof businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adaptto a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include: ●our ability to price                                         a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;●our ability to identify                                         and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid                                         or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;  ●our ability to assess                                         and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses;                                         and20●our ability to manage                                         capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise if an exit results in   significant                                         legacy cash expenditures or financial loss.  LegacyMortgage Business Risks We have  risks from the mortgage-related businesseswe have exited, including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, claimsof non-compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements, and the risk of higher default rates on loans made by our formerbusinesses. In 2008 we exited our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses. However, we still retain asassets a significant amount of loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other realestate situated across the U.S. We retain the risk of liability to customers and contractual parties with whom we dealt in thecourse of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include: ●We experienced elevated                                         losses related to claims that we did not comply with contractual or other legal requirements                                         when we sold mortgage loans. Losses may continue, irregularly, for some time to come.                                         In 2012 and 2013 we recognized significant expense as a result of substantial settlements                                         with the two largest purchasers of our mortgages prior to 2009. Although our expenses                                         related to these matters have declined substantially, and in two of the last three years                                         we experienced reserve releases, new information could be received in the future resulting                                         in adverse adjustments related to exposures not covered by the settlements. Our total                                         repurchase and foreclosure provision expense was $299.3 million for 2012, $170.0 million                                         for 2013, negative $4.3 million for 2014, zero for 2015, and negative $32.7 million for                                         2016.    ●We are defending litigation matters associated with claims arising                                         out of our former mortgage securitization activities. The outcome of those matters is                                         uncertain; losses in excess of current accruals (reserves) could be material.    ●The trustee for those securitizations could demand repurchase                                         of loans placed into securitizations or make-whole damages if we breached contractual                                         requirements or obligations, or could demand that we indemnify the trustee if the trustee                                         is sued. We have received one such indemnity demand, for expenses.   ●We have responded to investigations and inquiries by various                                         parties, including government agencies, related to mortgage loans we originated. Inquiries                                         have been wide ranging. A few have led to  litigation. One investigation, involving the                                         FHA insurance program, led to a settlement of $212.5 million in 2015.    ●We could be subject to claims that servicing-related actions were done or not done improperly.Although we may be able to demand indemnity in cases where servicing was performed on our behalf by another institution, thereis risk that such an indemnity demand could be refused by the institution or rejected by an appropriate court. Other trends adverse to us may emerge from this legacybusiness. Additional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them, allof which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions “Repurchase Obligations,Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations” beginning on page 57, “Repurchase andForeclosure Liability” beginning on page 61, and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page65 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2016Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of thisreport; and under the captions “Material Matters” and “Obligations from Legacy Mortgage Businesses”beginning on pages 129 and 131, respectively, which is part of the material from our 2016 Annual Report that hasbeen incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Although we sold our mortgage servicing business and manyof our servicing assets in 2008, we have  exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligations and assets which weretained after 2008, especially in relation to the subservicing arrangements we made between 2008 and the sale of substantiallyall our remaining servicing assets which we completed in 2014. Government authorities have announced substantial mortgage-relatedsettlements with major U.S. and foreign banks. Regulations pertaining to servicing have been changed, imposing stricter dutiesand standards upon servicers. State, federal, or private inquiries or investigations into our servicing and foreclosure activitiesmay be commenced. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries, actions, or regulatory changes or the21impact thatthey could have on our financial condition, results of operations, or business. When we sold our origination and servicing businesses in 2008we retained significant servicing obligations and assets. At that time we engaged as our subservicer the purchaser of our business.In 2011 that engagement expired and we engaged a new subservicer. Our 2008 subservicer experienced significant losses in connectionwith its servicing business. Our 2008 subservicer has informed us that it expects us to reimburse it for a significant portionof its losses and costs under our subservicing agreement. We disagree with our 2008 subservicer’s position and have madeno reimbursements. We also believe that certain amounts billed us by agencies for penalties and curtailments of claims by the subservicerprior to the 2011 subservicing transfer but billed after that date are owed by the subservicer. This disagreement has the potentialto result in litigation and, in any such future litigation, the claim against us may be substantial. Additional information concerning risks relatedto servicing and foreclosure practices and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A bythis reference, is set forth: under the captions “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 61,“Foreclosure Practices” beginning on page 64, and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning onpage 65 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our2016 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 ofthis report; and under the captions “Servicing Obligations” and “Repurchase andForeclosure Liability” in Note 17 – Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on pages 132 and 134,respectively, of our 2016 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated byreference into Item 8 of this report. Several large purchasers of mortgage-backed securities havefiled suits against the trustees for those securitizations asserting new theories of liability. The trustee of our securitizationsis defending or co-defending such matters, and many of our securitizations are among those alleged to have been purchased by theplaintiffs. The claims for damages are based in part on allegations that the trustee did not properly or timely act against theoriginators of the securitizations or the servicers of the loans, and further assert that the trustee has affirmative duties toactwhich were not set forth in the legal trust documents. Some of the legal theories advanced are untested or unsettled. Althoughwe are not a defendant in these proceedings, these complex suits may progress or evolve so as to compel us to defend ourselvesor our trustee, and could create financial exposure for us. We have elevated loss exposures associated with past lendingunder various government programs. Like most banks we have participated for many years in government-sponsored lending programs.At the federal level, during the period before we sold our national mortgage origination and servicing businesses, two prominentprograms for us were the FHA and VA mortgage lending programs. Those programs require lenders like us to comply with various requirementsin originating the loans. Non-compliance can lead to an agency demand that the lender reimburse resulting losses. An agency also could demand enhanced damages, including trebledamages, under various federal laws. A number of federal laws, including the False Claims Act, provide for substantial recoveriesand penalties if false information is provided to a federal agency, and also provide that private citizens may sue in the nameof the agency and obtain a portion of any recovery as a bounty. Some of these laws provide legal avenues for a wide variety ofgovernmental agency claims, while others can have a narrower focus but include non-governmental claims. In some cases the lawsprovide for bounties if the government agency obtains a recovery. It is possible that suits under the False Claims Act or anotherlaw may be brought regarding our past, present, or future financial business activities, either by a federal agency, by anotherparty to those activities, or by an unrelated private person interested in pursuing the bounty. In 2012 we settled a private actionof that sort related to a portion of our past VA lending, and in 2015 we settled with government agencies regarding our FHA lending.In 2015-16 we defended a private action of that sort successfully, obtaining a dismissal which was upheld on appeal. Additional information concerning these governmentprogram risks, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth under the caption“Obligations from Legacy Mortgage Businesses” in Note 17 – Contingencies and Other Disclosures beginning on page 131of our 2016 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8of this report. ReputationRisks  Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtainand retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practicesand financial stability. Ourreputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how those practicesare22perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole,also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationshipsmay adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management. Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to accessthe capital markets or otherwise impact ourliquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones,could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our abilityto attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry,may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrainour business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk. CreditRisks We face the risk that our customers may not repay their loansand that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that other counterparties,in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit charge-offsis unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary substantially over time. To take the most recent example, netcharge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007, and increased to $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginningin 2010, net charge-offs began to decline, reaching $48.4 million in 2014, $31.2 million in 2015, and $19.2 million in 2016. Inrecent years, our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels. The allowance for loan loss was $202.1 million as ofDecember 31, 2016, down substantially from $896.9 million and $849.2 million at year-end 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon ourability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including realestate, among other things. We further manage lending credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity,by following per-relationship lending limits, and by recording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentionedabove and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways,some of which are discussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of havingtoo much risk concentrated with any single counterparty. We record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting andregulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption “Accounting & Tax Risks” beginningon page 32, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense orcharge-offs to increase, or to be recognized on an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performanceof our portfolio.Moreover, the SEC or PCAOB could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistentwith those taken by the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other banking regulators. A significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and othermodels and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment,in real estate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, basedon our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Changes in modeling could have significant impacts upon ourreported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lendingbusinesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisionscould be misguided or otherwise affected with substantial adverse consequences to us. A significant subset of our home equity lines of credit wereoriginated prior to our national platform sale in 2008. A large number of those loans recently have been and (through 2018) willbe switching from interest-only payments to full amortization payments of principal and interest combined. In reserving for potentialloss in this portfolio we model an increased rate of default associated with the higher monthly payment requirements when thatswitch occurs. Our modeling is based, among other things, on our experience with this portfolio, but risk remains that actual defaultrates could exceed our modeling.  The  low-interest rate environment has elevated thetraditional challenge for lenders and investors to balance taking on higher risk against the desire for higher income oryield. This challenge applies not only to credit risk in our lending activities but also to default and rate risksregarding  investments.23The composition of our loan portfolio inherently increasesour sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2016, approximately 62% of total loans consisted of the commercial,financial, and industrial (C&I) category, while approximately 23% consisted of the consumer real estate category. The largest component of the C&I category at year end wasloans to finance and insurance companies, a component which represented about 21% of the C&I category at that time. The secondlargest component was loans to mortgage companies. As a result, approximately 38% of the C&I category was sensitive to impactson the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financial servicesindustry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in real estateand other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions, than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industrycould dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio. The consumer real estate category contains a number of concentrationswhich affect credit risk assessment of the category. ●Product concentration. The consumer real estate category consists primarily of consumer installment loans, and muchof the remainder consists of home equity lines of credit.   ●Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 31% of the categoryconsists of loans secured on a second-lien basis.   ●Geographic concentration. At year end about 69% of the category related to Tennessee customers, 5% related to California,and no other state represented more than 3% of the category.   ●Legacy concentration. A significant part of the consumer category still consists of loans originated before 2009 byour legacy national mortgage lending business. Those are loans we originated and did not sell, along with loans we have repurchasedin the course of resolving claims with loan buyers. Our legacy loans have been shrinking in recent years, but remain substantial.The consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economicimpacts on consumer customers and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significantlife events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, in the currentenvironment regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer categoryand our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types. Our exposure to the volatile oil & gas industry is modestbut growing. Our Houston office, opened in 2014, specializes in commercial lending and private banking. Commercial lendingin that office significantly focuses on three categories: energy, commercial real estate (CRE), and commercial, financial, &industrial (C&I). Much of our Houston business is connected, at least in part, to the energy industry, especially oil and gasproduction and distribution. In addition to general credit and other risks mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, the energy businessand related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to that industry. Key among those is global demand for energyand other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. The shifting balance between demand and supply is expressed most simplyin prices. Starting in late 2014 and continuing into 2016, oil prices fell substantially, putting financial pressure on businessesin that industry, especially highly leveraged businesses. Starting in 2016 and continuing into early 2017, oil prices improved,though still well below pre-2014 levels. Although the financial impact from recent volatility on our overall loan business wasrelatively modest, we did experience elevated charge-offs. The impact was moderate in part because we did not have a substantialportfolio in the industry before prices started to fall. Going forward, volatility in oil prices could impact our financial performanceand growth of our Houston-based lending business. Additional information concerning credit risks and our managementof them is set forth under the captions “Asset Quality—Trend Analysis of 2016 Compared to 2015” beginning onpage 26, “Credit Risk Management” beginning on page 52,and “Allowance for Loan Losses” beginning on page 65 of the Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2016 Annual Report, which is part of thematerial from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. OperationalRisks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependentin part upon our ability to create,maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure,24manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arisein many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes;faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and relatedsecurity breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequaciesmay present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, informationtechnology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficientlyadaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable.Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challenges as we striveto maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost. A serious information technology security (cybersecurity)breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, thatdamage can occur due to outright theft of funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers, or adverse publicity associatedwith a breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certain vendors, all of whomlegitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentiallyvery serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and externalsecurity concerns to a high degree, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining tobank safety and customer protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older andmore basic. For example, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft, and otherelectronic crimes, and we educate our customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expectour systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve. The operational functions we outsource to third parties mayexperience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in some cases, limitedability to obtain quickly an alternate vendor. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform or assist operationalfunctions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult.The operational functions of business counterparties mayexperience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in recentyears several major U.S. retailers and a major electronic mail provider experienced data systems incursions reportedly resultingin the thefts of credit and debit card information, online account information, and other data of millions of customers. Retailerincursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Although our systems are notbreached in retailer incursions, these events can increase account fraud and can cause us to reissue a significant number of accountcards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our customers. Our ability to recoup our lossesmay be limited legally or practically in many situations. Other possible points of incursion or disruption not within our controlinclude internet service providers, social media portals, distant-server (“cloud”) service providers, electronic datasecurity providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers. Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure,failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructurecomponents suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable regulatorystandards. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated intothis Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “Operational Risk Management” beginning on page 52of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2016 Annual Report,which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. The delivery of financial services to customers and othersincreasingly depends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risksdiscussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untestedtechnologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectualproperty infringement. Competition for talent is substantial and increasing. Moreover,revenue growth in some business lines increasingly depends upon top talent. In 2015 and252016 the cost to us of hiring and retainingtop revenue-producing talent increased, and that trend is likely to continue. The primary tools we use to attract and retain talentare: salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits;health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we facethe risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively. Incentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverseeffects. Incentive programs are difficult todesign well, and even if well-designed often they must be updated to address changesin our business. A poorly designed incentive program—where goals are too difficult, too easy, or not well related to desiredoutcomes—could provide little useful motivation to key employees, could increase turnover, and could impact customer retention.Moreover, even where those pitfalls are avoided, incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences. For example, aprogram focused entirely on revenue production, without proper controls, may result in costs growing faster than revenues. ServiceRisks We provide a wide range of servicesto customers, and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we providedthem in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Ourservices include lending, loan servicing, fiduciary, custodial, depositary, funds management, insurance, and advisory services,among others. We manage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Additionalinformation concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference,appears under the captions “Operational Risk Management” and “Compliance Risk Management,” both beginningon page 52 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations section of our 2016 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporatedby reference into Item 7 of this report. Regulatory,Legislative, and Legal Risks  The regulatory environment is challenging, and the regulatoryimpacts on us have become more restrictive and more costly. We operate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environmenthas changed significantly in the past ten years, and our regulatory burdens generally have increased, as a result of macro eventsaffecting traditional banking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. We are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securitiesbrokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly tradedin the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulationscould result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations mayincrease our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See “Supervision and Regulation”in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 5, for additional information concerningfinancial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financialinstitution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conductour business, such as in theareas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authoritiesincreasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interestor fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms orprofitability of the products and services we offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and stateconsumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restrictingour ability to share or receive customer information and increasing our costs. The following paragraphs highlight certain specific importantrisk areas related to regulatory matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do notdescribe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish as circumstanceschange. We and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatorycapital levels and ratios. In 2013 regulators adopted enhancements to U.S. capital standards based on international standardsknown as “Basel III.” The revised standards emphasize Common26Equity Tier 1 Capital, restrict eligibility criteria forregulatory capital instruments, and make more stringent the methodology for calculating risk-weighted assets. The revised standardsbegan to apply to us in 2015, and are discussed in Item 1 of this report, in tabular and narrative form, under the caption “CapitalAdequacy” starting on page 8. Pressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and addressbusiness needs in the current economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders. Suchactions could include: reduction or elimination of dividends; the issuance of common or preferred stock, or securities convertibleinto stock; or the issuance of any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classesof common or preferred stock. Additional information concerning these risks and our managementof them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions “Capital Adequacy”and “Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)” in Item 1 of this report beginning on pages8 and 9, respectively; under the captions “Capital—2016 Compared to 2015,” “Capital Management andAdequacy,” and “Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends” beginning on pages23, 51, and 63, respectively, of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationssection of our 2016 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference intoItem 7 of this report; and under the caption “Regulatory Capital” in Note 12—RegulatoryCapital and Restrictions, beginning on page 121 of our 2016 Annual Report, whichis part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. We are required to conduct and submit annual stress tests,the outcomes of which could further increase our capital requirements and could damage our reputation and our ability to obtaincredit. Stress testing processes require banks to estimate the impact on capital, liquidity, and other measures of safety ofcertain assumed environmental shocks. A failure to satisfy regulatory stress testing, or another significant risk management standard,could result in the imposition of operating restrictions on us and require us to raise capital, which could adversely affect operatingresults or be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, a summary of a portion of the stress results must be made public. A poorresult could impact our reputation generally and our ability to borrow funds. New regulatory initiatives under Dodd-Frank and otherwisemay have unintended adverse impactsupon us or the industry. For example, stress testing includes “rate shocks”which model the financial impact of sudden large increases in market interest rates upon us. In practical effect this encouragesbanks to shorten the “duration” of their assets (loans and investments), discouraging long-term assets. Shorteningduration should improve a bank’s ability to withstand a very large rate shock. However, it also can reduce the effectiveyield a bank receives from its assets, which would put downward pressure on revenues, margins, and earnings. Legal disputes are an unavoidable part of business; the outcomeof litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty. We face the risk of litigation from customers, employees, vendors, contractualparties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. We manage those risks throughinternal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means.However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty. Typically we are unable to estimate our loss exposure fromclaims against us until relatively late in the litigation process, which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigationunpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next. Currently we are defending a number of legal matters. For mostof them we have established either no accrual (reserve) or no significant reserve. Financial accounting guidance requires thatlitigation loss be both estimable and probable before a reserve may be established (recorded as a liability on our balance sheet).For most litigation matters, under that guidance reserves typically are not established until after preliminary motions to dismissor narrow the case are resolved, after discovery is substantially in process, and (in many cases) after preliminary overtures regardingsettlement have occurred. Potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserveis established. Moreover, it is not uncommon for a case to experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long periodfollowed by a brief period of rapid development. Lastly, although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us, for theothers loss typically is recognized either all at once (near the time of resolution) or very unevenly over the life of the case. Additional information concerning litigation risks and our managementof them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the caption “Legacy Mortgage BusinessRisks” beginning on page 21 of this report; under the captions “RepurchaseObligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations,” “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability,”“Market27Uncertainties and Prospective Trends,” and “Contingent Liabilities” beginning on pages57, 61, 63, and 68, respectively, of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations section of our 2016 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has beenincorporated by referenceinto Item 7 of this report; and under the caption “Contingencies” in Note 17—Contingenciesand Other Disclosures, beginning on page 128 of our 2016 Annual Report, which ispart of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Risksof Expense Control  Our ability to successfully manage expenses is importantto our long-term survival and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence theamount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additionalexpenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, amongother things. The importance of managing expenses has been amplified in the current slow growth, low net interest margin businessenvironment. Overall, our noninterest expenses havebeen improving: in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2016 noninterest expense was $1,369.5 million, $1,148.5 million, $832.5 million,$1,053.8 million, and $925.2 million, respectively. Volatility in noninterest expensehas been significantly affected by increasingly idiosyncratic charges related to legacy mortgage activities as discussed in thisItem 1A under the caption “Legacy Mortgage Business Risks” beginning on page21. We manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety ofmeans, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recentyears we have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking andright-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usuallyentail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs,and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future.  We have also re-focused our attention on the economic profitgenerated by our business activities and prospects rather than merely revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attemptsto relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returnson capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The processis intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment of our resources. Economic profit analysis involves significant judgmentregarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminished profitabilityover the long run. Despite our efforts, our costs could rise due to adverse structuralchanges or market shifts. For example, the overall cost of our health insurance benefit is highly dependent upon regulatory factorsand market forces beyond our control. GeographicRisks We are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions.To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarilyimpact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If the southeastern U.S., and Tennessee inparticular, were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degreenot shared by those competitors which have a broader or different regional footprint. We have international assets in the form of loans and lettersof credit. Holding non-U.S assets creates a number of risks:  the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions,and other barriersand constraints may be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk that currencyexchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollar value ofliabilities; and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our ability tomanage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences inlegal, cultural, and other expectations applicable to customers, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties;and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed. 28Insurance Our property and casualty insurance may not cover or maybe inadequate to cover the risks that we face, and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by the insurers that provideus mortgage and bank-owned life insurance. We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction ofproperty as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance maybe inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, we also face the risksthat the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a typeof credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. Therisk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractual situation. A portion of our consumer loan portfolio involves mortgage defaultinsurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adverselyaffect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provisionor write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financialresults. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades orinsolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impactwould be amplified. We own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assetson our books. Some of those policies are “general account” and others are “separate account.” The generalaccount policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separateaccount policies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underliethose policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularlyfor the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantlylimited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon earlypolicy termination. When we self-insure certain exposures, our estimates of futureexpenditures may be inadequate for actual expenditures that occur. For example, we self-insure our employee health-insurancebenefit program. We estimate future expenditures and establish accruals (reserves) based on the estimates. If actual expenditureswere to exceed our estimates in a future period, our future expenses could be adversely and unexpectedly increased. Liquidityand Funding Risks Liquidity is essential to our business model and a lack ofliquidity or an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financialconditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore,can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2015 and 2016 were met principally by deposits,by financing from other financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets. Deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable fundsand by far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. If the economy improvesor market rates rise, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly, as depositors become more comfortable withrisk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could pressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink our net interestmargin if loan rates do not rise correspondingly.The market among banks for deposits may be impacted as a resultof the relatively new Basel III capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Moreover, institutionswith more than $50 billion of assets are required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. Larger banks covered by thisrule may be incented to compete for core deposits vigorously. Although mid-sized banks, like ours, are not directly impacted bythis rule, if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions we could lose deposit share or be compelled to adjust ourdeposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs. We also depend upon financing from private institutional orother investors by means of the capital markets. In 2014 we issued $400 million of senior bank notes due 2019, and in 2015 we issued$500 million of senior notes due 2020. The 2015 notes refinanced an earlier five-year notes issue. Presently we believe we couldaccess the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may become unavailable tous for reasons beyond our control.29A number of more general factors could make funding more difficult,more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational or politicalchanges, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets,specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolioor other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions,general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. Inaddition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial marketsas well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may remain or become increasingly difficultdue to economic and other factors beyond our control. Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factorsmay adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business. As a result, disruptions in thoseareas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit. CreditRatings Our credit ratings directly affect the availability andcost of our unsecured funding. The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecuredborrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debtrating of Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings,is considered investment grade for many purposes. At December 31, 2016, all three rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of FHN and of the Bank as investmentgrade, although we were at or near the lowest levels of investment grade. The ratings outlook from one of the ratings agencieswas positive, and from the other two was stable, for both FHN and the Bank. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital,we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularlyif lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings inthe future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or onwatchlist. Please note that a credit rating is nota recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independentlyof any other rating. Reductions in our credit ratings could result in counterpartiesreducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restrictingthe business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold. Reductions in our credit ratings could allow counterpartiesto terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateralwith respect to certain derivatives agreements. At this time, those of our ISDA master agreements which have ratings triggersreference the lower of S&P’s or Moody’s ratings.  Based on those ratings, for some time we have been requiredto post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties. Should a creditrating downgrade occur, the maximum additional collateral we would have been required to post is approximately $1 millionas of December 31, 2016. InterestRate and Yield Curve Risks We are subject to interest rate risk because a significantportion of our business involves borrowing and lending money, and investing in financial instruments. A significant portionof our funding comes from short-term and demand deposits, while a significant portion of our lending and investing is in medium-termand long-term instruments. Changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues andexpenses, and could expand or compress ournet interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought aboutby ordinary fluctuations in rates. A flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interestmargin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicableto short and long30term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-termrates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yieldcurve usually is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted. A flat or inverted yieldcurve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demandfor long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business. A goal and effect of certainactions by the Federal Reserve over the past few years has been to flatten the yield curve, and our net interest margin has declinedover this period. We may be in a transitional period, from a low-rate environmentto one with more normal, or at least somewhat higher, rates and a somewhat steeper yield curve. If that is correct, the new environmentshould be positive for us, overall, in the long term. However, some effects may be negative and the timing of various effects willbe uneven. Examples include: (i) rising rates may create transitory but significant outflows of deposits, which in turn couldnecessitate additional (and more costly) borrowing or raising deposit rates more quickly than anticipated; (ii) rising rates arelikely to dampen consumer demand for mortgages, which could quickly reduce demand for our mortgage warehouse lending products;and (iii) mortgage demand may change unevenly, with a briefuptick (to lock in still-low rates) followed by a more pronounced down-trend. Although our overall balance sheet remains asset-sensitive,in recent quarters we have partially moderated that sensitivity, which would somewhat diminish the benefits we otherwise wouldrealize from a general rise in interest rates. Our management of our assets and liabilities results in our being “asset-sensitive.”As such, a general rise in rates should benefit us if, as we expect, the deposit and other rates we pay tend to rise more slowlythan the rates we charge or receive on our assets.  We believe an asset sensitive balance sheet is still appropriate. However, as short-term rates begin to rise from near zero, this risk of a future lowering of interest rates becomes more significant. In light of that risk, in recent quarters we have taken steps to moderate our asset sensitivity.  These steps would somewhatdiminish the benefits we otherwise would realize from a general rise in interest rates while reducing the risks from a generalfall in interest rates. Expectations by the market regarding the direction of futureinterest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed incomebusiness. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, orwhen expectations are especially weak or uncertain. SecuritiesInventories and Market Risks The trading securities inventories we hold in our fixed incomebusiness are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securities inventory positionsfor purposes of distributions to customers, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributable principally to credit riskand interest rate risk associated with fixed-income securities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities throughcertain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk (“VaR”)limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. Average fixed income trading securities (long positions) were $1.2 billionfor 2016, $1.3 billion for 2015, and $1.1 billion for 2014. Average fixed income trading liabilities (short positions) were $.8billion, $.7 billion, and $.6 billion for 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Additional information concerning these risks andour management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “MarketRisk Management” beginning on page 48 of the Management’s Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations section of our 2016 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in marketsor market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokeragebusiness and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market pricescan adversely affect those revenue sources. Significant changes to the securities market’s performancecan have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assets and obligationsthat are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a materialimpact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. An example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pensionplan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in31the future. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimatesof benefits claims, the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims, and estimates of plan asset values.Our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors. Accordingly, our obligations diminishif the plan’s investments perform better than expectations or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance, andcan grow if those investments perform poorly or if expectations worsen. A rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impactthe values of fixed income assets held in the plan, but could also result in an increase in the discount rate used to measure thepresent value of future benefit payments. Similarly, our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarialinputs. We manage the risk of rate changes by investing plan assets in fixed income securities having maturities aligned with theexpected timing of payouts. Because there are no new participants, the actuarial-input risk should diminish over time, althoughvery slowly. Changes in our funding obligation generally translate into positiveor negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Our obligations and expensesrelative to the plan can be affected by many other things,including changes in our participating employee population and changesto the plan itself. Although we have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some levelof volatility is unavoidable. Our hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequatelyhedge our risks, and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or fulleconomic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. For example: our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on aportion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; and, we use derivatives, including swaps,swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rateschange. Generally, in the latter example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk thatthe other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the riskthat the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failurecould have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Accounting & Tax Risks The preparation of our consolidated financial statementsin conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affectthe financial statements.  The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of the allowance for creditlosses. However, other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length. Currentlythose include: the level of reserves for loan repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure losses; the valuation of our deferred taxassets; and the valuation of our goodwill. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates areadjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantlyincrease the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance,or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwill or other assets, or we may make some other adjustmentthat will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation andother contingency matters where critical information is inadequate, we are entirely unable to make estimates until fairly latein a lengthy process.We lack first-hand visibility regarding certainloans, other assets, or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. For example,interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and lines of credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 familyresidential properties requires that the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessing the collectabilityand inherent loss of a performing junior lien. Additionally, the OCC has clarified that an institution’s incomerecognition policy should incorporate management’s consideration of all reasonably available information including, forjunior liens, the performance of the associated senior liens as well as trends in other credit quality indicators. We ownand service a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. Asof December 31, 2016, that amount was $4.5 billion. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $1.3 billion, or 28 percent, ofthe consumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone second liens while $.1 billion, or 3 percent, were owned orserviced by FHN. We are not able to actively monitor the performance status of the first liens that are serviced by others.We obtain first lien performance information from third parties and through loss32mitigation activities, and we place a stand-alone second lien loan on nonaccrual if we discover that there are performanceissues with the first lien loan. It is possible that if our evaluation methods change or information sources otherwise improveour additions to nonperforming loans may be material. Changes in accounting rules can significantly affect howwe record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companiesin a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or businessoperations of companies within the same industry. An accounting rule change issued in 2016 is likelyto significantly change how we evaluate and record income and estimates of loss associated with loans and debtsecurities. Loans and debt securities make up a majority of our assets, so the effects of this rule change, whilecurrently unknown, when implemented are likely to be significant and wide-ranging. The rule change will not be effective forseveral years. Additional information concerning this new rule, known as ASU 2016-13, is provided under the caption“Accounting Changes Issued but Not Currently Effective” in Note 1—Summary of Significant AccountingPolicies, beginning on page 96 of our 2016 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report, and under the caption “Accounting Changes Issued but NotCurrently Effective” within the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations section of our 2016 Annual Report, beginning on page 68, which is part of the material from that report that hasbeen incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report.Changes in regulatory rules can create significant accountingimpacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accountingrules. Changes in those rules can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, such changescan impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financialreporting. A reduction in our taxable earnings outlook, corporate income tax reform, or both could adversely affectthe value of our deferred tax asset. At December 31, 2016 our gross deferred tax asset after valuationallowance was approximately $297.0 million and the net deferred tax asset was approximately $199.6 million.The value of our deferred tax asset depends in part upon our estimation of our ability to realize the asset duringapplicable future periods and upon our estimate of our effective tax rate. Tax reform legislation in 2017 may reduce the maximum corporate income tax rate. The President haspublicly favored legislation (not yet formally proposed) to reduce corporate income tax rates to 15 to 20percent, possibly in 2017. Any such rate reduction is likely to be part of a broader tax reform bill. Although arate reduction would have a beneficial effect, certain deductions may be eliminated or reduced as a part of taxreform, which could partially offset the beneficial effect of a rate reduction. Additionally, a rate reductionwould result in the impairment of our deferred tax asset, as mentioned above, in the quarter that it is signed intolaw by the President. Risksof Holding our Stock  The principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on ourstock, as well as service our debt, is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank cannot currently pay dividends tous without regulatory approval. We primarily depend upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay toour common and preferred stockholders, and to service our outstanding debt. Regulatory constraints may prevent the Bank from declaringand paying dividends to us in 2017 without regulatory approval. Applying the applicable regulatory rules, as of December 31, 2016and 2015, the Bank had negative $132.5 million and negative $192.8 million, respectively, available for dividends. On January 1,2017, the Bank’s total amount available for dividends was negative $132.5 million. That amount will improve during 2017 onlyto the extent that the Bank’s earnings for the year exceed preferred and any common dividends for the year.Also, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank.Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable fordividends. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policystatements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings.The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general mattera bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) thebank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends33previously paidduring that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company’s prospective rateof earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financialcondition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capitaladequacy ratios. Our stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capitalthrough public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. Ifwe raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownershipof our current common stockholders will be reduced, the newequity securities may have rights and preferences superior to thoseof our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders.We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutive to stockholders. Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of ourcharter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraginga third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders.   "

Forward-looking statementsare not a representation of historical information, but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial results orother developments. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,”“should,” “is likely,” “will,” “going forward,” and other expressions that indicatefuture events and trends identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimatesand assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies,many of which are beyond our control, and many of which, withrespect to future business decisions and actions (includingacquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other importantfactors: global, general, and local economic and business conditions, including economic recession or depression; the stabilityor volatility of values and activity in the residential housing and commercial real estate markets; potential requirements forus to repurchase, or compensate for losses from, previously sold or securitized mortgages or securities based on such mortgages;potential claims relating to the foreclosure process; potential claims relating to participation in government programs, especiallylending or other financial services programs; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, includingthe slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetaryfluctuations,16including fluctuations in mortgage markets; inflation ordeflation; customer, investor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financialcondition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopoliticaldevelopments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedgingpractices; technological changes; fraud, theft, or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other meansaffecting us directly or affecting our customers, business counterparties, or competitors; demand for our product offerings;new products and services in the industries in which we operate; the increasing use of new technologies to interact withcustomers and others; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, servicing,and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing andother real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions ofthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), the Financial IndustryRegulatory Authority (FINRA), the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury), the Municipal SecuritiesRulemaking Board (MSRB), the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (FDIC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council), thePublic Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), and other regulators and agencies; pending, threatened, or possible futureregulatory, administrative, and judicial outcomes, actions, and proceedings; changes in laws and regulations applicable tous; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, couldcause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update or revise, whether as a resultof new information, future events, or otherwise, any forward-looking statements that are made in our 2015 Annual Report or in anyother statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change, possiblymaterially, because of one or more factors, including those factors listed above or presented below, in other Items of this report,or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report, including our 2015 Annual Report, should carefullyconsider the factors discussed in this Item 1A below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing ourprospects. Competition Risks We are subject to intense competition forcustomers, and the nature of that competition is changing quickly. Our primary areas of competition forcustomers include: retail and commercial deposits and loans, financial planning and wealth management, personal orconsumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, fixed income products and services, and other consumer andbusiness financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savingsand loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money marketand other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, andother financial services companies (traditional and otherwise) that serve the markets which we serve. Some competitors are traditional banks, subject to the sameregulatory framework as we are, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degreeof regulation. Long-standing examples of less-regulated activity include check-cashing and independent ATM services. A recent exampleof unregulated activity is so-called “peer-to-peer” lending, where investors provide lending capital directly to borrowers. Through technological innovations and changes in customer habits,the manner in which customers use financial services is changing. We provide a large number of services remotely (desktop, online,or mobile), and physical branch utilization has been in long-term decline throughoutthe industry for many years. Technology hashelped us reduce costs and improve service, but also has allowed disruptors to enter some traditional banking areas. Some traditionalconsumer banking services now are largely provided through retailers, especially grocery stores and so-called super-stores whichcustomers visit frequently. Companies as disparate as PayPal (an online payment clearinghouse) and Starbucks (a large chain ofcafes) provide payment and exchange services which compete directly with banks in ways not possible until recent times. Also, the nature of technology-driven competition is starting to change. A number of recent technologies have worked withthe existing financial system and traditional banks, such as the evolution of ATM cards into debit/credit cards and the evolutionof debit/credit cards into smart phones. These sorts of technologies often have expanded the market for banking servicesoverall while siphoning a portion of the revenues from those services away from banks and disrupting prior methods of deliveringthose services. Companies which offer heuristic or highly-interactive systems and applications are beginning to compete muchmore directly with traditional financial services companies in areas involving personal advice, including high-margin servicessuch as financial planning and wealth management. The low-cost, high-speed nature of these “robo-advisor” services can beespecially attractive to younger, less-affluent customers and potential customers. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intensewith respect to most of our products and17services. Heightened competition tends to put downward pressureon revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. For additional informationregarding competition for customers, refer to the “Competition” heading of Item 1 beginning on page 13 of this report.We compete to raise capital in the equityand debt markets. See “Liquidity and Funding Risks” beginning on page 29 of this Item 1A for additional informationconcerning this risk. Risk from Economic Downturns andChanges Generally in an economic downturn our credit losses increase,demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquencies and creditlosses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressureon collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financialservices may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economicfactors that impact demand for loans andother financial products and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in interestrates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economicchange (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loanproduction levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin, and lower fees from transactions and services.Those effects can continue for many years after the downturn technically ends. Risks Associated with Monetary Events The Federal Reserve has implemented significant economicstrategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, asset values, and the shape of the yield curve, and currently is transitioningfrom many years of easing to what may be a slow or uneven, but extended, period of tightening. In recent years, in responseto the recession in 2008 and the following uneven recovery, the Federal Reserve implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives.Several of these have emphasized so-called quantitative easing strategies, the most recent of which ended during 2014. Other significantmonetary strategies could be implemented in the future including, in particular, so-called tightening strategies. Federal Reserve strategies can, and often are intended to,affect the domestic money supply, inflation, interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Effects on the yield curve oftenare most pronounced at the short end of the curve, which is of particular importance to us and other banks. Among other things,easing strategies are intended to lower interest rates, flatten the yield curve, expand the money supply, and stimulate economicactivity, while tightening strategies are intended to increase interest rates, steepen the yield curve, tighten the money supply,and restrain economic activity. Other things being equal, the current transition from easing to tightening should tend to diminishor reverse downward pressure on rates, and to diminish or eventually end the stimulus effect that low rates tend tohave on theeconomy. Many external factors may interfere with the effects of these plans or cause them to be changed unexpectedly. Such factorsinclude significant economic trends or events as well as significant international monetary policies and events. An example ofthe former is the substantial drop in oil prices experienced during 2015 and continuing in 2016. An example of the latter is therise in 2015 in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to many other currencies. Risks associated with interest rates and the yieldcurve are discussed in this Item 1A under the caption “Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks” beginning on page 30. Suchstrategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict. We may be adversely affected by economic and political situationsoutside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our customers, are linked significantly to economic and marketconditions outside the U.S., especially in North America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in Central and South America. Althoughwe have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or foreign sovereign debt, in the future major adverse eventsoutside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impactinclude (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/or corporate debt default,(iii) market and other liquidity disruptions,18and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapseof governments, alliances, or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affect usare highly varied but broadly include the following: an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailabilityof borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and othercounterparties; impacts upon our customers;impacts upon the U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflationrates; and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible politicalresponse to major financial disruptions. Strategic Risks We may be unable to successfully implement our strategy togrow our consumer and commercial banking businesses and our fixed income business. In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategyin response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions. In 2008 we sold our national mortgage platforms and closedour national lending operations. Since then we have closed a number of other units and renewed our emphasis on financial servicesin our traditional southeastern U.S. markets. The 2008 sale of the national mortgage platforms has contributed to significant declines in the amount of mortgage loans we originate and hold compared to earlier years. Similarly,sales of mortgage servicing assets and obligations have nearly eliminated assets associated with the legacy servicing business.At the end of 2015, loans within our non-strategic portfolio had declined to $2.0 billion. Although our current strategy is expected to evolve as businessconditions continue to change, at present our strategy is primarily to invest resources in our banking businesses and in our fixedincome business. Growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth inthe past three years has been largely organic but was enhanced by three acquisitions. In recent years we have enhanced our marketshare in our traditional banking markets with targeted hires and marketing, expanded into contiguous southeast U.S. markets withsimilar characteristics, and expanded with commercial lending and private client banking in the Houston, Texas market. In the future,we may rely more on acquisitions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves, butexpect to continue to nurture profitable organic growth as well. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy dependsupon a number of key elements, including: ●our ability to attract and retain customers in our banking market areas; ●our ability to achieve and maintain stability in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities;●in our fixed income business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same timeidentifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customersin the US and overseas; ●our ability to maintain a high level of customer service while reducing our physical branch count due to changing customerdemand, or while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructureseffectively and efficiently; ●our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with growth, especially organic growth and cash-fundedacquisitions; and ●our ability to manage effectively and efficiently the changes and adaptations necessitated by an increasingly complex and burdensomeregulatory environment which continues to evolve rapidly. We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elementsthat are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, asconditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions,we face various additional risks, including: ●our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisitionand to price the transaction appropriately; ●our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively; ●our ability to manage any operational or cultural assimilation risks associated with growth through acquisitions; ●our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and,19●our ability to retain core customers and key employees of the acquired company. One type of acquisition – a so-called “mergerof equals” where the company we nominally acquire has similar size, operating contribution, or value as we – presentsunique opportunities but also unique risks. Those special risks include: ●the potential for elevated and duplicative operating expenses if we are unable to integrate the two   companies efficiently ina reasonable amount of time; ●a significant increase in the time horizon that may be needed before any substantial economies of scale are realized; and, ●under current laws, the prospect of substantially increased regulatory burdens and costs if the combined company exceeds $50billion in asset size. RisksRelated to Businesses We Exit We may be unable to successfully implement the dispositionof businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We could have closures and divestitures as we continue to adaptto a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting a business include: ●our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms; ●our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negativeeffects on retained businesses; ●our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and ●our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of an exit that results in significantcash expenditures or a financial loss. Legacy Mortgage Business Risks We have significant risks from the mortgage-related businesseswe have exited, including mortgage loan repurchase and loss-reimbursement risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices, claimsof non-compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements, and higher default rates on loans made by our former businesses.In 2008 we exited our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses. However, we still retain as assets a significantamount of loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated acrossthe U.S. We retain the risk of liability to customers and contractual parties with whom we dealt in the course of operating thosebusinesses. These legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include: ●We have experienced elevated losses related to claims that we did not comply with contractual or other legal requirements whenwe sold mortgage loans. Losses at elevated levels may continue for some time to come. In 2008, we recognized expense related toobligations to repurchase loans of $29.5 million and that expense increased to $147.8 million in 2009 and $189.8 million in 2010before declining to $159.6 million in 2011. In 2012 and 2013 we recognized significant expense as a result of substantial settlementswith the two largest purchasers of our mortgages prior to 2009. Although our expenses related to these matters have declined substantially,further new information could be received in the future resulting in further adjustments related to exposures not covered by thesettlements. Our total repurchase and foreclosure provision expense was $299.3 million for 2012, $170.0 million for 2013, negative$4.3 million for 2014, and zero for 2015. ●We are defending several litigation matters associated with claims arising out of our former mortgage securitization activities.The outcome of those matters is uncertain and possible losses could be material. ●Although no such demand has yet been made of us, the trustee for those securitizations could demand repurchase of loans placedinto securitizations if we breached contractual requirements or obligations, or if we are obligated to indemnify the trustee. ●We have responded to investigations and inquiries by various parties, including government agencies, related to mortgage loanswe originated. Inquiries have been wide ranging. A few have led to litigation. One investigation, involving the FHA20insurance program, led to a settlement in 2015 of $212.5million. ●We could be subject to claims that foreclosures and other servicing-related actions taken by us, or on our behalf, were doneimproperly. ●Many of the loans on our books from our former national businesses have experienced significantly higher default and loss ratescompared to pre-recession years. Other trends adverse to us may emerge from this legacy business. Additional information concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them, allof which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth: under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-BalanceSheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations” beginning on page 57, “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability”beginning on page 61, and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 65 of the Management’s Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2015 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the captions “RPL-IncludedFirst Horizon Branded Mortgage Securitization Litigation Matters,” “First Horizon Branded Mortgage Securitization LitigationMatters,” and “Legacy Home Loan Sales and Servicing” in Note 17 – Contingencies and Other Disclosures beginningon pages 133, 133, and 134, respectively, which is part of the material from our 2015 Annual Report that has been incorporatedby reference into Item 8 of this report. Although we sold our mortgage servicing business and manyof our servicing assets in 2008, we have significant exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligations and assets which weretained after 2008, especially in relation to the subservicing arrangements we made between 2008 and the sale of substantiallyall our remaining servicing assets which we completed in 2014. Government authorities have announced substantial mortgage-related settlementswith major U.S. and foreign banks. Regulations pertaining to servicing have been changed, imposing stricter duties andstandards upon servicers.  State or federal inquiries or investigations into our servicing and foreclosureactivities may be commenced. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries, actions, or regulatory changes or theimpact that they could have on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.When we sold our origination and servicing businesses in2008 we retained significant servicing obligations and assets. At that time we engaged as our subservicer the purchaser ofour business. In 2011 that engagement expired and we engaged a new subservicer. Our 2008 subservicer experienced significantlosses in connection with its servicing business. Our 2008 subservicer has informed us that it expects us to reimburse it fora significant portion of its losses and costs under our subservicing agreement. We disagree with our 2008 subservicer’sposition and have made no reimbursements. We also believe that certain amounts billed us by agencies for penalties andcurtailments of claims by the subservicer prior to the 2011 subservicing transfer but billed after that date are owed by thesubservicer. This disagreement has the potential to result in litigation and, in any such future litigation, the claimagainst us may be substantial. Additional information concerning risks related to servicingand foreclosure practices and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is setforth: under the captions “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 61, “Foreclosure Practices”beginning on page 63, and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 65 of the Management’s Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2015 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption “Servicing andForeclosure Exposures” in Note 17 – Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 137 of our 2015 Annual Report,which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Several large purchasers of mortgage-backed securities havefiled suits against the trustees for those securitizations asserting new theories of liability. The trustee of our securitizationsis one of the defendants in such a suit, and many of our securitizations are among those alleged to have been purchased by theplaintiffs. The claims for damages are based in part on allegations that the trustee did not properly or timely act against theoriginators of the21securitizations or the servicers of the loans, and further assertthat the trustee had affirmative duties to act which were not set forth in the legal trust documents. Some of the legal theoriesadvanced are untested or unsettled. Although we are not a defendant in these proceedings, these complex suits may progress or evolveso as to compel us to defend ourselves or our trustee, and could create financial exposure for us. We have elevated loss exposures associated with past lendingunder various government programs. Like most banks we have participated for many years in government-sponsored lending programs.At the federal level, during the period before we sold our national mortgage origination and servicing businesses, two prominentprograms for us were the FHA and VA mortgage lending programs. Those programs require lenders like us to comply with various requirementsin originating the loans. Non-compliance can lead to an agency demand that the lender reimburse resulting losses. An agency also could demand enhanced damages, including trebledamages, under various federal laws. A number of federal laws, including the False Claims Act, provide for substantial recoveriesand penalties if false information is provided to a federal agency, and also provide that private citizens may sue in the nameof the agency and obtain a portion of any recovery as a bounty. Some of these laws provide legal avenues for a wide variety ofgovernmental agency claims, while others can have a narrower focus but include non-governmental claims. In some cases the lawsprovide for bounties if the government agency obtains a recovery. It is possible that suits under the False Claims Act or anotherlaw may be brought regarding our past financial business activities, such as mortgage originations, sales, securitizations, orservicing, either by a federal agency, by another party to those activities, or by an unrelated private person interested in pursuingthe bounty. In 2012 we settled a private action of that sort related to a portion of our past VA lending, and in 2015 we settledwith government agencies regarding our FHA lending. Currently we are defending another private action of that sort on appeal, havingobtained a dismissal of the case in the lower court. Additional information concerning these government program risks,all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth under the caption “Legacy Home Loan Salesand Servicing” in Note 17 – Contingencies and Other Disclosures beginning on page 134 of our 2015 Annual Report, whichis part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Reputation Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtainand retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and our financial stability.Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how thosepractices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industryas a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have importantrelationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment,and management.Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to accessthe capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones,could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our abilityto attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry,may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change or constrainour business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk. Credit Risks We face the risk that our customers may not repay theirloans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risks that othercounterparties, in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of creditcharge-offs isunavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary over time. Since 2007 our credit charge-offs, especiallyrelated to lending, increased to historically high levels. Net charge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007, and increased to $572.8million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginning in222010, net charge-offs began to decline, reaching $48.4 millionin 2014 and $31.2 million in 2015. In recent years, our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels. The allowance forloan loss was $210.2 million as of December 31, 2015, down substantially from $896.9 million and $849.2 million at year-end 2009and 2008, respectively. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon ourability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral, including realestate among other things. We further manage lending credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity,and by recording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicableaccounting rules. We further manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other partsof this Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty. We record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting andregulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption “Accounting Risks” beginning on page31, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to increase, or to be recognized on an acceleratedbasis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC or PCAOB could take accountingpositions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other bankingregulators. A significant challenge for us is to keep the credit and othermodels and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment,in real estate prices and other collateral values, in the economy, and in the regulatory environment, among other things, basedon our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years we have changed our models and approaches basedon changes in circumstances, and we will continue to do so as conditions change. At times those changes have had significant impactsupon our reported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfoliosand lending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our managementdecisions could be misguided or otherwise adversely affected with substantial adverse consequences to us. A significant subset of our home equity lines of credit wereoriginated prior to our national platform sale in2008. A large number of those loans will be switching in the next few years frominterest-only payments to full amortization payments (principal and interest combined). In reserving for potential loss in thisportfolio we model an increased rate of default associated with the higher monthly payment requirements when that switch occurs.Our modeling is based, among other things, on our experience with this portfolio, but risk remains that actual default rates couldexceed our modeling. The prolonged low-interest rate environment has created achallenge for us and other banks to balance taking on higher risk against the need for income or yield. This challenge appliesnot only to credit risk in our lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding our investments which, as they mature,are reinvested at current rates. The composition of our loan portfolio inherently increasesour sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2015, approximately 59% of total loans consisted of the commercial,financial, and industrial (C&I) category, while approximately 27% consisted of the consumer real estate category. The largest component of the C&I category at year end wasloans to finance and insurance companies, a component which represented about 21% of the C&I category at that time. The secondlargest component was loans to mortgage companies. As a result, approximately 37% of the C&I category was sensitive to impactson the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A with respect to our company, the financial servicesindustry is more sensitive to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy, changes in real estateand other asset values, and changes in general economic conditions, than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industrycould dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts for the loans in our portfolio. The consumer real estate category contains a number of concentrationswhich affect credit risk assessment of the category. ●Product concentration. The consumer real estate category consists primarily of home equity lines of credit, and muchof the remainder consists of consumer installment loans. ●Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate.Approximately 38% of the category consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis. ●Geographic concentration. At year end about 64% of the category related to Tennessee customers,23   7% related to California, and no other state representedmore than 3% of the category.   ●Legacy concentration. A significant part of the consumer category still consists of loans originated before 2009 byour legacy national mortgage lending business. Those are loans we originated and did not sell and loans we have repurchased inthe course of resolving repurchase claims with loan buyers. Our legacy loans have been shrinking in recent years, but remain substantial. The consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economicimpacts on consumer customers and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significantlife events such as divorce, death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, in the currentenvironment regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer categoryand our accounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types. Our exposure to the volatile oil & gas industry is modestbut growing. Our Houston office, opened in 2014, specializes in commercial lending and private banking. Commercial lendingin that office significantly focuses on three categories: energy, commercial real estate (CRE), and commercial, financial, &industrial (C&I). Much of our Houston business is connected, at least in part, to the energy industry, especially oil and gasproduction and distribution. Although at year-end the amount of total loans outstanding in the Houston office were financiallysmall in relation to our total loan portfolio, our Houston office is new and growing. In addition to general credit and other risksmentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, the energy business and related assets are sensitive to a number of factors specific to thatindustry. Key among those is global demand for energy and other products from oil and gas in relation to supply. Starting in late2014 and continuing (to date) into early 2016, oil prices have fallen substantially, putting financial pressure on businesses inthat industry, especially highly leveraged businesses. Although there was little financial impact from that price decline on ouroverall loan business at year-end, continued volatility in oil prices might impact the future financial performance and growthof our Houston-based lending business. Additional information concerning credit risks and our managementof them is set forth under the captions “Asset Quality—Trend Analysis of 2015 Compared to 2014” beginning onpage 26, “Credit Risk Management” beginning on page 51, and “Allowance for Loan Losses” beginning on page64 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2015 AnnualReport, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. Operational Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependentin part upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure,manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arisein many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes;faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and relatedsecurity breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequaciesmay present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, informationtechnology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficientlyadaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable.Also, ourefforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us, increases our operational challenges as we striveto maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost. A serious information technology security (cybersecurity)breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, thatdamage can occur due to outright theft of funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers, or adverse publicity associatedwith a breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certain vendors, all of whomlegitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentiallyvery serious consequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades need to address internal and externalsecurity concerns to a high degree, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining tobank safety and customer protection. Although many24of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others aremuch older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft,and other electronic crimes, and we educate our customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications.We expect our systems and regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue toevolve. The operational functions we outsource to third partiesmay experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in somecases, limited ability to obtain quickly an alternate vendor. To the extent we rely on third party vendors to perform orassist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult. The operational functions of business counterparties mayexperience disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control. For example, in recentyears several major U.S. retailers experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit and debit cardinformation, online account information, and other financial data of millions of customers. Retailer incursions affect cards issuedand deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Although our systems are not breached in retailer incursions,these events can cause us to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costly steps to avoid significant theft lossto our Bank and our customers, and our ability to recoup our losses may be limited legally or practically in many situations. Otherpossible points of incursion or disruption not within our control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers,social media portals, distant-server (“cloud”) service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunicationscompanies, and smart phone manufacturers. Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure,failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructurecomponents suffer damage, can leadto risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicable regulatorystandards. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated intothis Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “Operational Risk Management” beginning on page 51 of theManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2015 Annual Report,which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. The delivery of financial services to customers and othersincreasingly depends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating or enhancing several risksdiscussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoption of relatively untestedtechnologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claims of patent or other intellectualproperty infringement. Competition for talent is substantial and increasing.The primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission, incentive, and retention compensation programs;retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and our corporate culture. To theextent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we willbe unable to replace those persons effectively. Incentives might operate poorly or have unintended adverseeffects. Incentive programs are difficult to design well, and even if well-designed often they must be updated to address changesin our business. A poorly designed incentive program – where goals are too difficult, too easy, or not well related to desiredoutcomes – could provide little useful motivation to key employees, could increase turnover, and could impact customer retention.Moreover, even where those pitfalls are avoided, incentive programs may create unintended adverse consequences. For example, aprogram focused entirely on revenue production, without proper controls, may result in costs growing faster than revenues. Service Risks We provide a wide range of servicesto customers, and the provision of these services may create claims against us that we providedthem in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules. Ourservices include lending, fiduciary, custodial,depositary, funds management, and advisory services, amongothers. We manage these risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Additionalinformation concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this25reference, appears under the captions“Operational Risk Management” and “Compliance Risk Management”, both beginning on page 51 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations section of our 2015 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. Regulatory, Legislative, and LegalRisks The regulatory environment is challenging, and the regulatoryimpacts on us have become more restrictive and more costly. We operate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environmenthas changed significantly in the past ten years, and our regulatory burdens generally have increased, as a result of macro eventsaffecting traditional banking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. Heightened levels of regulatory change are likelyto continue for at least the next several years. We are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securitiesbrokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly tradedin the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulationscould result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations mayincrease our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See “Supervision and Regulation”in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 5, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal andstate regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition,we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areasof employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changingthese regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could furtherrestrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the products and serviceswe offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also couldexpand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customerinformation and increasing our costs. The following paragraphs highlight certain specific importantrisk areas related to regulatory matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively, and they do notdescribe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance ofspecific risks will grow or diminish as circumstanceschange. We and our Bank both are required to maintain certain regulatorycapital levels and ratios. Those requirements have increased recently. In 2013 regulators adopted enhancements to U.S. capitalstandards based on international standards known as “Basel III.” The revised standards emphasize Common Equity Tier1 Capital, restrict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and make more stringent the methodology for calculatingrisk-weighted assets. The revised standards began to apply to us January 1, 2015. The old (2014) and new (2015) standards are discussedin Item 1 of this report above, in tabular and narrative form, under the caption “Capital Adequacy” starting on page7. Pressures to maintain appropriate capital levels and addressbusiness needs in a persistently weak economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to our shareholders.Such actions that have occurred in the past ten years include the elimination in 2008 of our twenty cents per share quarterly commoncash dividend (which was reinstated at one cent per share in 2011, has since been increased three times, and will be seven centsstarting April 2016) along with two sales of our common stock and the issuance of a common stock warrant. Other such actions couldinclude the issuance of participating preferred stock, securities convertible into common or participating stock, or the issuanceof any class of stock having rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of common or preferred stock. Additional information concerning these risks and ourmanagement of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions“Capital Adequacy” and “Prompt Corrective Action (PCA)” in Item 1 of this report beginning on pages 7and 8, respectively; under the captions “Capital - 2015 Compared to 2014,” “Capital Managementand Adequacy,” and “Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends” beginning on pages 23, 51, and 63, respectively,of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2015Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of thisreport; and under the caption “Regulatory Capital” in Note 12 – Regulatory Capital and Restrictions,beginning on page26123 of our 2015 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference intoItem 8 of this report. We are required to conduct and submit annual stress tests,the outcomes of which could further increase our capital requirements and could damage our ability to obtain credit and our reputation.Stress testing processes require banks to estimate the impact on capital, liquidity, and other measures of safety of certain assumedenvironmental shocks. A failure to satisfy regulatory stress testing, or another significant risk management standard, could resultin the imposition of operating restrictions on us and require us to raise capital, which could adversely affect operating resultsor be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, a summary of a portion of the stress results must be made public. A poor resultcould impact our ability to borrow funds and our reputation generally. New regulatory initiatives under Dodd-Frank and otherwisemay have unintended adverse impacts upon us or the industry. For example, stress testing includes “rate shocks”which model the financial impact of sudden large increases in market interest rates upon us. In practical effect this encouragesbanks to shorten the “duration” of their assets (loans and investments), discouraging long-term assets. Shorteningduration should improve a bank’s ability to withstand a very large rate shock. However, it also can reduce the effectiveyield a bank receives from its assets, which would put downward pressure on revenues, margins, and earnings. Legal disputes are an unavoidable part of business; the outcomeof litigation cannot be predicted with any certainty. We face the risk of litigation from customers, employees, vendors, contractualparties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or state regulators. We manage those risks throughinternal controls, personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means.However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with any certainty. Typically we are unable to estimate our loss exposure fromclaims against us until relatively latein the litigation process, which can make our financial recognition of loss from litigationunpredictable and highly uneven from one period to the next. Currently we are defending a number of legal matters. For mostof them we have established either no reserve or no significant reserve. Financial accounting guidance requires that litigationloss be both estimable and probable before a reserve may be established (recorded as a liability on our balance sheet). For mostlitigation matters, under that guidance reserves typically are not established until after preliminary motions to dismiss or narrowthe case are resolved, after discovery is substantially in process, and (in many cases) after preliminary overtures regarding settlementhave occurred. Potentially significant cases often are pending for years before any loss is recognized and a reserve is established.Moreover, it is not uncommon for a case to experience relatively little progress toward resolution for a long period followed bya brief period of rapid development. Lastly, although most cases are resolved with little or no loss to us, for the others losstypically is recognized either all at once (near the time of resolution) or very unevenly over the life of the case. Additional information concerning litigation risks and our managementof them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the caption “Legacy Mortgage BusinessRisks” beginning on page 20 of this report; under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements,and Other Contractual Obligations,” “Repurchase and ForeclosureLiability,” “Market Uncertainties and Prospective Trends,” and “Contingent Liabilities” beginning on pages 57, 61, 63, and 68, respectively, of the Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2015 Annual Report, which is part of thematerial from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report; and under the caption “Contingencies”in Note 17 – Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 132 of our 2015 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of this report. Risks of Expense Control  Our ability to successfully manage expenses is importantto our long-term survival and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many factors can influence theamount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As ourbusinesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additionalexpenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, amongother things. The importance of managing expenses has been amplified27in the current slow growth, low net interest margin businessenvironment. Overall, our noninterest expenses havebeen improving: in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 noninterest expense was $1,276.5 million, $1,369.5 million, $1,148.5 million,$832.5 million, and $1,053.8 million, respectively.  Volatility in noninterest expense has been significantly affected byincreasingly idiosyncratic charges related to legacy mortgage activities as discussed in this Item 1A under the caption “LegacyMortgage Business Risks” beginning on page 20. We manage controllable expenses and risk through a variety ofmeans, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes. In recentyears we have actively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking andright-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce and incentive programs. These efforts usuallyentail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovation costs,and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future.  We have also re-focused our attention on the economic profitgenerated by our business activities and prospects rather than merely revenues or ordinary profit. Economic profit analysis attemptsto relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher (more efficient) returnson capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profit analysis. The processis intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment of our resources. Economic profit analysis involves a significantamount of judgment regarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocation of resources and diminishedprofitability over the long run. Geographic Risks We are subject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions.To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarilyimpact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If the southeastern U.S., and Tennessee inparticular, were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degreenot shared by those competitors which have a broader footprint. We have international assets in the form of loans and lettersof credit. Holding non-U.S assets creates a number of risks:  the risk that taxes, fees, prohibitions, and other barriersand constraints may be created orincreased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our holdings; the risk that currencyexchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollarvalue of liabilities; and the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways. Our abilityto manage those and other risks depends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differencesin legal, cultural, and other expectations applicable to customers, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties;and our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed.  Insurance Our property and casualty insurance may not cover or maybe inadequate to cover the risks that we face, and we are or may be adversely affected by a default by the insurers that provideus mortgage and bank-owned life insurance.  We use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damageor destruction of property as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situationour insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured, wealso face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat theformer risk as a type of credit risk,which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to use more than oneinsurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractualsituation. A portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage defaultinsurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adverselyaffect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provisionor write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financialresults. In recent28years events of this sort have happened. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvencyat the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified. We own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assetson our books. Some of those policies are “general account” and others are “separate account.” The generalaccount policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separateaccount policies areless susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higher risk of value fluctuations in securities which underliethose policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying security values. However, particularlyfor the general account policies, our ability to liquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantlylimited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon earlypolicy termination. Liquidity and Funding Risks Liquidity is essential to our business model and a lack ofliquidity or an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses, results of operations, financialconditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and, therefore,can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2014 and 2015 were met principally by deposits,by financing from other financial institutions, and by funds obtained from the capital markets. Deposits traditionally have provided our most affordable fundsand by far the largest portion of funding. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. If the economy improvesor market rates rise, deposit levels in our Bank might fall, perhaps fairly quickly, as depositors become more comfortable withrisk and seek higher returns in other vehicles. This could pressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink our net interestmargin to the extent that loan rates do not rise correspondingly and at the same time. The market among banks for deposits may be impacted as a resultof the relatively new Basel III capital rules. Those rules generally provide favorable treatment for core deposits. Moreover, institutionswith more than $50 billion of assets are required to maintain a minimum Liquidity Coverage ratio. Larger banks covered by thisrule may be incented to compete for core deposits to an unexpected extent. Although smaller banks, like ours, are not directlyimpacted by this rule, if some large banks in our markets take aggressive actions we could lose deposit share or be compelled toadjust our deposit pricing and practices in ways that could increase our costs.We also depend upon financing from private institutional orother investors by means of the capital markets. In 2014 we issued $400 million of senior bank notes due 2019, and in 2015 we issued$500 million of senior notes due 2020. The 2015 notes refinanced an earlier five-year notes issue. Presently we believe we couldaccess the capital markets again if we desired to do so. Risk remains, however, that capital markets may become unavailable tous for reasons beyond our control. A number of more general factors could make funding moredifficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results,organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners,disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterpartyavailability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure,interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, andtax environments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by thegeneral state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S.government and its agencies, and may remain or become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond ourcontrol. Events affecting interest rates, markets, and other factorsmay adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our fixed income business.  As a result, disruptionsin those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings directly affect the availability and costof our unsecured funding. The Corporationand the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating agencies for unsecuredborrowings. A rating29below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debtrating of Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings,is considered investment grade for many purposes. In recent years we have experienced downgrades and upgrades by the various agenciesat various times. At December 31, 2015, two of the three rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation asinvestment grade, and all three rated such debt of the Bank as investment grade, although we were at or near the lowest levelsof investment grade. The ratings outlook from one of the ratings agencies was positive, and from the other two was stable, for both the Corporation and the Bank. To theextent that in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experiencereduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered belowinvestment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thuscan adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please notethat a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, orhold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time,and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Reductions in our credit ratings could allow counterpartiesto terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additional collateralwith respect to certain derivatives agreements. At this time, those of our ISDA master agreements which have ratings triggersreference the lower of S&P’s or Moody’s ratings. Based on those ratings, for some time we have been requiredto post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties. Should a creditrating downgrade occur, the maximum additional collateral we would have been required to post is approximately $1 million as of December 31, 2015. Reductions in our credit ratings could result in counterpartiesreducing or terminating their relationships with us. Some parties with whom we do business may have internal policies restrictingthe business that can be done with financial institutions, such as the Bank, that have credit ratings lower than a certain threshold. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks We are subject to interest rate risk as a significant portionof our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues andexpenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control therisks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. A flat or inverted yield curve may reduce our net interestmargin and adversely affect our lending and fixed income businesses. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicableto short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-termrates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yieldcurve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flator inverted for short or even protractedperiods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lending businesses,and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of our fixed income business.A goal and effect of certain actions by the Federal Reserve over the past few years has been to flatten the yield curve, and ournet interest margin has declined over this period. Expectations by the market regarding the direction of futureinterest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact the revenues of our fixed incomebusiness. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, orwhen expectations are especially weak or uncertain. Securities Inventories and MarketRisks The trading securities inventories we hold in our fixed incomebusiness are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold trading securities inventory positionsfor purposes of distributions to customers, and we are exposed tocertain market risks attributable principally to credit riskand interest rate risk associated with fixed-income securities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities throughcertain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example,30hedging activities and Value-at-Risk(“VaR”) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. Fixed income trading securities (long positions)were $.9 billion at year-end 2015, $1.2 billion at year-end 2014, and $.8 billion at year-end 2013. Trading liabilities(short positions) were $100.0 million, $594.3 million, and $368.3 million at December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A bythis reference, appears under the caption “Market Risk Management” beginning on page 49 of the Management’sDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2015 Annual Report, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of this report. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in marketsor market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income related to our brokeragebusiness and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market pricescan adversely affect those revenue sources. Significant changes to the securities market’s performancecan have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number of assets and obligationsthat are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have a materialimpact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. An example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pensionplan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. To a substantial extent the pension plan invests its assets in marketablesecurities, primarily fixed income but also equities. Our pension funding obligations generally depend upon actuarial estimatesof benefits claims, the discount rate used to estimate the present values of those claims, and actuarial estimates of future planasset values. Our obligations to fund the plan can be affected by changes in any of those three factors. Accordingly, our obligationsdiminish if the plan’s investments perform well or if estimates are changed anticipating better performance,and can growif those investments perform poorly or if expectations worsen. A rise in interest rates is likely to negatively impact the valuesof fixed income assets held in the plan, would result in an increase in the discount rate used, and also could negatively impactthe stock market generally. Similarly, our obligations can be impacted by changes in mortality tables or other actuarial inputs. Changes in our funding obligation generally translate into positiveor negative changes in our pension expense over time, which in turn affects our financial performance. Although our obligationsand expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employee populationand changes to the plan itself, declines in market performance tend to increase our obligations to fund the pension plan. Althoughwe have taken actions intended to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable.That risk of volatility would be amplified if certain actuarial assumptions change adversely, especially the discount rate usedto estimate the projected benefit obligation, or if the accounting rules regarding pension liability estimates change adversely. Our hedging activities may be ineffective, may not adequatelyhedge our risks and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to create partial or fulleconomic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. For example: our fixed income unit manages interest rate risk on aportion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts; and, we use derivatives, including swaps,swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interest rateschange. Generally, in the latter example these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk thatthe other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the riskthat the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failurecould have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Accounting Risks The preparation of our consolidated financialstatements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimatesthat affect the financial statements. The estimate that is consistently one of our most critical is the level of theallowance forcredit losses.  However,other estimates can be highly significant at discrete times or during periods of varying length. Currently those include:the level of reserves for loan repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure losses; the valuation of our deferred tax assets; andthe valuation of our goodwill. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are31adjusted accordingly. Due to theinherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we may significantly increase the allowancefor credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize asignificant provision for impairment of our goodwill or other assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materiallyfrom the estimates that we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matterswhere critical information is inadequate, we are entirely unable to make estimates until fairly late in a lengthy process. Welack first-hand visibility regarding certain loans, other assets, or liabilities which increases the risk that our estimates maybe inaccurate. For example, interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and lines of credit secured byjunior liens on 1-4 family residential properties requires that the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessingthe collectability and inherent loss of a performing junior lien. Additionally, the OCC has clarified that an institution’sincome recognition policy should incorporate management’s consideration of all reasonably available information including,for junior liens, the performance of the associated senior liens as well as trends in other credit quality indicators. We own andservice a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed of home equity lines and installment loans. As of December31, 2015, that amount was $4.8 billion. As of December 31, 2015, approximately $1.7 billion or 35 percentof the consumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone second liens. We own or service approximately 8 percent of the first liens that are senior to these stand-alone second liens. We are not able to actively monitor the performancestatus of the first liens that are serviced by others. We obtain first lien performance information from third parties and throughloss mitigation activities, and we place a stand-alone secondlien loan on nonaccrual if we discover that there are performanceissues with the first lien loan. It is possible that if our evaluation methods change or information sources otherwise improveour additions to nonperforming loans may be material.  A reduction in our taxable earnings outlook could adverselyaffect the value of our deferred tax asset, as could a reduction in our corporate income tax rate. We have a net deferred taxasset accumulated during recent years. At December 31, 2015 our gross deferred tax asset after valuation allowance was approximately$352.6 million and the net deferred tax asset was approximately $259.3 million. The valueof our deferred tax asset depends in part upon our estimation of our ability to realize the asset during applicable future periodsand upon our estimate of our effective tax rate. A significant adverse change in our taxable earnings outlook could result in animpairment of the value of our deferred tax asset. Also, U.S. federal or state tax rate reductions could result in impairment. Changes in accounting rules can significantly affect howwe record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affect all companiesin a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or businessoperations of companies within the same industry. Changes in regulatory rules can create significant accountingimpacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports based on regulatory accountingrules. Changes in those rules can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition, such changescan impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can create uncertainties in our financialreporting. Risks of Holding our Stock  The principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on ourstock is dividends and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank cannot currently pay dividends to us without regulatory approval.We primarily depend upon common dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our common and preferred stockholders.Regulatory constraints may prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to us in 2016 without regulatory approval. Applyingthe applicable regulatory rules, as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Bank had negative $192.8 million and negative $75.7 million,respectively, available for dividends. On January 1, 2016, the Bank’s total amountavailable for dividends was negative $142.0million. That amount will improve during 2016 only to the extent that the Bank’s earnings for the year exceed preferred and anycommon dividends for the year. Also, we are required to provide financial support to the Bank.Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore would be unavailable fordividends. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policystatements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of current operating earnings.The32Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a general mattera bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) thebank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paidduring that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company’s prospective rateof earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospective financialcondition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capitaladequacy ratios. Our stockholders may suffer dilution if we raise capitalthrough public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. Ifwe raise funds by issuing equity securitiesor instruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentage ownershipof our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferences superior to thoseof our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutive to current stockholders.We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutive to stockholders. Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions of ourcharter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraginga third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders.    "

Forward-lookingstatements are not a recitation of historical information, but instead pertain to future operations, strategies, financial resultsor other developments. The words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,”“should,” “is likely,” “will,” “going forward,” and other expressions that indicatefuture events and trends identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements arenecessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economicand competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control, and many of which, with respect tofuture business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples ofuncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: global, general, and local economic and businessconditions, including economic recession or depression; the level and length of deterioration in the residential housing andcommercial real estate markets; potential requirements for us to repurchase previously sold or securitized mortgages orsecurities based on such mortgages; potential claims relating to the foreclosure process; potential claims relating toparticipation in government programs, especially lending or other financial services programs; expectations of and actualtiming and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope and shape of the yield curve, which can have a significantimpact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage markets;inflation or deflation; customer, investor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; thefinancial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry;geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of ourhedging practices; technological changes; fraud, theft, or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other meansaffecting us directly or affecting our customers or business counterparties; demand for our product offerings; newproducts and services in the industries in which we operate; the increasing use of new technologies to interact withcustomers and others; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, servicing,and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing andother real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions ofthe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry RegulatoryAuthority (FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (Bureau), theFinancial Stability Oversight Council (Council), and other regulators and agencies; pending, threatened, or possible futureregulatory, administrative, and judicial outcomes, actions, and proceedings; changes in laws and regulations applicable tous; and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, couldcause actual results to differ, perhaps materially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements. We assume no obligation to update or revise,whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, any forward-looking statements that are made in our 2013 AnnualReport or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations couldchange, possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those factors listed above or presented below, in otherItems of this report, or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report, including our 2013 AnnualReport, should carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item 1A below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statementsand assessing our prospects.21Competition Risks We are subject to intense competitionfor customers. Our primary areas of competition for customers include: retail and commercial deposits and bankloans, wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages and lines of credit, capital markets products andservices, and other consumer and business financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state,and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counselingfirms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedgefunds, and other financial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. Some competitors are banks, subject to thesame regulatory regime as we, while others are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degreeof regulation. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services.Heightened competition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing and other promotionalcosts, or both. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to the “Competition” headingof Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 17 of this report. We compete to raise capitalin the equity and debt markets. See “Liquidity and Funding Risks” beginning on page 39 of this Item 1A for additionalinformation concerning this risk. We compete to hire, retain,and motivate our employees. The primary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission, incentive, andretention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change in control severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits;and our corporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively, we face the risk that, over time, our besttalent will leave us and we will be unable to replace those persons effectively. Risk from Economic Downturns and Changes Generally in an economic downturn ourcredit losses increase, demand for our products and services declines, and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines.Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems forcustomers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness), depositand other products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national,regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financial products and services. Such factors include,for example, changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economicdownturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance in the formof higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, compression of our net interest margin, and lower feesfrom transactions and services. Since 2007 our operating results havebeen adversely affected by such a weakness in the economy, the effects of which have significantly moderated but continue to befelt. Through December 31, 2013, we continued to experience overall credit quality improvement following the 2008-09 recession,but with volatility from quarter to quarter in some portfolios. Net charge-offs were $132 million in 2007, and increased to $573million and $832 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline. They were $324 millionin 2011, $185 million in 2012, and $78 million in 2013. Our provision for loan losses was $273 million in 2007 and it peaked at$1.1 billion in 2008. In 2009, the annual provision began to decline; it was $44 million in 2011, $78 million in 2012, and $55million in 2013. Approximately $23 million of the 2012 provision related to the implementation of a change in regulatory guidance.Nonperforming assets (“NPAs”) followed similar trends as the loan loss provision with the level of NPAs peaking in2008 and continuing to decline in 2013. We expect asset quality trends to be relatively 22stable in 2014. That expectationdepends upon a continued mild economic recovery, among other things, which may or may not occur. However, such trends may alsobe impacted by future regulatory guidance similar to that mentioned in this Item 1A under the caption “Accounting Risks”beginning on page 41. If the strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conductoperations in particular decline, that could result in, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality with correspondingadverse effects on our loan portfolio and loan loss provision. Risks Associated with Monetary Events The Federal Reserve has implemented significanteconomic strategies that have impacted interest rates, inflation, and the shape of the yield curve. In recent years the FederalReserve has implemented a series of domestic monetary initiatives in response to economic conditions. Several of these have emphasizedso-called quantitative easing strategies, the most recent of which currently is being slowly curtailed or “eased” onan indefinite timeframe. Other significant monetary strategies could be implemented in the future. Such strategies can, and oftenare intended to, affect the domestic money supply, inflation and interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve. Among otherthings, quantitative easing strategies are intended to create or maintain a low interest rate environment and to stimulate economicactivity; easing would diminish that downward pressure on rates and diminish that stimulus effect. Risks associated with interestrates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item 1A under the caption “Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks” beginningon page 40. Such strategies also can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficult to predict. We may be adversely affected by economicand political situations outside the U.S. The U.S. economy, and the businesses of many of our customers, are linked significantlyto economic and market conditions overseas, especially in North America, Europe, and Asia, and increasingly in Central and SouthAmerica. Although we have little direct exposure to non-US-dollar-denominated assets or foreign sovereign debt, in the futuremajor adverse events outside the U.S. could have a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events which couldhave such an impact include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more governments in their borrowings), (ii) bank and/orcorporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapseof governments, alliances, or currencies, and (v) military conflicts. The methods by which such events could adversely affectus are highly varied but broadly include the following: an increase in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailabilityof borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging and other counterparties; impacts upon our customers;impacts upon the U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estate values, interest rates, and inflation/deflationrates; and impacts upon us from our regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictably from possible politicalresponse to major financial disruptions. Strategic Objectives We may be unable to successfully implementour strategy to grow our consumer and commercial banking businesses and our capital markets business. In 2007 and 2008 we modifiedour strategy in response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditions. As part of this change in strategy, in 2008 wesold our national mortgage platforms, closed our national lending operations, and renewed our emphasis on financial services inour traditional southeastern U.S. markets in and around Tennessee. After 2008 we sold or closed units which did not perform orcomplement our strategy. The 2008 sale of the national mortgage platforms and closure of national lending have contributed to significantdeclines in the amount of loans we originate and hold. Similarly, sales of mortgage servicing from 2008 through first quarter 2014have, over that period, all but eliminated significant assets associated with that legacy business, including advances. From theend of 2008 to the end of 2013, loans within our non-strategic portfolio declined approximately 65 percent to $3.0 billion.23Although our current strategy is expectedto evolve as business conditions continue to change, at present our strategy’s primary components are to invest capital andother resources in our banking businesses and in our capital markets business. Growth is expected to be coordinated with a focuson stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in the past has been primarily organic rather than through substantialacquisitions. In recent years, we have enhanced our market share in our traditional banking markets and expanded into contiguousmarkets with similar characteristics. Most recently, we formally established our “Mid-Atlantic Region” which includesseveral markets outside of Tennessee and which is comprised of fewer, more narrowly focused branches and banking offices. In thefuture, we may rely more on acquisitions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves.We believe that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including: ●our ability to attract and retain customers in our banking market areas;●our ability to achieve and maintain stability in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities which, in the currentoperating environment, may emphasize customers that are predisposed to change their demand for our products quickly;●in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the sametime identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existingcustomers in the US and overseas;●our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing,technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;●our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth;●our ability to manage any operational, cultural, liquidity, or capital risks associated with growth through acquisitions; and●our ability to manage effectively and efficiently changes and adaptations necessitated by an increasingly complex and burdensomeregulatory environment which continues to evolve rapidly. We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elementsthat are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, asconditions change. To the extent we engage in bank or non-bankbusiness acquisitions, we face various risks associated with that practice, including: ●our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisitionand to price the transaction appropriately;●our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;●our ability to manage any operational, cultural, liquidity, or capital risks associated with growth through acquisitions;●our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and,●our ability to retain core customers and key employees of the acquired company. We may be unable to successfully implementthe disposition of businesses or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We have made several exit moves in recent yearsand could make others again as we continue to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks associated withexiting a business include: ●our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms;●our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negativeeffects on retained businesses;24●our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and●our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of an exit that results in significantcash expenditures or a financial loss. Risks Related to Exited Businesses We have significant risks from the businesseswe have exited, including mortgage loan repurchase risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices and higher default rates on loansmade by our former businesses. In 2008 we exited our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses. However,we retain as assets many of the loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other realestate situated across the U.S. In first quarter 2014 we substantially exited our legacy mortgage servicing business with a saleof most of our remaining mortgage servicing. We retain the risk of liability to customers and contractual parties with whom wedealt in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and obligations continue to impose risks on us. Key risksinclude: ●We have experienced elevated losses related to claims that we did not comply with                                                                                                             contractual                                                                                                              or                                                                                                             other legal requirements when we sold mortgage loans. Losses at elevated levels may continue for some time to come. In                                                                                                             2008, we recognized expense related to obligations to repurchase loans of $29.5 million and that expense increased to $147.8                                                                                                             million in 2009 and $189.8 million in 2010 before declining to $159.6 million in 2011. In  2012 and  2013 we recognized                                                                                                             significant expense as a result of  substantial settlements with the two largest purchasers of our mortgages prior to 2009.                                                                                                             Further                                                                                                              new                                                                                                             information could be received in the future, resulting in further adjustments related to exposures not covered by the settlements. Our                                                                                                             total repurchase and foreclosure provision expense was $299.3 million for 2012 and $170.0 million for 2013.●We are defending several litigation matters associated with claims arising out of our former mortgage securitization activities.The outcome of those matters is extremely uncertain and possible losses could be substantial. Moreover, although no such demandhas yet been made of us, the trustee for those securitizations could demand repurchase of loans placed into securitizations ifwe breached the contractual requirements made when the securitizations were created.●We have responded to investigations and inquiries by various parties, including government agencies, related to mortgage loanswe originated. Inquiries have been wide ranging. A few have led to litigation. One pending investigation involves the FHA insuranceprogram. Although no litigation or demand is pending the eventual outcome of this matter is unknown and could involve a substantialsum.●We could be subject to claims that foreclosures and other servicing-related actions taken by us, or on our behalf, were doneimproperly.●The consumer and commercial loans on our books from our former national specialty lending business have experienced significantlyhigher default and loss rates compared to pre-recession years. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured ona second-lien basis may have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults. Additional information concerning these risks appears in “LegacyMortgage Business Risks” beginning on page 26 of this Item 1A.Other trends adverse to us may emerge from these legacy assetsand positions as counterparties are stressed by economic conditions, both domestic and global, and of course some of these impactsapply to continuing businesses. Over time those losses and risks related to legacy items should diminish since those exited businesseswill not generate new loans and new contracts, but it is not possible to predict when that may occur.25Legacy Mortgage Business Risks Like many other financialinstitutions that originated and sold significant amounts of mortgage loans, we have experienced elevated exposure torepurchase obligations from entities which purchased mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from us. Prior to August2008, we originated loans through our legacy mortgage business, primarily first lien home loans, with the intention ofselling them. A substantial majority of such loans were sold to or guaranteed by government agencies (“Agencies”)or were sold to other purchasers. Two primary types of these sales occurred: so-called whole loan sales; and sales throughFirst Horizon branded proprietary securitizations. Whole loan sales were primarily to two Agencies but also were to otherpurchasers; in those cases we contracted with the buyers directly. The securities issued in the proprietary securitizationswere backed by the loans originated by our legacy mortgage business. Those securities were sold to many types of investors includingthe Agencies and federal home loan banks; in those cases we have contractual relationships with underwriters of thesecurities and with the trustees holding the loans, and we provided investors with information at the time of sale in theform of offering documents. In some cases the whole loans sold by us were in turn securitized by the purchaser. In some casesthe loans or securities were insured, as mentioned below, and in those cases we contracted with the insurers. As describedbelow, we retain risk of loss in connection with each of those past relationships, and that risk varies greatly with the typeof relationship. Although we conducted a significant mortgagebusiness dating back to the 1990s and we have had losses dating back at least to 2000, our continuing exposure to loss from thatbusiness primarily relates to the middle 2000s. From 2005 through 2008, we originated and sold $69.5 billion original principalamount of first lien mortgage loans in whole-loan transactions involving the Agencies. Of that, $57.6 billion was sold to two government-sponsoredenterprises (“GSEs”): Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan MortgageCorporation (“Freddie Mac”). The remainder was guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association (“GinnieMae”). Although additional GSE whole-loan sales occurred in earlier years, a significant majority of GSE repurchase requests(discussed below) have come from the 2005-8 period. In addition, from 2005 through 2007 we sold $26.7 billion original principalamount of first lien mortgage loans in First Horizon branded securitizations. Additional proprietary securitizations occurred inearlier periods, but the pending claims (discussed below) relate to those three years. We also securitized HELOC and second-lienloans in proprietary transactions (“HELOC securitizations”). Whole-loan purchasers have increased theirefforts to seek to require loan sellers to repurchase those loans or to reimburse purchasers for losses related to those loanswhen losses are incurred due to actual or alleged failure to strictly conform to the purchase contract representations or warranties.A substantial majority of our whole loan sales were to GSEs. The representations and warranties generally are broader for wholeloans sold to the GSEs and other purchasers than they are for the loans sold through our proprietary securitizations. GSE representationsand warranties claims typically include claims that loans had missing or insufficient file documentation or that loans were obtainedthrough fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers. As a result, we face pressure from whole-loan purchasersto repurchase those loans or to make the purchaser whole, and we face expenses to administer and resist such claims. In 2013 weagreed to a substantial settlement with one of the GSEs; although the settlement will reduce future repurchase requests from thatpurchaser, not all loan categories are covered by the settlement nor are other purchasers. For loans sold in proprietary securitizationswe have potential exposure for investment rescission or damages arising from legal claims that the offering documents under whichthe loans were securitized were materially deficient. As of December 31, 2013, we were a defendant in a total of five such lawsuits.Additionally, we have received various indemnity demands from underwriters for certain expenses and losses incurred in a totalof three other suits but have not been named a defendant. Other lawsuits or requests for indemnification may be brought in thefuture. There is also potential repurchase exposure and rescission26risk associated with our proprietary securitizationsunder the contracts with trustees through which the securitizations were created. Our securitization trustee could initiate arepurchase process on its own or at the behest of a sufficient percentage of securitization investors. However, the repurchaseprocess is more difficult for securitization investors to initiate than it is for GSEs in whole loan sales. At December 31, 2013,no such repurchase requests had been received with respect to our proprietary first-lien mortgage securitizations. At December31, 2013, based on applicable accounting guidance associated with contingencies, we had no reserve for potential losses associatedwith private first-lien mortgage securitizations except for one suit. The HELOC securitizations are creditenhanced, or “wrapped,” by a monoline insurance company. Contractual representations and warranties were made tothe monoline insurers, and we have received monoline insurer repurchase requests based on those contractual provisions. Amonoline insurer for one of these securitizations reportedly has become insolvent, and we are unable to estimate what, ifany, loss exposure that insolvency may create for us. Because of interests we retained, the loans held in our HELOCsecuritizations generally are recognized on our balance sheet as secured or restricted assets. Loss content for those loansis evaluated and recognized on our financial statements quarterly within the Allowance for Loan Losses. As a result, when werepurchase securitized HELOC loans the event typically has little immediate impact on our income statement. At December 31,2013, based on the information available and applicable accounting guidance, we had no reserve for potential lossesassociated with private HELOC securitizations other than the reserve within the Allowance for Loan Losses. The monolineinsurer for two of the HELOC securitizations has requested that, due to the default caused by unreimbursed insurance draws,the insurer and FHN should explore collapsing the trusts and purchasing the underlying collateral as a remedy. If that action were taken FHN could incur some incremental loss based upon the nature of thecollateral and the costs of collapsing the trusts. A significant portion of the loans we soldto GSEs were required to have private mortgage insurance (“MI”). MI also was provided for some of the loans in proprietarysecuritizations. We have received MI cancellation notices from the insurers which wrote these policies based on claims of fraudor misrepresentations relating to the insured loans. To date a majority of MI cancellations have involved loans sold to GSEs. Althoughunresolved MI cancellation notices are not formal repurchase requests, we include these in the active repurchase request pipelinewhen analyzing and estimating loss content in relation to the loans sold to GSEs. MI cancellations can result in repurchase requestsand, in the settlement mentioned above, MI-related repurchase requests are excluded from the settlement’s coverage. One MIinsurer involved with loans we sold reportedly has become insolvent. We do not expect its failure to create new exposure for us,but it will increase the amount of our loss associated with any related repurchases. The pipeline of repurchase requests, includingrelated unresolved MI cancellation notices as of December 31, 2013, 2012, 2011, and 2010 was $197.2 million, $333.8 million, $383.5million, and $534.2 million, respectively. During 2013 we entered into a settlement agreement with one of the GSEs. The settlementcovered many but not all obligations we have with that GSE. Because of the agreement, covered matters were removed from the pipeline,which impacted its balance at year-end. Our liability for repurchase losses is assessedquarterly. Although not all loans repurchased are in arrears or default, as a practical matter most have been. As a result, lossrecognition for repurchased loans as a group has been much higher than for consumer loans typically held in our portfolio. Also,although we re-evaluate our reserves for repurchase losses each quarter, evaluations of that sort necessarily are estimates andthere remains a risk that the reserves will not be adequate. Moreover, until second quarter 2012, our ability to estimate ourGSE repurchase exposure had been limited by our lack of access to relevant data regarding the underlying loans that we do notservice. That limitation resulted in volatility in our provision expense from quarter to quarter. In the second quarter of 2012we recognized $250 million of expense based on substantial new information received from one of the two GSEs. That informationallowed us, for the first time, to27estimate loss  over all GSE loans sold. The information we received from the GSE was updated  quarterly until we settled most of its whole-loan repurchase claims in fourth  quarter 2013. In February 2014 we settled most repurchase claims with the other  GSE. Future volatility should be less than in the past, though risk remains  with respect to loans not covered by the settlements and loans not sold to  GSEs. The liability (our reserve) for repurchase and foreclosure losses was  $165.1 million, $232.4 million, $165.3 million, and $182.9 million on December  31, 2013, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. While the vast majority of claims made todate relate to whole-loan sales to GSEs, claims have been made with respect to other purchasers and investors. Also, while thevolume in the repurchase pipeline has been falling, the proportion of non-GSE claims has grown. The number of repurchase requests,MI cancellation notices, or lawsuits may be volatile over time. An increase in the volume of such claims beyond what we are currentlyexperiencing, or an increase in the loss rate we experience upon resolution of these claims, could adversely affect our financialcondition and results of operations. Additional information concerning risksrelated to our former mortgage businesses and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by thisreference, is set forth: under the captions “Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and OtherContractual Obligations” beginning on page 51, “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 57,and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 62 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysisof Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of the material from thatreport that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report; and under the captions“RPL-Excluded First Horizon Branded Mortgage Securitization Litigation Matters,” “FirstHorizon Branded Mortgage Securitization Litigation Matters,” and “Legacy Home Loan Sales and Servicing” inNote 18 – Contingencies and Other Disclosures beginning on pages 134, 135, and 137, respectively, which is part of thematerial from our 2013 Annual Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of Part II of this report. Although we sold our mortgage servicingbusiness and many of our servicing assets in 2008, we have significant exposures related to the mortgage servicing obligationsand assets which we retained after 2008, especially in relation to the subservicing arrangements we made between 2008 and the saleof substantially all our remaining servicing assets which we completed in first quarter 2014. State and federal officials andregulators have announced and commenced inquiries and investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companiesand banks in completing affidavits relating to foreclosures and into the authority of the servicer to foreclose if assignmentsof legal interests in the mortgage loans have not been properly recorded. The attorneys general of all 50 states concluded a jointinvestigation of foreclosure practices across the industry and proposed significant changes in servicing practices related to foreclosuresand substantial penalties. In 2012 the Justice Department announced that the federal government and attorneys general of 49 stateshad reached a $25 billion settlement agreement with five of the largest servicers to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosureabuses. We were not a party to this settlement but the terms of it may affect later actions involving us. Government authoritiesin the past year have announced substantial mortgage-related settlements with major U.S. and foreign banks, and more settlementsare expected in 2014. The Bureau recently has adopted significant changes to servicing rules which are likely to increase the costand compliance risks of servicing mortgage loans. Additional state or federal inquiries or investigations may be commenced. Wecannot predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries, actions, or regulatory changes or the impact that they could have on ourfinancial condition, results of operations, or business. The OCC has issued supervisory guidanceregarding consumer foreclosure practices applicable to national banks, including our Bank. The guidance draws upon industry regulators’experience with 14 large mortgage servicing companies. Pursuant to the guidance our Bank conducted a self-assessment of its pastand present foreclosure practices, which was reported to the OCC. The guidance also requires our Bank to monitor its first-lienmortgage servicer and servicing vendors, to follow certain governance practices, and to28take corrective action regarding any deficiencies or weaknessesuncovered in the assessment. Corrective action includes remediation for customers who have experienced financial harm as a resultof such deficiencies. The ultimate financial impact to our Bank of this assessment and remediation process is unknown. When we sold our servicing business in 2008we retained significant servicing obligations and assets. At that time we engaged as our subservicer the purchaser of our business.In 2011 that engagement expired and we engaged a new subservicer. Our former subservicer experienced significant losses in connectionwith its servicing business based in part on the circumstances outlined above and in connection with a Consent Decree relatingto same with the OCC. In 2012 the subservicer entered into a settlement agreement with the OCC along with 13 other large mortgageservicers that replaced the Consent Decree and its foreclosure look-back process and requires remediation for all borrowers with“in process” foreclosures from 2009 – 2010. Our former subservicer has informed us that it expects us to reimburseit for a significant portion of its losses and costs under our subservicing agreement. We disagree with our former subservicer’sposition and have made no reimbursements. We also believe that certain amounts billed us by agencies for penalties and curtailmentsof claims by the subservicer prior to the subservicing transfer but billed after that date are owed by the subservicer. This disagreementhas the potential to result in litigation and, in any such future litigation, the claim against us may be substantial. Additional information concerning risks relatedto servicing and foreclosure practices and our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference,is set forth: under the captions “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 57, “Foreclosure Practices”beginning on page 60, and “Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability” beginning on page 62 of the Management’s Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report; and under the caption “Servicingand Foreclosure Practices” in Note 18 – Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 143 of our 2013 AnnualReport, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of Part II of this report. We also have elevated loss exposuresassociated with past lending under various government programs. Like most banks we have participated for many years in government-sponsoredlending programs. At the federal level, during the period before we sold our national mortgage origination and servicing businesses,two prominent programs for us were the FHA and VA mortgage lending programs. Those programs require lenders like us to comply withvarious requirements in originating the loans. Non-compliance can lead to an agency demand that the lender reimburse resultinglosses. An agency also could demand enhanceddamages, including treble damages, under various federal laws. A number of federal laws, including the False Claims Act,provide for substantial recoveries and penalties if false information is provided to a federal agency, and also provide thatprivate citizens may sue in the name of the agency and obtain a portion of any recovery as a bounty. Some of these lawsprovide legal avenues for a wide variety of governmental agency claims, while others can have a narrower focus but includenon-governmental claims. In some cases the laws provide for bounties if the government agency obtains a recovery. It ispossible that suits under the False Claims Act or another law may be brought regarding our past financial businessactivities, such as mortgage originations, sales, securitizations, or servicing, either by a federal agency, by another partyto those activities, or by an unrelated private person interested in pursuing the bounty. In 2012 we settled a private actionof that sort related to a portion of our past VA lending. Currently a government agency investigation of our FHA lendingsince January 1, 2006 is ongoing. Additional information concerning thesegovernment program risks, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forth under the captions “Inquiryregarding FHA-Insured Loans” and 29“Legacy Home Loan Sales and Servicing” in Note 18 – Contingencies andOther Disclosures beginning on pages 135 and 137,respectively, of our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of Part II of this report. Reputation Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses,and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and our financial stability.Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our business practices and how thosepractices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industryas a whole, also may adversely impact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom we have importantrelationships may adversely impact our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment,and management. Damage to our reputation could hinder ourability to access the capital markets or otherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customers andretain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and couldundermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputationof our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations thatchange or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigationrisk. Credit Risks We face the risk that our customers maynot repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We also face risksthat other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may fail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some levelof credit charge-offs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can vary over time. Since 2007 our credit charge-offs,especially related to lending, increased to historically high levels. Net charge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007, and increasedto $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009, respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline and reached$78.2 million in 2013. In recent years, our loan loss reserves also have declined from high levels. The allowance for loan losswas $253.8 million as of December 31, 2013, down substantially from $896.9 million and $849.2 million at year-end 2009 and 2008,respectively. Our ability to manage credit risks dependsprimarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value of any collateral,including real estate. We manage lending credit risk by attempting to diversify our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity,and by recording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicableaccounting rules. We manage other counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other parts ofthis Item 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any single counterparty. We record loan charge-offs in accordancewith accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption “Accounting Risks”beginning on page 41, these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense or charge-offs to increase, or to berecognized on an accelerated basis, for reasons not always related to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, theSEC could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the FederalReserve, OCC, or other banking regulators.30A significant challenge for us is to keep the creditand other models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment,in real estate prices and other collateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on our experience originatingloans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years we have changed our models and approaches based on changes in circumstances,and we will continue to do so as conditions change. At times those changes have had significant impacts upon our reported financialresults and condition. In addition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. Tothe extent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions couldbe misguided or otherwise adversely affected with substantial adverse consequences to us. For a significant component of our loanportfolios, specifically second-lien consumer real estate loans where we do not own or service the related first-lien loans, wehave lacked complete information on which to model loss content and to assess individual loan collectability. In that case thereis risk that our modeling and nonaccrual policies and procedures could be inadequate simply due to a lack of visibility into certainperformance data. In 2013 we were able to obtain more complete information about such first-lien loans to help mitigate this risk. A significant subset of our home equitylines of credit were originated prior to our national platform sale in 2008. An increasing number of those loans will switch inthe next few years from interest-only payments to full amortization payments (principal and interest combined). In reserving forpotential loss in this portfolio we model an increased rate of default associated with the higher monthly payment requirementswhen that switch occurs. Our modeling is based, among other things, on our experience with this portfolio, but risk remains thatactual default rates could exceed our modeling. The composition of our loan portfolioinherently increases our sensitivity to certain credit risks. At December 31, 2013, approximately 52% of total loans consistedof the commercial and industrial (C&I) category, while approximately 35% consisted of the consumer real estate category. Noother category exceeded 5% of total loans. The  largest component of the C&I categoryat year end was loans to finance and insurance companies, a component which grew  6% compared with 2012 and which represented about 22% of the C&I category  at December 31, 2013. The second largest component was loans to mortgage companies.  As a result, approximately 32% of the C&I category was sensitive to impacts  on the financial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A  with respect to our company, the financial services industry is more sensitive  to interest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy,  changes in real estate and other asset values, and changes in general economic  conditions than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industry could  dampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impacts  for the loans in our portfolio. The consumer real estate category containsa number of concentrations which affect credit risk assessment of the category. ●Product concentration. The consumer category consists primarily of home equity lines of credit, and much of the remainderconsists of consumer installment loans.●Collateral concentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Approximately 50% of the categoryconsists of loans secured on a second-lien basis.●Geographic concentration. At year end about 55% of the category related to Tennessee customers, 10% related to California,and no other state represented more than 3% of the category.●Legacy concentration. The consumer category is comprised in significant part of loans originated before 2009 by ourlegacy national mortgage lending business. Those loans consist of31loans we originated and did not sell and loans we have repurchased in the course of                                                                            resolving repurchase claims with loan buyers. The portfolio of legacy loans has been shrinking in recent years; however, it                                                                            remains a substantial portion of our overall portfolio. The consumer real estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumer customersand on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward job migration, as well as significant life events such as divorce,death, or disability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also, in the current environment regulatorychanges, discussed above and elsewhere in this Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer category and our accounting estimatesof credit loss than other loan types. Additional informationconcerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions “Asset Quality - Trend Analysis of2013 Compared to 2012” beginning on page 26, “Credit Risk Management” beginning on page 45, and“Allowance for Loan Losses” beginning on page 62 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations section of our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report thathas been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. The current prolonged low-interest rateenvironment has created a challenge for us and other banks to balance taking on higher risk against the need for income or yield.This challenge applies not only to credit risk in our lending activities but also to default and rate risks regarding our investmentswhich, as they mature, must be reinvested at current rates. Operational Risks Our ability to conduct and grow our businessesis dependent in part upon our ability to create, maintain, expand, and evolve an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure,manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arisein many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information technology, or other processes;faulty or disabled computer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and relatedsecurity breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequaciesmay present themselves in myriad ways. Actions taken to manage one risk may be ineffective against others. For example, informationtechnology systems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other major casualty, and they may be insufficientlyadaptable to new business conditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable.Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is a significant priority for us in the current business environment, increases ouroperational challenges as we strive to maintain customer service and compliance at high quality and low cost. A serious electronic security breachcan cause significant damage and at the same time be difficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damagecan occur due to outright theft of funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers, or adverse publicity associated withthe breach and its potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certain vendors, all of whom legitimatelyhave access to some portion of our systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentially very seriousconsequences associated with these risks, our electronic systems and their upgrades address internal and external security concerns to a higher degree than might be true of many companies in other industries, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertaining to bank safety and customer protection. Although many of our defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. For example, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flags associated with fraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we “train” our customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications. We expect our systems and the regulatory requirements to continue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.32The operational functionswe outsource to third parties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limitedcontrol and, in some cases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent we increase our relianceon third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes moredifficult. The operational functions of businesscounterparties may experience similar disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited or no control.For example, in 2013 major U.S. retailers experienced data systems incursions reportedly resulting in the thefts of credit anddebit card information, online account information, and other financial data of tens of millions of the retailers’ customers.Retailer incursions affect cards issued and deposit accounts maintained by many banks, including our Bank. Although our systemsare not breached in retailer incursions, these events can cause us to reissue a significant number of cards and take other costlysteps to avoid significant theft loss to our Bank and our customers. Other possible points of incursion or disruption not withinour control include internet service providers, electronic mail portal providers, social media portals, distant-server (“cloud”)service providers, electronic data security providers, telecommunications companies, and smart phone manufacturers. Failure to build and maintain the necessaryoperational infrastructure, failure of that infrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparedness plansif primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliancewith applicable laws or regulatory standards. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them,all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “Operational Risk Management”beginning on page 45 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations sectionof our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 ofPart II of this report. The delivery of financial services tocustomers and others increasingly depends upon technologies, systems, and multi-party infrastructures which are new, creating orenhancing several risks discussed elsewhere. Examples of the risks created or enhanced by the widespread and rapid adoptionof relatively untested technologies include: security incursions; operational malfunctions or other disruptions; and legal claimsof patent or other intellectual property infringement. Service Risks We provide a    wide range of services to customers, and the provision of these    services may create claims against us thatwe provided them in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party,or was not compliant with applicable lawsor rules. Our services include lending, fiduciary, custodial, depositary,funds management, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risksprimarily through training programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes.Additional information concerning these risks and our management of them, allof which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under thecaptions “Operational Risk Management” and “Compliance RiskManagement”, each beginning on page 45of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition andResults of Operations section of our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of thematerial from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report. Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks The regulatory environment is challenging,and the regulatory impacts on us have become more restrictive and more costly. We operate in a heavily regulated industry.The regulatory environment has been changing rapidly in recent years, and our regulatory burdens generally have been increasing,as a33 result of recent events affecting traditional banking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. Heightened levelsof regulatory change are likely to continue for at least the next several years. We are subject to many banking, deposit,insurance, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to all companiespublicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicableregulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulationsmay increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See “Supervision and Regulation”in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 5, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal andstate regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition,we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areasof employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changingthese regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could furtherrestrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or profitability of the products and serviceswe offer, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also couldexpand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customerinformation and increasing our costs. The following paragraphs highlight certainspecific important risk areas related to regulatory and legal matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risks exhaustively,and they do not describe all such risks that we face currently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminishas circumstances change. We and our Bank both are required to maintaincertain regulatory capital levels and ratios. Those requirements are increasing. In 2013 regulators adopted enhancements toU.S. capital standards based on international standards known as “Basel III.” The revised standards create a new emphasison Common Equity Tier 1 Capital, restrict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments, and make more stringent themethodology for calculating risk-weighted assets. The revised standards will begin to apply to us January 1, 2015. Since the standardsare new, a number of interpretive questions remain unresolved by the regulators. If  we were to incur financial losses persistently, or if the new regulatory requirements  are interpreted or otherwise applied in an unexpectedly adverse manner, then  at some point the ability of us or the Bank to meet applicable requirements  could be adversely affected. For us and the Bank, current regulations require  a Total Capital ratio of 8.00 percent and Tier 1 and Leverage ratios of 4.00  percent for capital adequacy purposes. As of December 31, 2013, our Total Capital  ratio was 16.23 percent, Tier 1 Capital ratio was 13.87 percent, and Leverage  ratio was 11.04 percent. For capital adequacy purposes the Bank must calculate  its capital ratios after excluding financial subsidiaries as defined by the  Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. Under such rules, as of December 31, 2013,  the Bank’s Total Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Leverage ratios were 16.84  percent, 15.43 percent, and 12.33 percent, respectively. Pressures to maintain appropriate capitallevels and address business needs in a persistently weak economy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverseto our shareholders. Such actions that have occurred in recent years include the elimination in 2008 of our twenty cents per sharequarterly common cash dividend (which was reinstated at one cent per share in 2011 and increased to five cents in 2013), two salesof our common stock and the issuance of a common stock warrant, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales or otherdispositions of assets or businesses) at times when market values were depressed. Other such actions could include the issuanceof participating preferred stock, securities34 convertible into common or participating stock, or the issuance of any class of stockhaving rights that are adverse to those of the holders of our existing classes of common or preferred stock. Additional information concerning these risksand our management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the captions “CapitalAdequacy” and “Prompt Corrective Action” in Item 1 of this report beginning on pages 8 and 12, respectively;under the captions “Capital,” “Capital Management and Adequacy,” and “Regulatory Matters” beginningon pages 23, 44, and 59, respectively, of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results ofOperations section of our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by referenceinto Item 7 of Part II of this report; and under the caption “Regulatory Capital” in Note 13 – Regulatory Capitaland Restrictions, beginning on page 124 of our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 8 of Part II of this report. The Dodd-Frank Reform Act madesignificant changes to how financial services companies are regulated. Many of the changes in the Dodd-Frank ReformAct are not yet complete. It could be several years before all the impacts are known. Other than those mentioned elsewhere in thisItem 1A, areas covered by the Reform Act which presently appear likely to present the greatest risks to us are mentioned below: ●Due to the scope of the new regulations adopted to date and still to be implemented, it is likely that our compliance costswill rise appreciably over the next several years, particularly in connection with consumer business, and a substantial portionof that increase likely will be permanent.●Final regulations under the Reform Act’s so-called Durbin Amendment were issued in 2011. Effective October 1 that year,they severely capped the interchange fees which banks are able to charge merchants for debit card transactions to 21 centsper transaction with an additional 5 basis points available to cover fraud losses. The cap represents a substantial reduction comparedto the rates that prevailed in the market previously. It is estimated that our annual revenue from interchange fees was reducedby approximately $15 million to $20 million. In 2013 a court ruled that the reductions imposed in the regulations were too lenient.That ruling has been stayed pending appeal but, if upheld, our interchange fee revenue would be further curtailed. Retroactiveapplication of the ruling could result in a one-time impact as well as loss of future revenue.●A new regulatory agency was created: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or “Bureau.” The Bureau has substantialauthority over our consumer finance products and services, and therefore is likely to have a substantial impact on our consumerfinancial services businesses. The Bureau’s rule-making authority is extensive, including such things as setting terms andconditions on consumer products and services and defining deceptive and abusive practices. The Bureau has issued a number of importantrules and proposed others affecting a wide range of consumer products including home mortgages. Many other areas affecting consumerfinancial services, especially related to lending, collection, and fee charges, are subject to Bureau regulations. The eventualimpact of those and future rules and actions is not fully known.●The Reform Act’s new requirements on mortgage lenders, servicers, and securitizers could adversely impact our abilityto conduct mortgage lending and servicing activities, and similarly could impact mortgage-lending banks which are customers ofours. Moreover, the Bureau’s new requirements for qualified mortgage loans, which are effective in 2014, could have the effectof reducing availability of credit and, therefore, reducing home purchases and property values, particularly in those areas inwhich homeowners disproportionately fall below the new minimum thresholds.35●The Reform Act’s municipal advisor requirements could adversely affect our capital markets, derivatives, and other activitieswith municipal customers.●Regulators have begun implementing new stress testing and other risk management regimes which are likely to continue to evolve.Stress testing processes require banks to estimate the impact on capital, liquidity, and other measures of safety of certain assumedenvironmental shocks. A failure to satisfy regulatory stress testing, or another new significant risk management standard, couldresult in the imposition of operating restrictions on us and require us to raise capital, which could adversely affect operatingresults or be dilutive to our shareholders.●The Reform Act could substantially increase our deposit insurance costs.●The Reform Act has excluded certain items, including trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital of financial institutionshaving assets of $15 billion or more. A direct effect of this exclusion will be to remove $200 million of currently outstandingsecurities from our Tier 1 capital partly after 2014 and entirely after 2015.●In 2011 the SEC adopted a final rule implementing a whistleblower bounty provision of the Reform Act. This rule could increaseour costs of dealing with certain types of employment disputes and weaken the effectiveness of our compliance and ethics “hotline”and other internal reporting processes.●Regulations under the Reform Act governing derivatives could adversely affect certain activities of our capital markets business.●There is a risk that the burden of many of the increased compliance costs could be uneven over the industry in terms of theimpact to each institution’s efficiency ratio (the ratio of costs to revenues), leaving some institutions disadvantaged relativeto others. Uneven outcomes could arise because: larger institutions may be able to bear some of the new costs more efficientlydue to economies of scale; some new burdens do not apply to smaller institutions at all or are intended to impact community banksmuch less than regional, national, or international banks; and, there is a risk of unintended impacts. Uneven impact may be inevitablebecause in most cases: each new burden will apply to a range of activities; each institution has its own mix of business activities;and, the various burdens tend to be unequal from one activity to the next. A weakening of federal pre-emption mayincrease our compliance and operational costs and risk, and may increase them substantially. Most states and some communitieshave in place various laws pertaining to lending and other business activities conducted by banks, some of which may not be pre-emptedby federal law. For many years the OCC took the position that it was the exclusive regulator of various aspects of national banks,such as ours, or their operating subsidiaries, such as our former mortgage company. This position allowed national banks to operateunder one set of rules in many important respects. In recent years that position has been impacted by two events. In its 2009 decisionknown as Cuomo v. Clearing House Association L.L.C., the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the OCC does not have the exclusive ability to enforce certain state and local laws applicableto certain business activities of national banks which are not pre-empted by federal law. Cuomo holds that the NationalBank Act allows states to enforce non-pre-empted laws through judicial proceedings against national banks. In 2010 the Dodd-FrankReform Act codified the Cuomo holding and created the Bureau, which has certain regulatory powers over national banks inconsumer matters. In 2011, acting under the Reform Act, the OCC conformed its pre-emption rule to Cuomo and the requirementsof the Reform Act regarding visitorial powers and pre-emption standards. Since that time some courts have found various state lawsnot to be pre-empted and, therefore, to be applicable to national banks in reliance on the Reform Act. Other courts have upheldpre-emption under the new rule. Dealing with potential state and local enforcement activity relating to non-pre-empted laws would,at a minimum, increase the compliance costs for national banks like ours that have operations or customers in more than one stateand could prevent us from offering uniform products across all markets we serve.36The new healthcare reform law may increaseour costs, and there is a significant risk that the increases over time will be substantial. Many of the most significant provisionsof this 2010 legislation first took effect in 2014. Reaction by employers has been varied, and further adjustments by employersare likely to continue into 2015.The overall impact of the law upon our costs and employee retention will not be known for sometime. We face the risk of increased litigationfrom customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal,state, and local entities and regulators. Since 2008 the risks of certain types of litigation have increased. For us, the mostnotable of those types are (i) lender liability claims, (ii) claims involving investors or counterparties under financial or otherstress, including in particular purchasers of mortgages originated prior to 2009, investors in mortgage-backed securities soldprior to 2008, and agencies administering mortgage-related government programs, (iii) claims based on declines in our stock price,and (iv) claims based on novel legal theories. The risk from the first two types has increased primarily because borrowers andother contractual counterparties have experienced financial stress, in many cases resulting in an attempt to obtain funds or relieffrom a solvent party (us). We expect that this heightened risk level will not abate until after economic conditions, includingresidential real estate values, substantially improve on a stable basis. The elevated risk associated with type (iii) largely isa result of volatile stock price performance and eventually should fall back to ordinary levels if volatility in our stock pricemoderates. Risks of Expense Control Our    ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival    and prosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Many    factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly    they grow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction,    additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization,    evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things.    The importance of managing expenses has been amplified in the current slow    growth, low net interest margin business environment. Overall,    our noninterest expenses have been improving: in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013    noninterest expense was $1,341.8 million, $1,293.0 million, $1,383.7 million,and $1,158.6 million, respectively. Volatility in noninterest expense has been    significantly affected by increasingly idiosyncratic charges related to legacy    mortgage activities as discussed in this Item 1A under the caption “Legacy    Mortgage Business Risks”beginning on page 26. We manage controllable expenses and riskthrough a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordinationand processes. In recent years we have exited non-strategic businesses and have actively sought to make strategic businesses moreefficient primarily by investing in technology, re-thinking and right-sizing our physical facilities, and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce. These effortsusually entail additional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases and implementation, facility closure or renovationcosts, and severance costs, while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in the future. We have also re-focused our attention onthe economic profit generated by our business activities and prospects rather than merely revenues or ordinary profit. Economicprofit analysis attempts to relate ordinary profit to the capital employed to create that profit with the goal of achieving higher(more efficient) returns on capital employed overall. Activities with higher capital usage bear a greater burden in economic profitanalysis. The process is intended to allow us to more efficiently manage investment of our resources. Economic profit analysisinvolves a significant amount of judgment regarding capital allocation. Mistakes in those judgments could result in a misallocationof resources and diminished profitability over the long run.37Geographic Risks We are subject to risks of operatingin various jurisdictions. To a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster,and other risks that primarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If the southeasternU.S., and Tennessee in particular, were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experienceadversity to a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader footprint. We have a capital markets office outsideof the United States in Hong Kong. Operating a non-U.S. office, employing non-U.S. persons, and engaging non-U.S. vendors and othercounterparties creates a number of risks: the risk that taxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraintsmay be created or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact our ability to operate overseas profitably or at all;the risk that our assets and operations could be nationalized in whole or part without adequate compensation; the risk that currencyexchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the U.S. dollarvalue of liabilities; the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in unexpected ways; the risk ofnon-compliance associated with foreign regulation or U.S. regulation of non-U.S. activities; and the risk that political or culturalpreferences in a host country might become antagonistic to U.S. companies. Our ability to manage those and other risks dependsupon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate differences in cultural and other expectations applicableto customers, employees, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; our ability to recognize and actupon opportunities and constraints peculiar to the countries and cultures in which our offices operate; our ability to recognizeand manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and our ability to anticipate the stability of or changes in the political,legal, and monetary systems of the countries in which our offices operate. Insurance Our property and casualty insurance maynot cover or may be inadequate to cover the risks that we may become subject to, and we may be adversely affected by a defaultby the insurers that provide us mortgage and bank-owned life insurance. We use insurance to manage a number of risks,including damage or destruction of property as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured, in any giveninsured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks thatare insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them.We treat the former risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and by striving to usemore than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in anycontractual situation. A portion of our retail loan portfolio involvesmortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent,that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase inour loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a correspondingimpact on our financial results. In recent years events of this sort have happened. If many default insurers were to experiencedowngrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the defaultinsurance industry could curtail our ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which could result in a loss of businessfor us. We own certain bank-owned life insurancepolicies as assets on our books. Some of those policies are “general account” and others are “separate account.”The general account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier might experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent.The separate account policies38are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry a higherrisk of value fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies. Both risks are managed through periodic reviews of thecarriers and the underlying security values. However, particularly for the general account policies, our ability to liquidate apolicy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantly limited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations aswell as by a substantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination. Liquidity and Funding Risks Liquidity is essential to our businessmodel and a lack of liquidity or an increase in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses, resultsof operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doingbusiness and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our funding requirements in 2012 and 2013 weremet principally by deposits and by financing from other financial institutions. Historically we also depended upon financing fromprivate institutional investors by means of the capital markets. In 2008 and 2009 we were not able to utilize the private marketseconomically, but late in 2010 we issued and sold $500 million of senior notes in an underwritten offering which remain outstandingat December 31, 2013, and in January 2013 we issued shares of preferred stock and sold interests in them. The recent past illustrates,however, the risk that capital markets may become unavailable for reasons beyond our control. Deposits traditionally have providedour most affordable funds, and during much of the past three years our deposits have generally trended upward despite the low-interest-rateenvironment. However, deposit trends can shift with economic conditions. If the economy improves, deposit levels in our Bank mightfall, perhaps fairly quickly, as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in other vehicles; this couldpressure us to raise our deposit rates, which could shrink our net interest margin to the extent that loan rates do not rise correspondinglyand at the same time. A number of more general factors could makesuch funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results,organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptionsin the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changesaffecting our loan portfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations,ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing ourfunding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economiesand financial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S. government and its agencies, and may become or remainincreasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond our control. Events affecting interest rates, markets,and other factors may adversely affect the demand for our products and services in our capital markets business. As a result,disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in that business unit. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings directly affect theavailability and cost of our unsecured funding. The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several ratingentities for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-basedfunding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moody’s Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poor’sand Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. In recent years, including most recently in 2013, we haveexperienced downgrades by the various agencies at various times. At December 31, 2013, two of the three rating agencies continuedto rate the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation as investment grade, and all three rated such debt of the Bank as investmentgrade, although we were at or near the lowest levels of investment grade. To the extent that in the future we depend on institutionalborrowing and the39capital markets for funding and capital, we could experiencereduced liquidity and increased cost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered belowinvestment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future and thuscan adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please notethat a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time,and should be evaluated independently of any other rating. Reductions in our credit ratings couldallow counterparties to terminate and immediately force us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provideadditional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. At this time, those of our ISDA master agreements whichhave ratings triggers reference the lower of S&P’s or Moody’s ratings. Based on those ratings, for some time wehave been required to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positions with most derivative counterparties.Should a credit rating downgrade occur, the maximum additional collateral we would have been required to post is approximately$7 million as of December 31, 2013. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks We are subject to interest rate riskas a significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directlyimpact our revenues and expenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balancesheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. A flat or inverted yield curve may reduceour net interest margin and adversely affect our lending and capital markets businesses. The yield curve simply shows the interestrates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; itis flat when short-term rates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates.Historically, the yield curve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted for shortor even protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impactour lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenuesof our capital markets business. A goal and effect of certain actions by the Federal Reserve over the past few years has been toflatten the yield curve, and our net interest margin has declined over this period. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historicallyis so uncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such a market condition is reasonably likely to create. Expectations by the market regardingthe direction of future interest rate movements can impact the demand for fixed income investments which in turn can impact therevenues of our capital markets business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet beenreflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain. Securities Inventories and Market Risks The trading securities inventories wehold in our capital markets business are subject to market and credit risks. In the course of that business we hold tradingsecurities inventory positions for purposes of distributions to customers, and we are exposed to certain market risks attributableprincipally to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with fixed-income securities. We manage the risks of holding inventoriesof securities through certain market risk management policies and procedures, including, for example, hedging activities and Value-at-Risk(“VaR”) limits, trading policies, modeling, and stress analyses. Capital markets trading securities (long positions)were $794.5 million as of December 31, 2013, $1.2 billion at year-end 2012, and $962.1 million at year-end 2011.Trading liabilities(short positions) were $368.3 million, $564.4 million, and $347.3 million at December 31, 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively.40Additional information concerning these risks and our managementof them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the caption “Market Risk Management”beginning on page 43 of the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationssection of our 2013 Annual Report, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference intoItem 7 of Part II of this report. Declines, disruptions, or precipitouschanges in markets or market prices can adversely affect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and other income relatedto our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in marketsor market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources. Significant changes to the securitiesmarket’s performance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a numberof assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performancecan have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. A major example of that linkage is our obligationto fund our pension plan so that it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligations generally dependupon actuarial estimates of benefits claims and actuarial estimates of future plan asset values. To a substantial extent the pensionplan invests its assets in marketable securities. Our obligations to fund the plan can diminish substantially if the plan’sinvestments perform well, and can grow substantially if those investments perform poorly. Changes in those obligations generallytranslate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense, which in turn affects our financial performance. Although ourobligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, including changes in our participating employeepopulation and changes to the plan itself, declines in market performance tend to increase our obligations to fund the pensionplan. We froze new plan benefits after 2012, and in 2011 we changed the plan’s asset allocation investment strategy. Althoughwe expect those changes to moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable. That riskof volatility would be amplified if certain actuarial assumptions change adversely, especially the discount rate used to estimatethe projected benefit obligation, or if the accounting rules regarding pension liability estimates change adversely. Our hedging activities may be ineffective,may not adequately hedge our risks and are subject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses we attempt to createpartial or full economic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. Our capital markets unit manages interest rate riskon a portion of its trading portfolio with short positions, futures, and options contracts. We also use derivatives, includingswaps, swaptions, caps, forward contracts, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate the impact on earnings as interestrates change. Generally, these hedged items include certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans. Hedging createscertain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk,which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk).Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Accounting Risks The preparation of our consolidatedfinancial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significantestimates that affect the financial statements. Two of our most critical estimates are: the level of the allowance for creditlosses; and the level of repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure reserves.However, other estimates occasionally become highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigationand other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjustedaccordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we41may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/orsustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision forimpairment of our goodwill or other assets, or we may make some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimatesthat we make today. Moreover, in some cases, especially concerning litigation and other contingency matters where critical informationis inadequate, we are entirely unable to make estimates. We    lack first-hand visibility regarding certain loans, other assets, or liabilities    which increases the risk that our estimates may be inaccurate. For example,    interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and linesof credit secured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential properties requires    that the performance of the first lien should be considered when assessing    the collectability and inherent loss of a performing junior lien. Additionally,    the OCC has clarified that an institution’s income recognition policy    should incorporate management’s consideration of all reasonably availableinformation including, for junior liens, the performance of the associated senior    liens as well as trends in other credit quality indicators. We own and service    a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed of home equity    lines and installment loans. As of December 31, 2013, that amount was $5.3    billion. As of December 31, 2013, approximately $2.6 billion or 50 percentof the consumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone second liens.    We own or service less than 5 percent of the first liens that are senior    to these stand-alone second liens. We are not able to actively monitor the    performance status of the first liens that are serviced by others. We obtain    first lien performance information from third parties and through loss mitigation    activities, and we place a stand-alone second lien loan on nonaccrual if    we discover that there are performance issues with the first lien loan. It    is possible that if our evaluation methods change or information sources    otherwise improve our additions to nonperforming loans may be material. A    reduction in our taxable earnings outlook could adversely affect the value    of our deferred tax asset, as could a reduction in our corporate income tax    rate. We havea net deferred tax asset accumulated during recent years. At December 31, 2013    our gross deferred tax asset after valuation allowance was approximately    $405.7 million and the net deferred tax asset was approximately $275.7 million.    The value of our deferred tax asset depends in part upon our estimation of    our ability to realize the asset during applicable future periods and, less    significantly, upon our estimate of future tax rates. A significant adverse    change in our taxable earnings outlook could result in an impairment of the    value of our deferred tax asset. Also, future enactment by Congress of tax    rate reductions could result in impairment. Changes in accounting rules can significantlyaffect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generally affectall companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstancesor business operations of companies within the same industry. Changes in regulatory rules can createsignificant accounting impacts for us. Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reports basedon regulatory accounting rules. Changes in those rules can have significant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance.In addition, such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertainties related to regulatory changes can createuncertainties in our financial reporting. Risks of Holding our Stock The    principal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock is dividends    and distributions from the Bank, and the Bank cannot currently pay dividends    to us without regulatory approval. We primarily depend upon common dividends    from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our stockholders. However,    because Bank dividends exceeded earnings over the two year period 2012-2013,    regulatory constraints may prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends    to us in 2014 without regulatory42approval.  Applying the applicable regulatory rules, as of December 31, 2013 and 2012,  the Bank had negative $141.6 million and negative $247.5 million, respectively,  available for dividends. Also, we are required to provide financialsupport to the Bank. Accordingly, at any given time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose and therefore wouldbe unavailable for dividends. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and theOCC have issued policy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out of currentoperating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among other things,that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantlyreduce its dividends if (i) the bank holding company’s net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, netof dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding company’sprospective rate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding company’s capital needs and overall current and prospectivefinancial condition; or (iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capitaladequacy ratios. As mentioned above, the capital requirements applicable to us will change, becoming more strict, starting in 2015. Our stockholders may suffer dilution ifwe raise capital through public or private equity financings to fund our operations, to increase our capital,or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, thepercentage ownership of our current common stockholders will be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferencessuperior to those of our common or outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a sales price which is dilutiveto current stockholders. We may also issue equity securities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that couldbe dilutive to stockholders. Provisions of Tennessee law, and certainprovisions of our charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have theeffect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it more difficultfor a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of our stockholders. "

The words believe, expect,anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely, will, goingforward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identifyforward-looking statements.           Forward-lookingstatements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that areinherently subject to significant business, operational, economic andcompetitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond ourcontrol, and many of which, with respect to future business decisions andactions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change.Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other importantfactors: global, general, and local economic and business conditions, includingeconomic recession or depression; the level and length of deterioration in theresidential housing and commercial real estate markets; potential requirementsfor us to repurchase previously sold or securitized mortgages or securitiesbased on such mortgages; potential claims relating to the foreclosure process;expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements,including the slope of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact ona financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations, includingfluctuations in mortgage markets; inflation or deflation; customer, investor,regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; thefinancial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition withinand outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developmentsincluding possible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness andcost-efficiency of our hedging practices; technological changes; fraud, theft,or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other means; demandfor our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in whichwe 20operate; andcritical accounting estimates. Other factors are those inherent in originating,selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets includingprepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and otherreal estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customerprofiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission(SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of theComptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority(FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Consumer FinancialProtection Bureau (Bureau), the Financial Stability Oversight Council(Council), and other regulators and agencies; regulatory, administrative, andjudicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; andour success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing therisks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhapsmaterially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.           Weassume no obligation to update or revise, whether as a result of newinformation, future events, or otherwise, any forward-looking statements thatare made in our 2012 annual report or in any other statement, release, report,or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations couldchange, possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including thosefactors listed above or presented below, in other Items of this report, or inmaterial incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report,including our 2012 annual report, should carefully consider the factorsdiscussed in this Item 1A below, among others, in evaluating forward-lookingstatements and assessing our prospects.Competition Risks          Weare subject to intense competition for customers. Ourprimary areas of competition for customers include: retail and commercial depositsand bank loans, wealth management, personal or consumer loans including homemortgages and lines of credit, capital markets products and services, and otherconsumer and business financial products and services. Our competitors in theseareas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations,credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investmentcounseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies andagencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and otherfinancial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. Somecompetitors are banks, subject to the same regulatory regime as we are, whileothers are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different orreduced degree of regulation. We expect that competition will continue to growmore intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightenedcompetition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items,upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. Foradditional information regarding competition for customers, refer to theCompetition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 17 of this report.          Wecompete to raise capital in the equity and debt markets.See Liquidity and Funding Risks beginning on page 38 of this Item 1A foradditional information concerning this risk.          Wealso compete to hire, retain and motivate our employees. Theprimary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission,incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change incontrol severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and ourcorporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively,we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will beunable to replace those persons effectively.Risk FromEconomic Downturns and Changes           Generallyin an economic downturn our credit losses increase, demand for our products andservices declines and the credit quality of our loan portfolio declines. Delinquenciesand credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to anincrease in liquidity problems for customers and 21downwardpressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level ofcreditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financial services maydecline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by othernational, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans andother financial products and services. Such factors include, for example,changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning ratesor prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change(local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financial performance inthe form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower depositlevels, and lower fees from transactions and services.           Since2007 our operating results have been adversely affected by such a weakness inthe economy, especially in real estate markets and commercial lending.Through December 31, 2012, we continued to experience overall credit qualityimprovement, but with volatility from quarter to quarter in some portfolios and(by historical norms) loss reserves, loan losses, and nonperforming assets,that continued to be elevated. In particular, the implementation of regulatoryguidance related to performing junior liens behind first liens with performanceissues and loans that have been discharged through bankruptcy has negativelyaffected asset quality trends in 2012. Net charge-offs were $131.8 million in2007, and increased to $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009,respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline and reached$324.4 million in 2011. They were $185.4 million in 2012. In 2007, theprovision for loan losses was $272.8 million and then peaked at $1.1 billionin 2008. In 2009, the annual provision began to steadily decline and was $44.0million in 2011. The provision was $78.0 million in 2012; approximately $23million of that related to the implementation of a change in regulatoryguidance. Nonperforming assets (NPAs) followed similar trends asthe loan loss provision with the level of NPAs peaking in 2008 and continuingto decline in 2012. We expect asset quality trends to berelatively stable to slightly improving in 2013; that expectation depends upona continued mild economic recovery, among other things, which may or may notoccur. However, such trends may also be impacted by future regulatory guidancesimilar to that mentioned in this Item 1A under the caption AccountingRisksbeginning on page 41. If the strength of the U.S. economy ingeneral and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operationsin particular decline, that could result in, among other things, adeterioration in credit quality with corresponding adverse effects on our loanportfolio and loan loss provision. Risks Associated with Monetary Events          TheFederal Reserve has implemented significant economic strategies that haveimpacted interest rates, inflation and the shape of the yield curve. Inrecent years the Federal Reserve has implemented a series of domestic monetaryinitiatives in response to economic conditions. Several of these haveemphasized so-called quantitative easing strategies. Other significant monetarystrategies could be implemented in the future. Such strategies can, and oftenare intended to, affect the domestic money supply, inflation and interestrates, and the shape of the yield curve. Among other things, quantitativeeasing strategies are intended to create or maintain a low interest rateenvironment and to stimulate economic activity. Risks associated with interestrates and the yield curve are discussed in this Item 1A under the captionInterest Rate and Yield Curve Risks beginning on page 39. Such strategiesalso can affect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may bedifficult to predict.          Wemay be adversely affected by the difficult economic and political situation inEurope. During 2011 and 2012 the economic andpolitical situation in Europe became uncertain due in part to monetary andfinancial stresses. Although we have little direct exposure to Euro-denominatedassets or to European debt, in the future major adverse events in Europe couldhave a substantial indirect adverse impact upon us. Key potential events whichcould have such an impact include (i) sovereign debt default (default by one ormore European governments in their borrowings), (ii) European bank and/orcorporate debt default, (iii) market and other liquidity disruptions, and, ifstresses become especially severe, (iv) the collapse of the European Union as acoherent economic group and/or the collapse of its currency, the Euro. Suchevents 22could impactus because the U.S. financial system is linked in many ways to the Europeanfinancial system, particularly through the larger U.S. institutions and theFederal Reserve. Also, European and American markets are substantially linkedso that, for example, a liquidity freeze-up in Europe could quickly impactliquidity for us in U.S. markets. The methods by which such events couldadversely affect us are highly varied but broadly include the following: anincrease in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailabilityof borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging andother counterparties, especially those which have European businessrelationships or hold Euro assets; impacts upon our customers, especially thosewhich have European business relationships or hold Euro assets; impacts uponthe U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estatevalues, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts upon us fromour regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictablyfrom possible political response to major financial disruptions.Strategic Objectives          Wemay be unable to successfully implement our strategy to grow ourretail/commercial banking and capital markets businesses. In2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapidchanges in business conditions. As part of this change in strategy, in 2008 wesold our national mortgage platforms, closed our national specialty lendingoperations, and renewed our emphasis on financial services in our traditionalTennessee-based markets. Since 2008, and continuing in 2011, we have continuedto sell or close units which have not performed or which do not complement ourstrategy. The 2008 sale of the national mortgage platforms and closure ofnational specialty lending have contributed to significant declines in theamount of loans we originate. From the end of 2008 to the end of 2012, loanswithin our non-strategic portfolio have declined 60 percent to $3.7 billion.           Althoughour current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue tochange, at present our strategys primary components are to invest capital andother resources in our retail/commercial banking business and in our capitalmarkets business. In any case growth is expected to be coordinated with a focuson stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in the past has beenprimarily organic rather than through substantial acquisitions, and in recentyears we have expanded organically into contiguous markets with characteristicssimilar to our traditional ones. In the future, we may also rely onacquisitions if appropriate opportunities, within or outside of our currentmarkets, present themselves. We believe that the successful execution ofour strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including:    our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our regional banking market areas; our ability to achieve and maintain stability in our earnings while pursuing new business opportunities which, in the current operating environment, may emphasize customers that are predisposed to change their demand for our products quickly; in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers in the US and overseas;  our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, compliance, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;  our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth;  our ability to manage any operational, cultural, liquidity, or capital risks associated with growth through purchases; and our ability to manage effectively and efficiently changes and adaptations necessitated by an increasingly complex and burdensome regulatory environment which continues to evolve rapidly.23   We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change.           To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various risks associated with that practice, including:  our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, credit, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;  our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively; our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and, our ability to retain core customers and key employees of the acquired company.             We       may be unable to successfully implement the disposition of businesses       or units which no longer fit our strategic plans. We have made several       exit moves in recent years and could make others again as we continue       to adapt to a changing business and regulatory environment. Key risks       associated with exiting a business include:  our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms; our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;  our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of an exit that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss.Risks Related to Exited Businesses          We havesignificant risks from the businesses we have exited, including mortgage loanrepurchase risk, claims of improper foreclosure practices and higher defaultrates on loans made by our former businesses. In 2008 we sold orclosed our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses.However, we retain as assets many of the loans that those businesses created.Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situatedacross the U.S. We also retain a substantial portion of the mortgage servicingrights that we previously serviced, we continue to maintain hedge positions thatwe obtain to manage certain risks related to those retained servicing rights,and we retain the risk of liability to parties with whom we made contracts inthe course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets and positionscontinue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:    We have experienced elevated losses related to claims that we did not comply with contractual or other legal requirements when we sold or securitized mortgage loans. Losses at elevated levels may continue for some time to come. In 2008, we recognized expense related to obligations to repurchase loans of $29.5 million and that expense increased to $147.8 million in 2009 and $189.8 million in 2010 before declining to $159.6 million in 2011. In second quarter 2012, we recognized $250.0 million in charges to increase the repurchase reserve as a result of significant new information received from Fannie Mae bringing the repurchase and foreclosure provision to $299.3 million for 2012. Additional information concerning this risk appears in Legacy Mortgage Business Risks beginning on page 25 of this Item 1A. We could be subject to claims that foreclosures and other servicing-related actions taken by us, or on our behalf, were done improperly. Additional information concerning this risk appears in Legacy Mortgage Business Risks beginning on page 25 of this Item 1A.24    The consumerand commercial loans on our books from our former national specialty lendingbusiness have experienced significantly higher default and loss ratescompared to pre-recession years. For example, due to declining home values,home loans secured on a second-lien basis in a significant number of caseshave little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults.Accordingly, a default on such a loan today will result in a much higher lossseverity than would have resulted shortly after the loan was originated.  Theincidence of counterparty loss on hedges, swaps, and other such instrumentsassociated with mortgage servicing rights may rise as those counterpartiesexperience financial stress or failure.Other trendsadverse to us may emerge from these legacy assets and positions ascounterparties are stressed by economic conditions, both domestic and global,and of course some of these impacts apply to continuing businesses. Over timethose losses and risks related to legacy items should diminish since thoseexited businesses will not generate new loans and new contracts, but it is notpossible to predict when that may occur. Legacy Mortgage Business Risks          Like manyother financial institutions that originated and sold significant amounts ofmortgage loans, we have experienced elevated exposure to repurchase obligationsfrom entities which purchased mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from us.Prior to August 2008, we originated loans through our legacy mortgage business,primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. Asubstantial majority of such loans were sold to or guaranteed by governmentagencies (Agencies) or were sold to other purchasers. Two primary types ofthese sales occurred: so-called whole loan sales; and sales through FirstHorizon branded proprietary securitizations. Whole loan sales were primarily totwo Agencies but also were to other purchasers; in those cases we contractedwith the buyers directly. The securities issued in the proprietarysecuritizations were backed by the loans sold and were sold to many types ofinvestors including the Agencies and federal home loan banks; in those cases wehave contractual relationships with underwriters of the securities and with thetrustees holding the loans, and we provided investors with information at thetime of sale in the form of offering documents. In some cases the whole loanssold by us were securitized by the purchaser. In some cases the loans orsecurities were insured, as mentioned below, and in those cases we contractedwith the insurers. As described below, we retain risk of loss in connectionwith each of those past relationships, and that risk varies greatly with thetype of relationship.          From2005 through 2008, we originated and sold $69.5 billion original principalamount of first lien mortgage loans in whole-loan transactions involving theAgencies. Of that, $57.6 billion was sold to two government-sponsoredenterprises (GSEs): Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home LoanMortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac). The remainder was guaranteed bythe Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae). Althoughadditional GSE whole-loan sales occurred in earlier years, a substantial majorityof GSE repurchase requests (discussed below) have come from the 2005-8 period.In addition, from 2005 through 2007 we sold $26.7 billion originalprincipal amount of first lien mortgage loans in First Horizon brandedsecuritizations. Additional proprietary securitizations occurred in earlierperiods, but the pending claims (discussed below) relate to those three years.During the period from 2000 through 2007 we also securitized HELOC andsecond-lien loans without recourse in proprietary transactions (HELOCsecuritizations).           Whole-loanpurchasers have increased their efforts to seek to require loan sellers torepurchase those loans or to reimburse purchasers for losses related to thoseloans when losses are incurred due to actual or alleged failure to strictlyconform to the purchase contract representations or warranties. A substantialmajority of our whole loan sales were to GSEs. The representations andwarranties generally are broader for whole loans sold to the GSEs and otherpurchasers than they are for the loans sold through our proprietary 25securitizations.GSE representations and warranties claims typically include claims that loanshad missing or insufficient file documentation or that loans were obtainedthrough fraud by borrowers or other third parties such as appraisers. As aresult, we face pressure from GSE and other whole-loan purchasers to repurchasethose loans or to make the purchaser whole, and we face expenses to administerand defend against such claims.           Forloans sold in proprietary securitizations we have potential exposure forinvestment rescission or damages arising from legal claims that the offeringdocuments under which the loans were securitized were materially deficient. Asof December 31, 2012, we were a defendant in a total of six such lawsuits.Additionally, we have received various indemnity demands from underwriters forcertain expenses and losses incurred in a total of three other suits but havenot been named a defendant. Other lawsuits or requests for indemnification maybe brought in the future. There is also potential repurchase exposure andrescission risk associated with our proprietary securitizations under thecontracts with trustees through which the securitizations were created. Oursecuritization trustee could initiate a repurchase process on its own or at thebehest of a sufficient percentage of securitization investors. However, therepurchase process is more difficult for securitization investors to initiatethan it is for GSEs in whole loan sales. At December 31, 2012, no suchrepurchase requests had been received with respect to our proprietaryfirst-lien mortgage securitizations. At December 31, 2012, based on applicableaccounting guidance associated with contingencies, we had no reserve forpotential losses associated with private first-lien mortgage securitizations except for one suit.          TheHELOC securitizations are credit enhanced, or wrapped, by a monolineinsurance company. Contractual representations and warranties were made to themonoline insurers, and we have received repurchase requests from a monolineinsurer based on those contractual provisions. A monoline insurer for one ofthese securitizations reportedly has become insolvent, and we are unable toestimate what, if any, loss exposure that insolvency may create for us. Becauseof interests we retained, the loans held in our HELOC securitizations generallyare recognized on our balance sheet as secured or restricted assets. Losscontent for those loans is evaluated and recognized on our financial statementsquarterly within the Allowance for Loan Losses. As a result, when we repurchasesecuritized HELOC loans the event typically has little immediate impact on ourincome statement. At December 31, 2012, based on the information available andapplicable accounting guidance, we had no reserve for potential lossesassociated with private HELOC securitizations other than the reserve within theAllowance for Loan Losses.           Asignificant portion of the loans we sold to GSEs were required to have private    mortgage insurance (MI). MI also was provided for some of the    loans in proprietary securitizations. We have received MI cancellation notices    from the insurers which wrote these policies based on claims of fraud or    misrepresentations relating to the insured loans. To date a majority of MI    cancellations have involved loans sold to GSEs. Although unresolved MI cancellation    notices are not formal repurchase requests, we include these in the active    repurchase request pipeline when analyzing and estimating loss content in    relation to the loans sold to GSEs. One MI insurer involved with loans we    sold reportedly has become insolvent. We do not expect its failure to create    new exposure for us, but it will increase the amount of our loss associated    with any related repurchases. The pipeline of repurchase requests, including    related unresolved MI cancellation notices as of December 31, 2012, 2011,    2010, and 2009 was $333.8 million, $383.5 million, $534.2 million, and $255.7    million, respectively. At the end of 2012, GSEs accounted for nearly all    of the actual repurchase/make-whole requests in the pipeline.          Ourliability for repurchase losses is assessed quarterly. Although not all loansrepurchased are in arrears or default, as a practical matter most have been. Asa result, loss recognition for repurchased loans as a group has been muchhigher than for consumer loans typically held in our portfolio. Also, althoughwe re-evaluate our reserves for repurchase losses each quarter, evaluations ofthat sort necessarily are estimates and there remains a risk that the reserveswill not be adequate. Moreover, until second quarter 2012, our ability to 26estimate ourrepurchase exposure had been limited by our lack of access to relevant dataregarding the underlying loans that we do not service. That limitation resultedin volatility in our provision expense from quarter to quarter. In the secondquarter of 2012 we recognized $250 million of expense based on substantial newinformation received from one of the two GSEs. That information allowed us, forthe first time, to estimate loss over all GSE loans sold. The information wereceived from the GSE is updated quarterly. In the future,changes in information from either GSE could cause furthervolatility in our provision expense for repurchase. The liability forrepurchase and foreclosure losses was $232.4 million, $165.3 million, and $182.9million on December 31, 2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively.          Whilethe vast majority of claims made to date relate to whole-loan sales to GSEs,claims have been made with respect to other purchasers and investors. Thenumber of repurchase requests, MI cancellation notices, or lawsuits mayincrease materially over time. An increase in the volume of such claims beyondwhat we are currently experiencing, or an increase in the loss rate weexperience upon resolution of these claims, could adversely affect ourfinancial condition and results of operations.           Additionalinformation concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and ourmanagement of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by thisreference, is set forth: under the captions Repurchase Obligations, Off-BalanceSheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligations beginning on page52, Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginningon page 59, andRepurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginning on page 67 of theManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationssection of our 2012 annual report, which is part of the material from that reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report;and under the captions First Horizon Branded Mortgage Securitization LitigationMatters  Certain Matters, First Horizon Branded Mortgage SecuritizationLitigation Matters, and LegacyHome Loan Sales and Servicing in Note 18  Contingencies and OtherDisclosures beginning on pages 132, 133, and 135, respectively, which is partof the material from our 2012 annual report that has been incorporated by referenceinto Item 8 of Part II of this report.          Although wesold our mortgage servicing business in 2008, we have significant exposuresrelated to the mortgage servicing obligations and assets which we still retainand related to the subservicing arrangements we have made since that sale.State and federal officials and regulators have announced and commencedinquiries and investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicingcompanies and banks in completing affidavits relating to foreclosures and intothe authority of the servicer to foreclose if assignments of legal interests inthe mortgage loans have not been properly recorded. The attorneys general of all 50 statesconcluded a joint investigation of foreclosure practices across the industryand proposed significant changes in servicing practices related to foreclosuresand substantial penalties. In 2012 the Justice Department announced that thefederal government and attorneys general of 49 states had reached a $25 billionsettlement agreement with five of the largest servicers to address mortgageloan servicing and foreclosure abuses. We were not a party to this settlementbut the terms of it may affect later actions involving us. PresidentObama has established a mortgage fraud task force to investigate mortgageservicing and related practices and the Bureau recently has adopted significantchanges to servicing rules which are likely to increase the cost and compliancerisks of servicing mortgage loans. Additional state or federal inquiries orinvestigations may be commenced. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome ofthese inquiries, actions, or regulatory changes or the impact that they couldhave on our financial condition, results of operations, or business.          TheOCC has issued supervisory guidance regarding consumer foreclosure practicesapplicable to national banks, including our Bank. The guidance draws uponindustry regulators experience with 14 large mortgage servicing companies.Pursuant to the guidance our Bank conducted a self-assessment of its past andpresent foreclosure practices, which was reported to the OCC. The guidance alsorequires our Bank to monitor its first-lien mortgage servicer and servicingvendors, to follow certain governance practices, and to take corrective actionregarding any deficiencies or weaknesses uncovered in the assessment.Corrective 27action includes remediation for customers whohave experienced financial harm as a result of such deficiencies. The ultimatefinancial impact to our Bank of this assessment and remediation process isunknown.          Weare aware that some local and state government agencies have begun to assertclaims against mortgage owners, trustees, and servicers related generally tomaintenance of foreclosed and other properties, including in some casesproperties which we own or with which we are otherwise involved. The number andscope of such claims may increase significantly as more foreclosures arecompleted across the U.S. in circumstances where, for market or other reasons,the property is not sold immediately to an unrelated third party.          Whenwe sold our servicing business in 2008 we retained significant servicingobligations and assets. At that time we engaged as our subservicer thepurchaser of our business. In 2011 that engagement expired and we engaged a newsubservicer. Our former subservicer has experienced significant losses in connectionwith its servicing business based in part on the circumstances outlined above    and in connection with a Consent Decree relating to same with the OCC, and    has informed us that it expects us to reimburse it for a significant portion    of those costs under our subservicing agreement. We disagree with our former    subservicers positionand have made no reimbursements. Wealso believe that certain amounts billed us by agencies for penalties andcurtailments of claims by the subservicer prior to the subservicing transferbut billed after that date are owed by the subservicer. This disagreementhas the potential to result in litigation and, in any such future litigation,the claim against us may be substantial. In December 2012 thesubservicer entered into a settlement agreement with the OCC along with 13other large mortgage servicers that replaced the Consent Decree and itsforeclosure look-back process and requires remediation for all borrowers within process foreclosures from 2009  2010.          Anumber of federal laws, including the False Claims Act, provide for substantialrecoveries and penalties if false information is provided to a federal agency,and also provide that private citizens may sue in the name of the agency andobtain a portion of any recovery as a bounty. Some of these laws provide legalavenues for a wide variety of governmental claims, while others can have anarrower focus but include non-governmental claims. In some cases the lawsprovide for bounties if the government obtains a recovery. It is possible thatclaims under the False Claims Act or another law may be brought in the futureregarding our past financial business activities, such as mortgageoriginations, sales, securitizations, or servicing, either by a federal agency,by another party to those activities, or by an unrelated private personinterested in pursuing the bounty.          Additionalinformation concerning risks related to servicing and foreclosure practices andour management of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by thisreference, is set forth: under the captions Repurchase and ForeclosureLiability beginning on page 59,Foreclosure Practices beginning on page 62, and Repurchaseand Foreclosure Liabilitybeginning on page 67of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Resultsof Operations section of our 2012 annual report, which is part of the materialfrom that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of PartII of this report; and under the caption Servicing and Foreclosure Practices inNote 18 Contingencies and Other Disclosures, beginning on page 140 of our 2012 annualreport, which is part of the material from that report that has been incorporatedby reference into Item 8 of Part II of this report.Reputation Risks           Our abilityto conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, ishighly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and ourfinancial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset forus. Our reputation is affected principally by our own practices and how thosepractices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regardingthe practices of 28ourcompetitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact ourreputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to parties with whom wehave important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Seniormanagement oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, andmanagement.          Damageto our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets orotherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract newcustomers and retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock,could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine ourability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverseimpacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also resultin greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws orregulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events thatresult in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.Credit Risks          We face therisk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable valueof collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. We alsoface risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may failto honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of creditcharge-offs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can varyover time. Since 2007 our credit charge-offs, especially related to lending,increased to historically high levels. Net charge-offs were $131.8 million in 2007,and increased to $572.8 million and $832.3 million in 2008 and 2009,respectively. Beginning in 2010, net charge-offs began to decline and reached$324.4 million in 2011, and for 2012, were $185.4 million. In the most recent years, our creditcharge-offs and reserves have declined. As of December 31, 2012, the level ofcredit reserves declined below the 2007 amount of $342.3 million. The allowancefor loan loss was $277.0 million as of December 31, 2012, $384.4 million at the end of 2011, $664.8million in 2010, $896.9 million in 2009, and $849.2 million in 2008.          Ourability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess thecreditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value ofany collateral, including real estate. We manage lending credit risk byattempting to diversify our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, and byrecording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factorsmentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We manageother counterparty credit risk in a variety of ways, some of which arediscussed in other parts of this Item 1A and all of which have as aprimary goal the avoidance of having too much risk concentrated with any singlecounterparty.          Werecord loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelinesand rules. As indicated in this Item 1A under the caption Accounting Risksbeginning on page 41,these guidelines and rules could change and cause provision expense orcharge-offs to increase, or to be recognized on an accelerated basis, forreasons related or unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio.Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positions applicable to our holdingcompany that may be inconsistent with those taken by the OCC or otherregulators for the Bank.           Asignificant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models andapproaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into accountchanges in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and othercollateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on ourexperience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years wehave changed our models and approaches based on changes in circumstances, andwe will continue to do so as conditions change. At times those changes have hadsignificant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. Inaddition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios andlending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistentwith underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could bemisguided or otherwise adversely affected with substantial adverse consequencesto us. 29          Fora significant component of our loan portfolios, second-lien consumer real estate    loans where we do not own or service the related first-lien loans, we lack    complete information on which to model loss content and to assess individual    loan collectability. In that case there is risk that our modeling and nonaccrual    policies and procedures could be inadequate simply due to a lack of visibility    into certain performance data, and also risk of a sudden change in estimated    credit loss if we obtain more complete information.    If we are able to obtain more complete information about the first-lien loans    that may be reasonably relied upon in order to predict loan performance,    it could result in a significant increase in nonperforming loans and could    result in incremental loan loss provisioning on those loans.           Thecomposition of our loan portfolio inherently increases our sensitivity tocertain credit risks. At December 31, 2012, approximately 53% of total loansconsisted of the commercial and industrial (C&I) category, whileapproximately 32% consisted of the consumer real estate category. Only oneother category exceeded 5%, and no other exceeded 10%, of total loans.           The largest component of the C&I category at year end was loans tomortgage companies, a component which grew significantly compared with 2011 andwhich represented about 21% of the C&I category at December 31, 2012. Thesecond largest component was loans to other finance and insurance companies. Asa result, nearly 40% of the C&I category was sensitive to impacts on thefinancial services industry. As discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A withrespect to our company, the financial services industry is more sensitive tointerest rate and yield curve changes, monetary policy, regulatory policy,changes in real estate and other asset values, and changes in general economicconditions than many other industries. Negative impacts on the industry coulddampen new lending in these lines of business and could create credit impactsfor the loans in our portfolio.          Theconsumer real estate category contains a number of concentrations which affectcredit risk assessment of the category.     Product concentration.The consumer category consists primarily of home equity lines of credit, and much of the remainder consists ofconsumer installment loans.  Collateralconcentration. This entire category is secured by residential real estate. Over50% of the category consists of loans secured on a second-lien basis.  Geographicconcentration. At year end about 49% of the category related to Tennesseecustomers, 11% related to California, and no other state represented morethan 3% of the category.  Legacyconcentration. The consumer category is comprised in significant part of loansoriginated before 2009 by our legacy national mortgage lending business.Those loans consist of loans we originated and did not sell and loans we haverepurchased in the course of resolving repurchase claims with loan buyers.The portfolio of legacy loans has been shrinking in recent years; however, itremains a substantial portion of our overall portfolio. The consumerreal estate category is highly sensitive to economic impacts on consumercustomers and on residential real estate values. Job loss or downward jobmigration, as well as significant life events such as divorce, death, ordisability, can significantly impact credit evaluations of the portfolio. Also,in the current environment regulatory changes, discussed above and elsewhere inthis Item 1A, are more likely to affect the consumer category and ouraccounting estimates of credit loss than other loan types.          Additionalinformation concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forthunder the captions Asset Quality beginning on page 27, CreditRisk Management beginningon page 46, andAllowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 64 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of 30FinancialCondition and Results of Operations section of our 2012 annual report, which ispart of the material from that report that has been incorporated by referenceinto Item 7 of Part II of this report.          Thecurrent prolonged low-interest rate environment has created a challenge for usand other banks to balance taking on higher risk against the need for income oryield. This challenge applies not only to credit risk in our lending activitiesbut also to default and rate risks regarding our investments which, as theymature, must be reinvested at current rates.Operational Risks          Our abilityto conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon our ability tocreate and maintain an appropriate operational and organizationalinfrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with theability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise inmany ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical,operational, information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabledcomputer or other technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches,electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct byemployees or third parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequaciesmay present themselves in a myriad of ways, and actions taken to manage onerisk may be ineffective against others. For example, information technologysystems may be insufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, orother major casualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new businessconditions or opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may alsomake them less adaptable. Also, our efforts to control expenses, which is asignificant priority for us in the current business environment, increases ouroperational challenges as we strive to maintain customer service and compliancequality at lower cost.           A seriouselectronic security breach can cause significant damage and at the same time bedifficult to detect even after it occurs. Among other things, thatdamage can occur due to outright theft of funds, fraud or identity theftperpetrated on customers, or adverse publicity associated with the breach andits potential effects. Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers,and certain vendors, all of whom legitimately have access to some portion ofour systems, as well as outsiders with no legitimate access. Because of thepotentially very serious consequences associated with these risks, ourelectronic systems and their upgrades address internal and external securityconcerns to a higher degree than might be true of many companies in otherindustries, and our systems have to comply with applicable banking and otherregulations pertaining to bank safety and customer protection. Although many ofour defenses are systemic and highly technical, others are much older and morebasic. In particular, periodically we train all our employees to recognize redflags associated with fraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we trainour customers as well through regular and episodic security-oriented communications.We expect our systems and the regulatory requirements to continue to evolve astechnology and criminal techniques also continue to evolve.          Theoperational functions we outsource to third parties may experience similarerrors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may havelimited control and, in some cases, limited ability to quickly obtain analternate vendor. To the extent we increase our reliance on thirdparty vendors to perform or assist operational functions; the challenge ofmanaging the associated risks becomes more difficult.           Forexample, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage origination and servicingplatforms. We retained significant servicing right assets, however. Ofpractical necessity, we have outsourced our servicing functions to a thirdparty. In 2011 we transferred our servicing relationship from the 2008purchaser of our platform to a new vendor. The complexity and significant costof that change illustrate the risks and costs associated with any change inthose vendors which provide detailed and substantial services to us. Forexample, in fourth quarter 2011, (the first full quarter of subservicing by thenew vendor), our subservicing costs were $9.8 million compared to $4.8 millionin second quarter 2011 (the last full quarter of subservicing 31by theplatform buyer). Such subservicing costs remained elevated in 2012. Managingthe operational, compliance, reputational, liability, and other risksassociated with this level of outsourcing in those business areas is an ongoingchallenge for us.          Failure tobuild and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, failure of thatinfrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disasterpreparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can leadto risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance withapplicable laws or regulatory standards. Additional informationconcerning operational risks and our management of them, all of which isincorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captionOperational Risk Management beginning on page 45 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2012 annualreport, which is part of the material from that report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.Service Risks          Weprovidea widerange of services to customers, and the provision of these servicesmaycreateclaimsagainst us that we provided them in a manner that harmed the customeror a third party, or was not compliant with applicable laws or rules.Our services include fiduciary, custodial, depositary, funds management, andadvisory services, among others. We manage these risks primarily throughtraining programs, compliance programs, and supervision processes. Additionalinformation concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which isincorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears under the captions OperationalRisk Management and ComplianceRisk Management beginning on pages 45and 46, respectively, of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations section of our 2012 annual report, whichis part of the material from that report that has been incorporated by referenceinto Item 7 of Part II of this report.Regulatory,Legislative, and Legal Risks           Theregulatory environment is challenging, and we are becoming subject to moreonerous regulations. We operate in a heavily regulated industry. Theregulatory environment has been changing more rapidly in recent years, and theregulatory burdens generally have been increasing, as a result of recent eventsaffecting traditional banking, mortgage banking, and financial marketsgenerally. Heightened levels of regulatory change are likely to continue for atleast the next several years.           Weare subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securities brokerage andunderwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rulesapplicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and,in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply withapplicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operationalpenalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations mayincrease our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain businessopportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report,beginning on page 5,for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federaland state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we,as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a widearray of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct ourbusiness, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federaland state legislative and regulatory authorities increasingly consider changingthese regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could further limit theamount of interest or fees we can charge, could further restrict our ability tocollect loans or realize on collateral, could affect the terms or profitabilityof the products and services we offer, or could materially affect us in otherways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also couldexpand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions,restricting our ability to share or receive customer information and increasingour costs. 32          Thefollowing paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related toregulatory and legal matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe theserisks exhaustively, and they do not describe all such risks that we facecurrently. Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish ascircumstances change.          We and ourBank both are required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels andratios. Those requirements are increasing. In 2012 our regulatorsproposed significant changes in, and increases to, a number of requiredregulatory capital levels and ratios. The proposals are complex and theapplication of many major elements remains unclear. However, the overall impactof the proposals will be to increase the capital we are required to maintaincompared to current required regulatory levels and reduce our capacity tocreate earnings from our capital.           Internationalbanking industry regulators have largely agreed upon significant changes in theregulation of capital required to be held by banks and their holding companiesto support their businesses. The new international rules, known as Basel III,generally increase the capital required to be held, narrow the types ofinstruments which will qualify as providing Tier 1 capital, and imposeliquidity requirements. The Basel III requirements are complex and will bephased in over many years.           TheBasel III rules do not apply to U.S. banks or holding companies automatically.Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer ProtectionAct of 2010 (Reform Act) requires U.S. regulators to reform the systemunder which the safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions,individually and systemically, are regulated. That reform effort includes theregulation of capital. In 2012 the U.S. banking regulators adopted changes, effectiveJanuary 1, 2013, to the market risk rules applicable to us. The revisions containedin the rule change the methodology for calculating the standardized risk-weightedassets of assets and, once phased in, would significantly change the risk weightingof certain assets. The U.S. banking regulators also issued notices of proposedrulemakings (NPRs)to implement the revised capital standards for U.S. financial institutions asrequired by the Reform Act. The NPRs include changes to the definition of capitaland an increase in capital requirements that phase in over many years largelyconsistent with Basel III. We cannot predict theextent the NPRs will be adopted as proposed.          Iffinancial losses were to become persistent, or if the new regulatoryrequirements are applied in an adverse manner, then at some point the abilityof us or the Bank to meet applicable requirements could be adversely affected.For us and the Bank, current regulations require a total capital ratio of 8.00percent and Tier 1 and Leverage ratios of 4.00 percent for capital adequacypurposes. As of December 31, 2012, our Total Capital ratio was 15.94 percent,    Tier 1 Capital ratio was 13.10percent, and Leverage ratio was 10.63 percent. For capital adequacy purposes    the Bank must calculate its capital ratios after excluding financial subsidiaries    as defined by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. Under such rules, as of    December 31, 2012, the Banks Total Capital, Tier 1 Capital and Leverage    ratios were 16.76 percent, 14.82percent, and 12.24percent, respectively.           Pressureto maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a weakeconomy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to ourshareholders, at least in the short term. Such actions that have occurred inthe past three years include the elimination in 2008 of our twenty cents pershare quarterly common cash dividend (which was reinstated at one cent pershare in January 2011 and increased to five cents at the January 23, 2013 boardmeeting), two sales of our common stock and the issuance of a common stockwarrant, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales or otherdispositions of assets or businesses) at times when market values weredepressed. Further such actions could occur.          Additional    information concerning these risks and our management of them, all of which    is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, appears: under the    caption Capital Adequacy in Item 1 of this report beginning on page 8;    under the captions Capital, Capital Management and Adequacy, and    Regulatory Matters beginning on pages 24, 45, and 62, respectively,    of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results    of Operations section of our 2012 annual report, which is part of the material    from that report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part    II of this report; and under the caption Regulatory Capital in Note 13     Regulatory Capital and Restrictions, beginning on page 122 of our    2012 annual report, which is part of the material from that report that has    been incorporated by reference into Item 8 of Part II of this report.33          The ReformAct made significant changes to how financial services companies areregulated.           Manyof the most sweeping changes in the Reform Act are not complete or specific butinstead authorize potentially expansive new regulations to be issued in thefuture. At this time it is not known how the Reform Act and the regulationsthat eventually will be adopted under it will affect the financial servicesindustry in general or our company in particular, and it could be several yearsbefore all the impacts are known. Although it is not possible to summarize inany detail the effects of this legislation, one likely overall impact upon uswill be to increase our regulatory compliance and certain other costssignificantly. In addition, it is possible that our operations and associatedrevenues will be constrained in some respects, perhaps significantly in someareas. Other than those mentioned elsewhere in this Item 1A, areas covered bythe Reform Act which presently appear likely to present the greatest risks tous are mentioned below:    Due to thescope of the new regulations authorized, it is likely that our compliancecosts will rise appreciably over the next several years, particularly inconnection with consumer business, and a substantial portion of that increaselikely will be permanent.   Final regulations under the Reform Actsso-called Durbin Amendment were issued in 2011. Effective October 1 thatyear, they severely capped the interchange fees which banks are able tocharge merchants for debit card transactions to 21 cents pertransaction with an additional 5 basis points available to cover fraudlosses. The cap represents a substantial reduction compared to the rates thatprevailed in the market previously. It is estimated that ourannual revenue from interchange fees has been reduced by approximately $15million to $20 million. Unless the Amendment is changed or rescinded, thatreduction is expected to be permanent.  A newregulatory agency was created: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, orBureau. The Bureau has substantial authority over our consumer financeproducts and services, and therefore is likely to have a substantial impacton our retail financial services businesses. Although presently unknown, theBureaus rules could conflict with, and possibly override, our Banks primaryregulator in consumer matters. Since the Bureaus mission is not focused uponthe safety and soundness of our Bank, conflicts of that sort could besignificantly adverse to us. The Bureaus rule-making authority is extensive,including such things as setting terms and conditions on consumer productsand services and defining deceptive and abusive practices. The Bureau hasproposed or issued a number of important rules recently affecting a widerange of consumer products such as home mortgages, and took a number of finalenforcement actions relating to such things as add-on products and vendoroversight. The eventual impact of those and future rules and actions is notknown. The Bureaus rules and enforcement actions could substantially reducerevenues, increase costs and risks, and otherwise make our consumer productsand services less profitable or unprofitable.   The ReformActs new requirements on mortgage lenders, servicers, and securitizers couldadversely impact our ability to conduct mortgage lending and servicingactivities, and similarly could impact mortgage-lending banks which arecustomers of ours. Moreover, the Bureaus new requirements for qualifiedmortgage loans could have the effect of reducing availability of credit and,therefore, reducing home purchases and property values, particularly in thoseareas in which homeowners disproportionately fall below the new minimumthresholds.  The ReformActs municipal advisor registration regime could adversely affect our capitalmarkets and other activities with municipal customers.  The Federal Reserve, among other agencies,has proposed to implement the Reform Acts so-called Volckerprovisions. The 2011 proposal would prohibit financial services companiesfrom engaging in proprietary trading activities and from investing in andsponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. Key definitions under theproposal are broad so that the proposal would regulate a wide range ofactivities. The proposal is far reaching and likely to impact the businessoperations of many if not most U.S. financial companies. Although at thistime no final rule has 34     been adoptedand the impacts upon us remain highly uncertain, it is possible that therule, when final, will require us to divest assets or curtail or closebusiness operations. Such actions could have material adverse financialconsequences as a result of immediate impacts such as losses realized on saleor closure, and ongoing impacts such as diminished sources of revenues andearnings.  Regulatorshave begun implementing new stress testing and other risk management regimeswhich are likely to continue to evolve. Stress testing processes requirebanks to estimate the impact on capital, liquidity, and other measures of safetyof certain assumed environmental shocks. A failure to satisfy regulatorystress testing, or another new significant risk management standard, couldresult in the imposition of operating restrictions on us and require us toraise capital, which could adversely affect operating results or be dilutiveto our shareholders.  The ReformAct is likely to substantially increase our deposit insurance costs. Theassessment rate is expected to increase, at least temporarily, and the baseupon which the assessment is made has been expanded from insured deposits toinclude all consolidated assets less tangible capital.  Regulators,including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the Bureau, and the FDIC, have beengiven expansive authority to regulate compensation, including loan originatorcompensation, and many other matters throughout our company in connectionwith enhanced risk regulation functions. If new regulations in this area aresevere, they could adversely impact our ability to attract or retain keyemployees and could make some business activities impractical for banks andbank holding companies.  The ReformAct has excluded certain items, including trust preferred securities, fromTier 1 capital of financial institutions having assets of $15 billion or more.A direct effect of this exclusion will be to remove $200 million of currentlyoutstanding securities from our Tier 1 capital after a phase-out period whichbegins in 2013.   In 2011 the SEC adopted final rulesimplementing a whistleblower bounty provision of the Reform Act. Although itsfull impact is uncertain, eventually this rule is likely to increase ourcosts of dealing with certain types of employment disputes and it couldweaken the effectiveness of our compliance and ethics hotline and otherinternal reporting processes.  Regulations under the Reform Act governingderivatives could adversely affect certain activities of our capital marketsbusiness.  There is arisk that the burden of many of the increased compliance costs could be unevenover the industry in terms of the impact to each institutions efficiencyratio (the ratio of costs to revenues), leaving some institutionsdisadvantaged relative to others. Uneven outcomes could arise because: largerinstitutions may be able to bear some of the new costs more efficiently dueto economies of scale; some new burdens do not apply to smaller institutionsat all or are intended to impact community banks much less than regional,national, or international banks; and, there is a risk of unintended impacts.Uneven impact may be inevitable because in most cases: each new burden willapply to a range of activities; each institution has its own mix of businessactivities; and, the various burdens tend to be unequal from one activity tothe next.          A weakeningof federal pre-emption may increase our compliance and operational costs andrisk, and may increase them substantially. Most states and somecommunities have in place various laws pertaining to lending and other businessactivities conducted by banks, some of which may not be pre-empted by federallaw. For many years the OCC took the position that it was the exclusiveregulator of various aspects of national banks, such as ours, or theiroperating subsidiaries, such as our former mortgage company. This positionallowed national banks to operate under one set of rules in many importantrespects. In recent years that position has been impacted by two events. In its2009 decision known as Cuomo v. ClearingHouse Association L.L.C.,the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the OCC does not have theexclusive ability to enforce certain state and local laws applicable to certainbusiness activities of national35banks whichare not pre-empted by federal law. Cuomoholds that the National Bank Act allows states to enforce non-pre-empted lawsthrough judicial proceedings against national banks. In 2010 the Reform Actcodified the Cuomo holding and created the Bureau, which has certainregulatory powers over national banks in consumer matters. In 2011, actingunder the Reform Act, the OCC conformed its pre-emption rule to Cuomoand the requirements of the Reform Act regarding visitorial powers andpre-emption standards. Since that time some courts have found various statelaws not to be pre-empted therefore to be applicable to national banks inreliance on the Reform Act. Other courts have upheld pre-emption under the newrule. Dealing with potential state and local enforcement activity relating tonon-pre-empted laws would, at a minimum, increase the compliance costs fornational banks like ours that have operations or customers in more than onestate and could prevent us from offering uniform products across all marketswe serve.          The newhealthcare reform law may increase our costs, and there is a significant riskthat the increases over time will be substantial. Many of the mostsignificant provisions of this 2010 legislation depend upon substantial, and asyet unknown or unfinalized, regulations and other rules, and the application ofmany provisions are to be phased in over several years, with substantialprovisions first taking effect in 2013 and, more significantly, in 2014. Theoverall impact of the law upon us will not be known for some time.          We face therisk of increased litigation from customers, employees, vendors, contractualparties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and fromfederal, state, and local entities and regulators. Since 2008 therisks of certain types of litigation have increased. For us, the most notableof those types are (i) lender liability claims, (ii) claims involving investorsor counterparties in financial distress, including investors in mortgage-backedsecurities sold prior to 2008, (iii) claims based on declines in our stockprice, and (iv) claims based on novel legal theories. The risk from the firsttwo types has increased primarily because borrowers and other contractualcounterparties have experienced financial stress, in many cases resulting in anattempt to obtain funds or relief from a solvent party (us). We expect thatthis heightened risk level will not abate until after economic conditions,including residential real estate values, substantially improve. The elevatedrisk associated with type (iii) largely is a result of volatile stock priceperformance and eventually should fall back to ordinary levels if volatility inour stock price moderates.          Arecent example illustrates type (iv). A number of local governments haveenacted ordinances requiring lenders, prior to foreclosure, to register,inspect, and/or maintain real properties securing loans that are in default orpending foreclosure. Compliance with these ordinances exposes lenders tolitigation risk for violation of the owners property rights and significantadditional costs. Moreover ordinances of this type adversely alter the businessclimate and can raise the costs and risks of lending for all lenders.Risks of ExpenseControl           Our abilityto successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival andprosperity but in part is subject to risks beyond our control. Manyfactors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly theygrow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additionalexpenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolvingbusiness strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. Theimportance of managing expenses has been amplified in the current slow growth,low net interest margin business environment. Overall, our noninterest expenseshave been improving as expense in 2009, 2010, and 2011 were $1,536.8 million,$1,341.8 million, and $1,293.0 million, respectively. For 2012, expenses were$1,383.7 million; 2012 expenses have been affected by charges related to legacymortgage activities as discussed in this Item 1A under the caption LegacyMortgage Business Risks beginning on page 25.          Wemanage expense growth and risk through a variety of means, includingselectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurementcoordination and processes, and through an expense 36managementcommittee. In recent years we have exited non-strategic businesses and haveactively sought to make strategic businesses more efficient primarily byinvesting in technology, re-thinking and right-sizing our physical facilities,and re-thinking and right-sizing our workforce. These efforts usually entailadditional near-term expenses in the form of technology purchases andimplementation, facility closure or renovation costs, and severance costs,while expected benefits typically are realized with some uncertainty in thefuture.Geographic Risks          We aresubject to risks of operating in various jurisdictions. To asignificant degree our banking business is exposed to economic, regulatory,natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact Tennessee andneighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. If theTennessee region were to experience adversity not shared by other parts of thecountry, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared by thosecompetitors which have a broader footprint.          Wehave a capital markets office outside of the United States in HongKong. Operating a non-U.S. office creates a number of risks: the risk thattaxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may becreated or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact ourability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets andoperations could be nationalized in whole or part without adequatecompensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could move unfavorably soas to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or to enlarge theU.S. dollar value of liabilities, the risk that legal recourse against foreigncounterparties may be limited in unexpected ways, risks and costs associatedwith U.S. banking and other regulation of non-U.S. business activities; and therisk that political or cultural preferences in a host country might becomeantagonistic to U.S. companies. Our ability to manage those and other risksdepends upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize andanticipate differences in cultural and other expectations applicable tocustomers, employees, regulators, vendors, and other business partners andcounterparties; our ability to recognize and act upon opportunities andconstraints peculiar to the countries and cultures in which our officesoperate; our ability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to whichwe are exposed; and our ability to anticipate the stability of or changes inthe political, legal, and monetary systems of the countries in which ouroffices operate. Insurance          Our propertyand casualty insurance may not cover or may be inadequate to cover the risksthat we may become subject to, and we may be adversely affected by a default bythe insurers that provide us mortgage and bank-owned life insurance.           Weuse insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction ofproperty as well as legal and other liability. Not all such risks are insured,in any given insured situation our insurance may be inadequate to cover allloss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For those risks that are insured,we also face the risks that the insurer may default on its obligations or thatthe insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat the former risk as a type ofcredit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers that we use and bystriving to use more than one insurer when practical. The risk of refusal,whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherent in any contractualsituation.          Aportion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If adefault insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were tobecome insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loansinsured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in ourloan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on ourbalance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financialresults. In recent years events of this sort have happened. If many defaultinsurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the riskof a financial impact 37would beamplified and the disruption to the default insurance industry could curtailour ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which could resultin a loss of business for us.          Weown certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assets on our books. Some ofthose policies are general account and others are separate account. Thegeneral account policies are subject to the risk that the carrier mightexperience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separate accountpolicies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry the risk of valuefluctuations in securities which underlie those policies. Both risks aremanaged through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying securityvalues. However, particularly for the general account policies, our ability toliquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantlylimited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by asubstantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination.Liquidity and Funding Risks          Liquidity      is essential to our business model and a lack of liquidity or an increase      in the cost of liquidity may materially and adversely affect our businesses,      results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In general,      the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business and,therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Our fundingrequirements in 2011 and 2012 were met principally by deposits and by financingfrom other financial institutions. Historically we also depended upon financingfrom private institutional investors by means of the capital markets. In 2008and 2009 we were not able to utilize the private markets economically, but latein 2010 we issued and sold $500 million of senior notes in an underwrittenoffering which remain outstanding at December 31, 2012. The recent pastillustrates, however, the risk that capital markets may become unavailable forreasons beyond our control. Deposits traditionally have provided our mostaffordable funds, and in 2010, 2011, and 2012 our deposits have generallytrended upward despite the low-interest-rate environment. However, deposittrends can shift with economic conditions; if the economy improves, depositlevels in our Bank might fall as depositors become more comfortable with riskand seek higher returns in other vehicles. In addition, the governmentsTAG insurance program, which was implemented in 2008 during the financialcrisis, expired on December 31, 2012. The TAG program granted unlimited FDICinsurance to certain commercial deposit accounts. The expiration of the programmay cause volatility in deposit levels.           Anumber of more general factors could make such funding more difficult, moreexpensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to,our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts onour reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptionsin the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financialservices industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loanportfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatorystructure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economicconditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environmentsgoverning our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds isstrongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies andfinancial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S.government and its agencies, and may become or remain increasingly difficultdue to economic and other factors beyond our control.           Eventsaffecting interest rates, markets, and other factors may adversely affect thedemand for our products and services in our capital markets business.As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings inthat business unit. For instance, market disruptions in 2007 significantlyreduced the demand for certain of our capital markets products and services.Credit Ratings          Our creditratings directly affect the availability and cost of our unsecured funding.The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several ratingentities for unsecured borrowings. A 38rating belowinvestment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost ofmarket-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moodys InvestorsService, or BBB- or higher by Standard & Poors and Fitch Ratings, isconsidered investment grade for many purposes. In recent years, including mostrecently in 2012, we have experienced downgrades by the various agencies atvarious times. At December 31, 2012, all three rating agencies continued torate the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investmentgrade, although we were at or near the lowest levels of that grade. To the extentthat in the future we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital marketsfor funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increasedcost of unsecured funding if our debt ratings were lowered further,particularly if lowered below investment grade. In addition, other actions byratings agencies can create uncertainty about our ratings in the future andthus can adversely affect the cost and availability of funding, includingplacing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Please note that a creditrating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject torevision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently ofany other rating.          Reductionsin our credit ratings could allow counterparties to terminate and immediatelyforce us to settle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us toprovide additional collateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements.At this time, all of our ISDA master agreements reference the lower of S&Por Moodys ratings. Based on those ratings, for some time we have beenrequired to post collateral in the amount of our derivative liability positionswith most derivative counterparties. Should a one or two notch S&P orMoodys downgrade occur, the maximum additional collateral we would have beenrequired to post is approximately $8 million as of December 31, 2012.Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks          We aresubject to interest rate risk as a significant portion of our business involvesborrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest ratesdirectly impact our revenues and expenses, and potentially could expand orcompress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet tocontrol the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about byordinary fluctuations in rates.           The value ofour mortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio is affected by changes ininterest rates. Although we sold our mortgage servicing platform in2008, we still retain substantial MSR assets. The value of MSR assets declineswhen the underlying loans are refinanced, otherwise paid early, or charged off.Generally, when interest rates increase, the value of MSR generally increases,and when rates decline the value of MSR tends to decline. However, thosegeneral tendencies do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; forexample, a decrease in interest rates does not always result in a predictableincrease in refinancings because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtailcredit availability.           A flat orinverted yield curve may reduce our net interest margin and adversely affectour lending business. The yield curve simply shows the interestrates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep whenshort-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it is flat whenshort-term rates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it is inverted whenshort-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normallyis positively sloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat orinverted for short or even protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curvetends to decrease net interest margin, which would adversely impact our lendingbusinesses, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, whichwould adversely impact the revenues of our capital markets business. A goal andeffect of certain actions by the Federal Reserve over the past few years hasbeen to flatten the yield curve, and our net interest margin has declined overthis period. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historically is souncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such a marketcondition is reasonably likely to create.          Expectationsby the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements,particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which inturn can impact the 39revenues of ourcapital markets business. That risk is most apparentduring times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in marketrates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.Securities Inventories and Market Risks          Theinventories we hold in our capital markets business are subject to market andcredit risks. In the course of that business we hold inventorypositions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition,we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debtsecurities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities throughcertain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related tocertain interest rate risks. Capital markets trading securities (longpositions) were $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2012, and $962.1 million as ofthe end of 2011.Trading liabilities (short positions) were $564.4 million and$347.3 million at December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively.          Declines,disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or market prices can adverselyaffect our fees and other income sources. We earn fees and otherincome related to our brokerage business and our management of assets forcustomers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in markets or marketprices can adversely affect those revenue sources.          Significantchanges to the securities markets performance can have a material impact uponour assets, liabilities, and financial results. We have a number ofassets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly, to majorsecurities markets. Significant changes in market performance can have amaterial impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results.          Amajor example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan sothat it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension fundingobligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims andactuarial estimates of future plan asset values. To a substantial extent thepension plan invests its assets in marketable securities. Our obligations tofund the plan can diminish substantially if the plans investments performwell, and can grow substantially if those investments perform poorly. Changesin those obligations generally translate into positive or negative changes inour pension expense, which in turn affects our financial performance. Althoughour obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many otherthings, including changes in our participating employee population and changesto the plan itself, declines in market performance in recent years have tendedto increase our obligations to fund the pension plan, and that tendency islikely to continue to be felt over the next several years. We froze new planbenefits after 2012, and in 2011 we changed the plans asset allocationinvestment strategy. Although we expect these changes to moderate futurevolatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility is unavoidable. Thatrisk of volatility would be amplified if certain actuarial assumptions changeadversely, especially the discount rate used to estimate the projected benefitobligation, or if the accounting rules regarding pension liability estimateschange adversely.          Our hedgingactivities may be ineffective, may not adequately hedge our risks and aresubject to credit risk. In the normal course of our businesses,including (among others) banking, capital markets, and legacy mortgageservicing, we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various,though not all, financial risks. In our legacy mortgage serving business, wehedge servicing assets (MSR and other retained interests) in order to minimizethe effects of loss in value of servicing assets associated with increasedprepayment activity that generally results from declining interest rates.Capital markets economically hedges interest rate risk on a portion of itstrading portfolio with futures and options contracts. We also use derivatives,including swaps, caps, options, and collars, that are designed to moderate theimpact on earnings as interest rates change. Generally, these hedged itemsinclude certain term borrowings and certain held-to-maturity loans. Hedgingcreates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to thehedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type ofcredit risk), and the risk that 40the hedge willnot fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpectedcounterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effecton our liquidity and earnings.Accounting Risks          Thepreparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires management to makesignificant estimates that affect the financial statements. Three ofour most critical estimates are: the level of the allowance for credit losses;the level of repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure reserves; and thevaluation of mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionallybecome highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigationand other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points intime; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to theinherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in thefuture, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/orsustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the providedallowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of ourgoodwill or other assets, or we may recognize a significant decline in the fairvalue of our mortgage servicing rights, or we may make some other adjustmentthat will differ materially from the estimates that we make today.           We      lack visibility regarding certain loans, other assets, or liabilities which      increases the risk that our estimates may be innaccurate and the risk that      our estimates could change suddenly if visibility improves. For example,      interagency supervisory guidance related to practices for loans and lines of creditsecured by junior liens on 1-4 family residential propertiesrequires that the performance of the first lien should be consideredwhen assessing the collectability and inherent loss of a performing juniorlien. Additionally, the OCC has clarified that an institutions incomerecognition policy should incorporate managements consideration of allreasonably available information including, for junior liens, the performanceof the associated senior liens as well as trends in other credit qualityindicators. As a result, FHN modified its nonaccrual policies to place currentsecond liens on nonaccrual if the first lien isowned or serviced by FHN and that first lien is90 or more days past due. Additionally,FHN enhanced its ALLL methodology to qualitatively estimate probable incurred lossesfor all current second liens in the home equity portfolio that are behind firstliens with performance issues.          Weown and service a consumer real estate portfolio that is primarily composed ofhome equity lines and installment loans. As of December 31, 2012, that amountwas $5.3 billion. As of December 31, 2012, approximately $3 billion or 54 percentof the consumer real estate portfolio consisted of stand-alone second liens.We own or service less than 5 percentof the first liens that are senior to these stand-alone second liens. Currently,    we do not have a reliable methodology to actively monitor the performance    status of the first liens that are serviced by others. We may obtain first    lien performance information through loss mitigation activities,    and beginning in first quarter 2013 we will place a stand-alone second lien    loan on nonaccrual if we discover through this process that there are performance    issues with the first lien loan. During    2012 and continuing into early 2013, we have been and are continuing to evaluate    whether data on first liens provided by third parties, including vendors,    may be reasonably relied upon in order to predict performance of the associated    second liens. It is possible that if our evaluation methods are changed our    additions to nonperforming loans may be material.           A reductionin our taxable earnings outlook could adversely affect the value of ourdeferred tax asset, as could a reduction in our corporate income tax rate.We have a net deferred tax asset accumulated during recent years. At December31, 2012 our net deferred tax asset was approximately $261 million. That valuedepends in part upon our estimation of our ability to realize the asset duringapplicable future periods and, less significantly, upon our estimate of futuretax rates. A significant adverse change in our taxable earnings outlook couldresult in an impairment of the value of our deferred tax asset. During 2012both major U.S. political parties favored a reduction in U.S. corporate incometax rates. Enactment of rate reductions in the future could result in animpairment. 41          Changes inaccounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets,liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changesgenerally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changessometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances orbusiness operations of companies within the same industry. For example, in late2012 the Financial Accounting Standards Board re-proposed for comment anaccounting standard update which would substantially change how we recognizeloss associated with loans. The new standard, which is not in final form andmay not become effective for several years, is intended to acceleraterecognition of loan loss. Final adoption of this standard could adverselyaffect our provision for loan loss expense, at least initially, and could makecertain loan products less attractive.           Changesin regulatory rules can create significant accounting impacts for us.Because we operate in a regulated industry we prepare regulatory financial reportsbased on regulatory accounting rules. Changes in those rules can havesignificant impacts upon us in terms of regulatory compliance. In addition,such changes can impact our ordinary financial reporting, and uncertaintiesrelated to such changes can create uncertainties in our financial reporting.Risks of Holding ourStock           Theprincipal source of cash flow to pay dividends on our stock is dividendsand distributions from the Bank, and the Bank cannot currently pay dividends      to us without regulatory approval. We primarily depend upon common      dividends from the Bank for cash to fund dividends we pay to our stockholders.      However, because of losses and Bank dividends over the two year period      2011-2012, regulatory constraints prevent the Bank from declaring and paying      dividends to us in 2013 without regulatory approval. Applying the applicable      regulatory rules, as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, the Bank had negative      $247.5 million and negative $403.9 million, respectively, available for      dividends.           Also,we are required to provide financial support to the Bank. Accordingly, at anygiven time a portion of our funds may have to be used for that purpose andtherefore would be unavailable for dividends.          Furthermore,the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy statements generallyrequiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out ofcurrent operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisoryletter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a generalmatter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and shouldeliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bankholding companys net income available to shareholders for the past fourquarters, net of dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficientto fully fund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding companys prospectiverate of earnings is not consistent with the bank holding companys capitalneeds and overall current and prospective financial condition; or(iii) the bank holding company will not meet, or is in danger of notmeeting, its minimum regulatory capital adequacy ratios. As mentioned above, atpresent the capital requirements applicable to us are expected to change and itis not clear what those changes will entail.          Our      stockholders may suffer      dilution if we raise capital through public orprivate equity financings to fund our operations, to increaseour capital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equitysecurities or instruments that are convertible into equity securities, thepercentage ownership of our current common stockholders will be reduced, the newequity securities may have rights and preferences superior to those of our commonor outstanding preferred stock, and additional issuances could be at a salesprice which is dilutive to current stockholders. We may also issue equity securitiesdirectly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutiveto stockholders.          Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions ofour charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third42party from attempting to acquire control ofus. These provisions could make it more difficult fora third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at a priceattractive to many of our stockholders"

Examples of uncertainties andcontingencies include, among other important factors: global, general, and local economic and business conditions, includingeconomic recession or depression; the level and length of deterioration in the residential housing and commercial real estatemarkets; potential requirements for First Horizon to repurchase previously sold or securitized mortgages or securities basedon such mortgages; potential claims relating to the foreclosure process; expectations of and actual timing and amount ofinterest rate movements, including the slope of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial servicesinstitution; market and monetary fluctuations, including fluctuations in mortgage markets; inflation or deflation; customer,investor, regulatory, and legislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers andother counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments includingpossible terrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our hedging practices; technologicalchanges; fraud, theft, or other incursions through conventional, electronic, or other means; demand for our product offerings; newproducts and services in the industries in which we operate; and critical accounting estimates. Other factors are thoseinherent in originating, selling, servicing, and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricingconcessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes incustomer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities19and ExchangeCommission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Officeof the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the FederalReserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority(FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Consumer FinancialProtection Bureau (Bureau), the Financial Stability Oversight Council(Council), and other regulators; regulatory, administrative, and judicialproceedings and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and oursuccess in executing our business plans and strategies and managing the risksinvolved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhapsmaterially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.           Weassume no obligation to update or revise, whether as a result of newinformation, future events, or otherwise, any forward-looking statements thatare made in this report or in any other statement, release, report, or filingfrom time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change,possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those factorslisted above or presented below, in other sections of this report, or inmaterial incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this reportshould carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, amongothers, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks           Wecompete with other financial services companies for customers. Our primaryareas of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans,wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages andlines of credit, capital markets products and services, and other consumer andbusiness financial products and services. Our competitors in these areasinclude national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations,credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investmentcounseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies andagencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and otherfinancial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. Somecompetitors are banks, subject to the same regulatory regime as we are, whileothers are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different orreduced degree of regulation. We expect that competition will continue to growmore intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightenedcompetition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items,upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. Foradditional information regarding competition for customers, refer to theCompetition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 16 of this report.           Wecompete for financial capital. See Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risksbeginning on page 34 of this report for additional information concerning thoserisks.           Wealso compete to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Theprimary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission,incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change incontrol severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and ourcorporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively,we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will beunable to replace those persons effectively. Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes           Delinquenciesand credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to anincrease in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure oncollateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level ofcreditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financial services maydecline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by othernational, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans andother financial products and services. Such factors include, for example,changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning ratesor prices. Accordingly, an 20economicdownturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, national, orglobal) can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses,lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, and lower fees fromtransactions and services.           Since2007, our operating results have been adversely affected by such a weakness inthe economy, especially in real estate markets and commercial lending. In 2011we continued to experience overall credit quality improvement, but withvolatility from quarter to quarter in some portfolios and (by historical norms)loss reserves that continued to be elevated. Although we expect those overalland specific trends to continue into 2012, that expectation depends upon acontinued mild economic recovery, among other things, which may not occur. Ifthe strength of the U.S. economy in general and the strength of the localeconomies in which we conduct operations in particular decline, that could resultin, among other things, a deterioration in credit quality with correspondingadverse effects on our loan portfolio and loan loss provision. Risks Associated with Domestic and ForeignMonetary Events           Inrecent years the U.S. Federal Reserve has implemented a series of domesticmonetary initiatives in response to economic conditions. Several of these haveemphasized so-called quantitative easing strategies and were known by namessuch as QE1, QE2, and Operation Twist. More recently the Federal Reserveprovided dollars to the European central bank through currency swaparrangements. Other significant monetary strategies, including a QE3, could beimplemented in the future. Such strategies can, and often are intended to,domestically affect the money supply, inflation and interest rates, and theshape of the yield curve. Risks associated with interest rates and the yieldcurve are discussed in this Item under the caption Interest Rate and YieldCurve Risks beginning on page 36 of this report. Such strategies also canaffect the U.S. and world-wide financial systems in ways that may be difficultto predict.           During2011 and continuing into 2012 the economic and political situation in Europehas become uncertain due in part to monetary and financial stresses. Althoughwe have little direct exposure to Euro-denominated assets or to European debt,in the future major adverse events in Europe could have a substantial indirectadverse impact upon us. Key potential events which could have such an impactinclude (i) sovereign debt default (default by one or more European governmentsin their borrowings), (ii) European bank and/or corporate debt default, (iii)market and other liquidity disruptions, and, if stresses become especiallysevere, (iv) the collapse of the European Union as a coherent economic groupand/or the collapse of its currency, the Euro. Such events could impact usbecause the U.S. financial system is linked in many ways to the Europeanfinancial system, particularly through the larger U.S. institutions and theFederal Reserve. Also, European and American markets are substantially linkedso that, for example, a liquidity freeze-up in Europe could quickly impactliquidity for us in U.S. markets. The methods by which such events couldadversely affect us are highly varied, but broadly include the following: anincrease in our cost of borrowed funds or, in a worst case, the unavailabilityof borrowed funds through conventional markets; impacts upon our hedging andother counterparties, especially those which have European businessrelationships or hold Euro assets; impacts upon our customers, especially thosewhich have European business relationships or hold Euro assets; impacts uponthe U.S. economy, especially in the areas of employment rates, real estatevalues, interest rates, and inflation/deflation rates; and impacts upon us fromour regulatory environment, which can change substantially and unpredictablyfrom possible political response to major financial disruptions.Growth and Disposition Risks           Everyorganization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth from 2003 to 2007resulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in bankingbased on our mortgage operations; acquisition of customers from competitorsthat have merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions.In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapidchanges in 21businessconditions. As a result, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage platforms,closed our national specialty lending operations, and renewed our emphasis onfinancial services in our traditional Tennessee-based markets. Since 2008, andcontinuing in 2011, we have continued to sell or close units which have notperformed or which do not complement our strategy.          Althoughour current strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue tochange, at present our strategys primary components are to invest capitaland other resources in our retail/commercial banking business and in our capitalmarkets business. In any case growth is expected to be coordinated with a focuson stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in the past has beenprimarily organic rather than through substantial acquisitions, and in recentyears we have  expanded organically into contiguous markets with characteristics similar toour traditional ones. In the future, we may also rely on acquisitions ifappropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, presentthemselves. We believe that the successful execution of our strategydepends upon a number of key elements, including:    our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our regional banking market areas; in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers in the US and overseas;  our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;  our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth; and our ability to manage any operational, cultural, liquidity, or capital risks associated with growth through purchases.We have inplace strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to usat present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, oradopt new strategies, as conditions change.          Tothe extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face variousrisks associated with that practice, including:    our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;  our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively; our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and, our ability to retain core customers and key employees of the acquired company.          Attimes a company must consider exiting businesses or units that no longer fitinto managements plans for the future. We have made several exit moves inrecent years and could make others again as we continue to adapt to a changingbusiness and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting abusiness include:    our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms; our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;  our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of an exit that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss.22Risks Related to Exited Businesses          In2008 we sold or closed our national mortgage and national specialty lendingbusinesses. However, we retain as assets many of the loans that those businessescreated. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estatesituated across the U.S. We also retain a substantial portion of the mortgageservicing rights that we previously serviced, we continue to maintain hedgepositions that we obtain to manage certain risks related to those retainedservicing rights, and we retain the risk of liability to parties with whom wemade contracts in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assetsand positions continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:    We have experienced elevated losses related to claims that we did not comply with contractual or other legal requirements when we sold or securitized mortgage loans. Losses at elevated levels may continue for some time to come. Additional information concerning this risk appears in Legacy Mortgage Business Risks beginning on page 23 of this report. We could be subject to claims that foreclosures and other servicing-related actions taken by us, or on our behalf, were done improperly. Additional information concerning this risk appears in Legacy Mortgage Business Risks beginning on page 23 of this report. The retail and commercial loans on our books from our former national specialty lending business have experienced significantly higher default and loss rates compared to pre-recession years. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured on a second-lien basis in a significant number of cases have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults. Accordingly, a default on such a loan today will result in a much higher loss severity than would have resulted shortly after the loan was originated.  The incidence of counterparty loss on hedges, swaps, and other such instruments associated with mortgage servicing rights may rise as those counterparties experience financial stress or failure.Other trendsadverse to us may emerge from these legacy assets and positions ascounterparties are stressed by economic conditions, both domestic and global,and of course some of these impacts apply to continuing businesses. Over timethose losses and risks related to legacy items should diminish since those exitedbusinesses will not generate new loans and new contracts, but it is notpossible to predict when that may occur. Legacy Mortgage Business Risks          Repurchaseand Similar Exposures          Like manyother financial institutions that originated and sold significant amounts ofmortgage loans, we have experienced elevated exposure to repurchase obligationsfrom entities which purchased mortgages and mortgage-backed securities from us.Prior to August 2008, we originated loans through our legacy mortgage business,primarily first lien home loans, with the intention of selling them. Asubstantial majority of such loans were sold to government-sponsoredenterprises (GSEs) and other purchasers without recourse as to creditdefaults by the borrowers. Two primary types of these non-recourse salesoccurred: so-called whole loan sales to GSEs and others; and sales throughsecuritizations. Whole loan sales were primarily to GSEs but also to otherpurchasers; in those cases we contracted with the buyers directly. Thesecurities issued in the securitizations were backed by the loans sold and weresold to many types of investors including GSEs and federal home loan banks; inthose cases we have contractual relationships with the trustees holding theloans, and we provided investors with information at the time of sale in theform of offering documents. In some cases the whole loans sold by us weresecuritized by the purchaser; we contracted with our purchaser but have norelationship with the securitization trustee or the investors. In 23some cases the loans or securities were insured, as mentioned below,and in those cases we contracted with the insurers. As described below, weretain risk of loss in connection with each of those past relationships, andthat risk varies greatly with the type of relationship.          From 2005through 2008, we originated and sold $69.5 billion original principalamount of first lien mortgage loans to GSEs in whole-loan sales. Althoughadditional GSE whole-loan sales occurred in earlier years, a substantialmajority of GSE repurchase requests (discussed below) have come from the 2005-8period. In addition, from 2000 through 2007, we securitized $47.0 billionoriginal principal amount of first lien mortgage loans. During that period wealso securitized $2.5 billion original principal amount of HELOC andsecond-lien loans without recourse in proprietary transactions (HELOCsecuritizations).           Whole-loanpurchasers have increased their efforts to seek to require loan sellers torepurchase those loans or to reimburse purchasers for losses related to thoseloans when losses are incurred due to actual or alleged failure to strictlyconform to the purchase contract representations or warranties. A substantialmajority of our whole loan sales were to GSEs. The representations andwarranties generally are broader for whole loans sold to the GSEs than they arefor the loans sold in proprietary securitizations. GSE representations andwarranties claims typically include claims that loans had missing orinsufficient file documentation or that loans were obtained through fraud byborrowers or other third parties such as appraisers. As a result, we facepressure from GSE and other whole-loan purchasers to repurchase those loans orto make the purchaser whole, and we face expenses to administer and defendagainst such claims.           For loanssold in proprietary securitizations we have exposure for investment rescissionor damages arising from legal claims that the offering documents under whichthe loans were securitized were materially deficient. At year-end 2011 we werea defendant in a total of four such lawsuits, but others might be brought inthe future. There is also potential repurchase exposure and rescission riskassociated with the proprietary securitizations under the contracts withtrustees through which the securitizations were created. The repurchase processis more difficult for securitization investors than it is for GSEs in wholeloan sales, and at year-end no such requests had been received with respect tofirst-lien mortgage securitizations. At December 31, 2011, based on applicableaccounting guidance associated with litigation, we had no reserve for potentiallosses associated with private first-lien mortgage securitizations.          The HELOCsecuritizations are credit enhanced, or wrapped, by a monoline insurancecompany. Contractual representations and warranties were made to the monolineinsurers, and we have received repurchase requests from a monoline insurerbased on those contractual provisions. A monoline insurer for some of thesesecuritizations has become insolvent, and we are unable to estimate what, ifany, loss exposure that insolvency may create for us. Because of interests weretained, the loans held in our HELOC securitizations generally are recognizedon our balance sheet as restricted assets. Loss content for those loans isevaluated and recognized on our financial statements quarterly within theAllowance for Loan Losses. As a result, if we were to repurchase securitizedHELOC loans the event likely would have little immediate impact on our incomestatement. At December 31, 2011, based on the information available andapplicable accounting guidance, we had no reserve for potential losses associatedwith private HELOC securitizations other than the reserve within the Allowancefor Loan Losses.           Asignificant portion of the loans we sold to GSEs, and some of the loans inproprietary securitizations, were required to have private mortgage insurance(MI). We have received MI cancellation notices from the insurers which wrotethese policies based on claims of fraud or misrepresentations relating to theinsured loans. To date a majority of MI cancellations have involved loans soldto GSEs. Although unresolved MI cancellation notices are not formal repurchaserequests, we include these in the active repurchase request pipeline whenanalyzing and estimating loss content in relation to the loans sold to GSEs.One MI insurer involved with loans we sold reportedly has become insolvent. Wedo not expect its failure to 24create new exposure for us, but it will increase the amount of our lossassociated with any related repurchases.          Our reservefor repurchase losses is assessed quarterly. Although not all loans repurchasedare in arrears or default, as a practical matter many have been. As a result,loss recognition for repurchased loans as a group has been much higher than forconsumer loans typically held in our portfolio. Also, although we re-evaluateour reserves for repurchase losses each quarter, evaluations of that sortnecessarily are estimates and there remains a risk that the reserves will notbe adequate.           Our abilityto predict repurchase losses is adversely affected by both the absence ofsignificant historical precedent for repurchase requests of this scope and ourlack of visibility into current loan information for the majority of the loansthat we sold to GSEs. As a result of the sale of our nationalmortgage banking business in the third quarter of 2008 and later sales ofmortgage servicing rights, we no longerservice the majority of the loans that we sold to GSEs and therefore no longerhave visibility into current loan information. Those facts increase the risk that our reservesmay not reflect our actual ultimate loss.          While thevast majority of claims made to date relate to whole-loan sales to GSEs, claimshave been made with respect to other purchasers and investors. The number ofrepurchase requests, MI cancellation notices, or lawsuits may increasematerially over time. An increase in the volume of such claims beyond what weare currently experiencing, or an increase in the loss rate we experience uponresolution of these claims, could adversely affect our financial condition andresults of operations. Also, starting in 2012 we will be required toperiodically report on repurchase demands and related activities.           Additionalinformation concerning risks related to our former mortgage businesses and ourmanagement of them, all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by thisreference, is set forth under the captions Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and OtherContractual Obligations beginning on page 54, Repurchase andForeclosure Liability beginning on page 60, and Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginning on page 69 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2011Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.          MortgageForeclosure Risks          State and federal officialsand regulators have announced and commenced inquiries and investigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companiesand banks in completing affidavits relating to foreclosures and into the authority of the servicer to foreclose if assignmentsof legal interests in the mortgage loans have not been properly recorded. The attorneys general of all 50 states concluded a jointinvestigation of foreclosure practices across the industry and proposed significant changes in servicing practices related to foreclosuresand substantial penalties. On February 9, 2012, the Justice Department announced that the federal government and attorneys generalof 49 states (the state of Oklahoma reached a separate agreement) had reached a $25 billion settlement agreement with five of thelargest servicers to address mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure abuses. We are not a party to this settlement and our subservicerhas advised us that it has not been involved in recent discussions. Press reports indicate that other subservicers may be approachedto participate in the settlement. Further, President Obama has recently established a mortgage fraud task force to investigatemortgage related issues with its primary focus on mortgage-backed securities and press reports indicate that civil investigativedemands have been issued to a number of servicers. Additional state or federal inquiries or investigations may be commenced. Wecannot predict the ultimate outcome of these inquiries and investigations or the impact that they could have on our financial condition,results of operations, or business.          TheOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) has issued supervisoryguidance regarding consumer foreclosure practices applicable to national banks,including our Bank. The guidance draws upon 25industry regulators recent experience with14 large mortgage servicing companies. The guidance requires our Bank toconduct a self-assessment of its past and present foreclosure practices andsubmit a report to the OCC regarding its outcome. The guidance also requiresour Bank to monitor its first-lien mortgage servicer and servicing vendors, tofollow certain governance practices, and to take corrective action regardingany deficiencies or weaknesses uncovered in the assessment. Corrective actionincludes remediation for customers who have experienced financial harm as aresult of such deficiencies. The ultimate financial impact to our Bank of thisassessment and remediation process is unknown.          Weare aware that some local and state government agencies have begun to assertclaims against mortgage owners, trustees, and servicers related generally tomaintenance of foreclosed and other properties, including in some casesproperties which we own or with which we are otherwise involved. The number andscope of such claims may increase significantly as more foreclosures arecompleted across the U.S. in circumstances where, for market or other reasons,the property is not sold immediately to an unrelated third party.          Additionalinformation concerning foreclosure-related risks and our management of them,all of which is incorporated into this Item 1A by this reference, is set forthunder the captions Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginningon page 60,Foreclosure Practices beginning on page 65, and Repurchase and ForeclosureLiabilitybeginning on page 69 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations section of our 2011 Annual Report toShareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.Reputation Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers,is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and ourfinancial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Ourreputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practicesare perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding thepractices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adverselyimpact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to partieswith whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation.Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring,assessment, and management.          Damageto our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets orotherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract new customersand retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock, couldcreate or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine our ability toattract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts onour reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greaterregulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulationsthat change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result indamage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.Credit Risks          Weface the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that therealizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a charge-off. Wealso face risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, mayfail to honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of creditcharge-offs is unavoidable and overall levels of credit charge-offs can varyover time. Since 2007 our credit charge-offs, especially related to lending, increasedto historically high levels. Although in the past two years our creditcharge-offs have retreated somewhat resulting in a substantial reduction inprovision expense in 2011, at year-end 2011 credit reserves remain elevated byhistorical norms.26          Ourability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess thecreditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value ofany collateral, including real estate. We manage lending credit risk byattempting to diversify our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, and byrecording and managing an allowance for loan losses based on the factorsmentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We alsorecord loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelinesand rules. As indicated in this Item under the caption Accounting Risksbeginning on page 37 of this report, these guidelines and rules couldchange and cause provision expense or charge-offs to increase, or to be recognizedon an accelerated basis, for reasons related or unrelated to the underlyingperformance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positionsapplicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken bythe OCC or other regulators for the Bank. We manage other counterparty creditrisk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other parts of thisItem 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance having toomuch risk concentrated with any one counterparty.          Asignificant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models andapproaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into accountchanges in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and othercollateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on ourexperience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years wehave changed our models and approaches based on changes in circumstances, andwe will continue to do so as conditions change. At times those changes have hadsignificant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. Inaddition, we use those models and approaches to manage our loan portfolios andlending businesses. To the extent our models and approaches are not consistentwith underlying real-world conditions, our management decisions could bemisguided or otherwise adversely affected with substantial adverse consequencesto us. Additional information concerning credit risks and our management ofthem is set forth under the captions Credit Risk Management beginning on page48 and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 67 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationssection of our 2011 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report.Operational Risks          Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon ourability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizationalinfrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with theability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways,including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational,information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer orother technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronicdata and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees orthird parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may presentthemselves in a myriad of ways, and actions taken to manage one risk may beineffective against others. For example, information technology systems may beinsufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other majorcasualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditionsor opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make themless adaptable, and vice-versa.          Oneof the foregoing risks that has become particularly important to financialinstitutions involves electronic systems security. A serious electronicsecurity breach can cause significant damage and at the same time be difficultto detect even after it occurs. Among other things, that damage can occur dueto outright theft of funds, fraud or identity theft perpetrated on customers,or adverse publicity associated with the breach and its potential effects.Perpetrators potentially can be employees, customers, and certain vendors, allof whom legitimately have access to some portion of our systems, as well asoutsiders with no legitimate access. Because of the potentially very seriousconsequences associated with these risks, our 27electronicsystems and their upgrades address internal and external security concerns to ahigher degree than might be true of many companies in other industries, and oursystems have to comply with applicable banking and other regulations pertainingto bank safety and customer protection. Although many of our defenses aresystemic and highly technical, others are much older and more basic. Inparticular, periodically we train all our employees to recognize red flagsassociated with fraud, theft, and other electronic crimes, and we train ourcustomers as well through regular and episodic security-orientedcommunications. We expect our systems and the regulatory requirements tocontinue to evolve as technology and criminal techniques also continue toevolve.          Inaddition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties.Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that couldadversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in somecases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent weincrease our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operationalfunctions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes moredifficult.           Forexample, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage origination and servicingplatforms. We retained significant servicing right assets, however, and wecontinue to originate mortgage products in our regional banking markets in andaround Tennessee. Of practical necessity, we have outsourced our servicingfunctions, and we have outsourced many key roles in the Tennessee-basedmortgage origination process to a third party. In 2011 we transferred ourservicing relationship from the 2008 purchaser of our platform to a new vendor.The complexity and significant cost of that change illustrate the risks andcosts associated with any change in those vendors which provide detailed andsubstantial services to us. Managing the operational, compliance, reputational,liability, and other risks associated with this level of outsourcing in thosebusiness areas is an ongoing challenge for us.          Failureto build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, failure of thatinfrastructure to perform its functions, or failure of our disaster preparednessplans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk ofloss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliance with applicablelaws or regulatory standards. Operational risk is specifically managed throughinternal monitoring, measurement, and assessment by line management andoversight of processes by top management, and by maintaining systems to adhereto regulatory guidance. Additional information concerning operational risks andour management of them appears under the caption Operational Risk Managementbeginning on page 48 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2011 Annual Report toShareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.Service Risks          Weengage in a wide range of activities in which we provide services to customers.These activities create risk of claims against us that the services were providedin a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or were contrary toapplicable laws or rules. These activities include fiduciary, custodial,depositary, funds management, and advisory services, among others. We managethese risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, andsupervision processes.Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks           Weoperate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environment has beenchanging more rapidly in recent years, and the regulatory burdens generallyhave been increasing, as a result of recent events affecting traditionalbanking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. Heightened levelsof regulatory change are likely to continue for at least the next several years.28          Weare subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, securities brokerage andunderwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rulesapplicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and,in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply withapplicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operationalpenalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations mayincrease our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain businessopportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report,beginning on page 5, for additional information concerning financial industryregulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types ofactivities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, weare subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects ofhow we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment andintellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authoritiesincreasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Suchactions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, couldfurther restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, couldaffect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer, orcould materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumerprotection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded tocustomers of financial institutions, restricting our ability to share orreceive customer information and increasing our costs.           Thefollowing paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related tolegal matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risksexhaustively, and they do not describe all legal risks that we face currently.Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish ascircumstances change.          Regulatory and Other Pressures Related to OperatingResults          TheBank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios, asdiscussed under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 8 of thisreport. If the Banks financial losses from recent years past were to resume,or if the regulatory requirements were to increase, then at some point theBanks ability to meet those requirements could be adversely affected. Thoseeffects would be made worse if the regulatory requirements become morestringent, as is expected.          Pressureto maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a weakeconomy may lead to actions that could be dilutive or otherwise adverse to ourshareholders, at least in the short term. Such actions that have occurred inthe past three years include the elimination of our common cash dividend (whichwas reinstated at one cent per share in January 2011), two sales of our commonstock and the issuance of a common stock warrant, and a contraction of ourbalance sheet (involving sales or other dispositions of assets or businesses)at times when market values were depressed. Further such actions could occur.          Recent Legislation: Dodd-Frank Act          TheDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (DF Act)was enacted on July 21, 2010. The DF Act made a substantial number ofsignificant changes to how financial services companies are regulated.Additional information concerning the DF Act is provided in the sectioncaptioned Dodd-Frank Act beginning on page 13 of this report, which sectionis incorporated by reference into this Item 1A.           Manyof the most sweeping changes in the DF Act are not complete or specific butinstead authorize potentially expansive new regulations to be issued in thefuture. At this time it is not known how the DF Act and the regulations thateventually will be adopted under it will affect the financial services industryin general or our company in particular, and it could be several years beforeall the impacts are known. Although it is not possible to summarize in anydetail the effects of this legislation, one likely overall impact29upon us will be to increase our regulatorycompliance and certain other costs significantly. In addition, it is possiblethat our operations and associated revenues will be constrained in somerespects, perhaps significantly in some areas. Areas covered by the DF Actwhich presently appear likely to present the greatest risks to us are mentionedbelow:    Due to the scope of the new regulations authorized, it is likely that our compliance costs will rise appreciably over the next several years, and a substantial portion of that increase likely will be permanent.     Final regulations under the DF Acts so-called Durbin Amendment were issued in 2011. Effective October 1, they severely capped the interchange fees which banks are able to charge merchants for debit card transactions. The cap represents a substantial reduction compared to the rates that prevailed in the market previously.    A new regulatory agency has been created: the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or Bureau. The Bureau has substantial authority over our consumer finance products and services, and therefore is likely to have a substantial impact on our retail financial services businesses. Although presently unknown, the Bureaus rules could conflict with, and possibly override, our Banks primary regulator in consumer matters. Since the Bureaus mission is not focused upon the safety and soundness of our Bank, conflicts of that sort could be significantly adverse to us. The Bureaus rule-making authority is extensive, including such things as setting terms and conditions on consumer products and services and defining deceptive practices. The Bureaus rules could substantially reduce revenues, increase costs and risks, and otherwise make our consumer products and services less profitable or unprofitable. In early 2012 the Bureau began issuing proposed rules; however, the manner in which the Bureaus chief was appointed has called the legal status of those rules into question so that there remains substantial uncertainty regarding how the Bureau ultimately will impact us.    The DF Acts new municipal advisor registration regime could adversely affect our capital markets and other activities with municipal customers.    The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, among other agencies, in 2011 issued a proposal to implement the DF Acts so-called Volcker provisions. The proposal would prohibit financial services companies from engaging in proprietary trading activities and from investing in and sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. Key definitions under the proposal are broad so that the proposal would regulate a wide range of activities. The proposal is far reaching and likely to impact the business operations of many if not most U.S. financial companies. Although at this time the impacts upon us remain highly uncertain, it is possible that the rule, when final, will require us to divest assets or curtail or close business operations. Such actions could have material adverse financial consequences as a result of immediate impacts such as losses realized on sale or closure, and ongoing impacts such as diminished sources of revenues and earnings.    The DF Act is likely to substantially increase our deposit insurance costs. The assessment rate is expected to increase, at least temporarily, and the base upon which the assessment is made has been expanded from insured deposits to include all consolidated assets less tangible capital.    The DF Acts new requirements on mortgage lenders and securitizers could adversely impact our ability to conduct mortgage lending activities, and similarly could impact mortgage-lending banks which are customers of ours.     Regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC, have been given expansive authority to regulate compensation and many other matters throughout our company in connection with enhanced risk regulation functions. If new regulations in this area are severe, they could adversely impact our ability to attract or retain key employees and could make some business activities impractical for banks and bank holding companies.30    The DF Act has excluded certain items, including trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital of financial institutions having assets of $15 billion or more. A direct effect of this exclusion will be to remove $200 million of currently outstanding securities from our Tier 1 capital after a phase-out period has passed.     The DF Act requires the financial regulators to adopt new capital and liquidity standards for institutions having more than $50 billion of assets, which would not include us. The OCC, among other agencies, has proposed stress-testing guidance that would be applicable to us. These changes are expected to be final in 2012. Although the guidance is not intended to implement capital and liquidity requirement changes under the DF Act, it is likely to be coordinated with that effort. Increases in capital and liquidity requirements could increase dilution of common shareholders by requiring stock to be issued and remain outstanding, and could constrain revenues by restricting the amount of capital which can be loaned to customers or put to other highly productive uses.    In 2011 the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted final rules implementing a whistleblower bounty provision of the DF Act. Although it is unknown how this rule will impact us in the future, eventually it is likely to increase our costs of dealing with certain types of employment disputes and it could weaken the effectiveness of our compliance and ethics hotline and other internal reporting processes.    New regulations under the DF Act governing derivatives could adversely affect certain activities of our capital markets business.    There is a risk that the burden of many of the increased compliance costs could be uneven over the industry in terms of the impact to each institutions efficiency ratio (the ratio of costs to revenues), leaving some institutions disadvantaged relative to others. Uneven outcomes could arise because: larger institutions may be able to bear some of the new costs more efficiently due to economies of scale; some new burdens do not apply to smaller institutions at all or are intended to impact community banks much less than regional, national, or international banks; and, there is a risk of unintended impacts. Uneven impact may be inevitable because in most cases each new burden will apply only to a narrow range of activities, institutions have differing mixes of business activities, and the various burdens will be unequal from one activity to the next.          Recent Legislation: Healthcare          In2010 a sweeping healthcare reform law was enacted. Many of the most significantprovisions of this legislation depend upon substantial, and as yet unknown,regulations and other rules, and the application of many provisions are to bephased in over several years, with significant provisions taking effect in2013. Also, the legal validity of the law has been challenged in federal courtand the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to decide those questions in the summerof 2012. Accordingly, the overall impact of the law upon us will not be knownfor some time. However, assuming the law is upheld, at this time it appearslikely that the new law will increase our costs and there is a significant riskthat the increases over time will be substantial.          Federal andState Regulatory Jurisdiction          Formany years the OCC took the position that it was the exclusive regulator ofvarious aspects of national banks or their operating subsidiaries. Thisposition allowed national banks to operate under one set of rules in manyimportant respects. In the past three years that position has been impacted bytwo events. In its 2009 decision known as Cuomov. Clearing House Association L.L.C., the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the OCC does nothave the exclusive ability to enforce certain state and local laws applicableto certain business activities of national banks which are not pre-empted byfederal law. Cuomo holds that theNational Bank Act allows states to enforce non-pre-empted laws through judicialproceedings against 31national banks. In 2010 the DF Act codified the Cuomoholding and created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has certainregulatory powers over national banks in consumer matters. In 2011, actingunder the DF Act, the OCC conformed its pre-emption rule to Cuomoand the requirements of the DF Act regarding visitorial powers and pre-emptionstandards.          Ingeneral, a weakening of federal pre-emption tends to increase our complianceand operational costs and risks, and can increase them substantially. Most statesand some communities have in place various laws pertaining to lending and otherbusiness activities conducted by banks, some of which may not be pre-empted byfederal law. Dealing with potential state and local enforcement activityrelating to non-pre-empted laws would, at a minimum, increase the compliancecosts for national banks that have multi-state operations or a multi-statecustomer base.          LitigationRisks          Weface litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties,and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or stateregulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personneltraining, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethicsprocesses, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitudeof litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with certainty.          Since2008 the risks of certain types of litigation have increased. For us, the mostnotable of those types are (i) lender liability claims, (ii) claims involvingother types of distressed counterparties, including investors in mortgagesecurities sold prior to 2008, (iii) claims based on declines in our stockprice, and (iv) a new type of lender tort claim. The risk from the first twotypes has increased primarily because borrowers and other contractualcounterparties have experienced financial stress, in many cases resulting in anattempt to obtain funds or relief from a solvent party (us). We expect thatthis heightened risk level will not abate until after economic conditions,including residential real estate values, substantially improve. The elevatedrisk associated with type (iii) largely is a result of our volatile stock priceperformance, and eventually should fall back to ordinary levels if volatilityin our stock price moderates.          Regardingtype (iv), some local governments or agencies have claimed that certain lendersin their communities have created a public nuisance, engaged in predatory ordiscriminatory lending, or otherwise are liable for the alleged consequences ofinappropriate consumer lending, especially home mortgage lending. Lender tortclaims of this sort, where alleged damages are measured on a statistical and/orcity-wide basis, create litigation costs immediately and create a risk ofsignificant litigation losses for those lenders which are named as defendantsin them. Moreover, claims of this sort adversely alter the business climate andraise the costs and risks for all lenders, both in the communities involved andin similar communities across the country.Risks of Expense Control           Expensesand other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfullymanage expenses is important to our long-term survival and prosperity. Manyfactors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly theygrow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additionalexpenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolvingbusiness strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manageexpense growth and risk through a variety of means, including selectivelyoutsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordinationand processes, and through an expense management committee.32Geographic Risks          Ourcapital markets business is national in scope, and our capital markets divisionhas a business presence in selected Asian markets. Also, we continue tohold substantial assets across the U.S. originated under our now-discontinuednational lending businesses. However, our traditional banking business remainsgrounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. As a result,although some of our business operations and assets are exposed togeographically broad risks, to a significant degree our banking business isexposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks thatprimarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditionalbanking business. In other words, if the Tennessee region experiences adversitynot shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversityto a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader footprint.Non-U.S. Operations Risks          Wehave two capital markets offices outside of the United States, in Hong Kong andTokyo. Opening and operating non-U.S. offices creates a number of risks.Specific risks associated with any non-U.S. presence include: the risk thattaxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may becreated or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact ourability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets andoperations in a particular country could be nationalized in whole or part withoutadequate compensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could moveunfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or toenlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities, denominated in those currencies;the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited inunexpected ways; risks and costs associated with U.S. banking and otherregulation of non-U.S. business activities; and the risk that political orcultural preferences in a particular host country might become antagonistic toU.S. companies. Our ability to manage those and other risks will depend upon anumber of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipatedifferences in cultural and other expectations applicable to customers, employees,regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties; ourability to recognize and act upon opportunities and constraints peculiar to thecountries and cultures in which our offices operate; our ability to recognizeand manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and our ability toanticipate the stability of or changes in the political, legal, and monetarysystems of the countries in which our offices operate. Insurance          We useinsurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction ofproperty, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not allsuch risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may beinadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For thoserisks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default onits obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat theformer risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurersthat we use and by striving to use more than one insurer whenpractical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or badfaith, is inherent in any contractual situation.          Aportion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If adefault insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were tobecome insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loansinsured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in ourloan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on ourbalance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financialresults. In recent years events of this sort have happened. If many defaultinsurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the riskof a financial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the defaultinsurance industry could curtail our ability to originate new loans that needsuch insurance, which could result in a loss of business for us.33          Inaddition, we own certain bank-owned life insurance policies as assets on ourbooks. Some of those policies are general account and others are separateaccount. The general account policies are subject to the risk that the carriermight experience a significant downgrade or become insolvent. The separateaccount policies are less susceptible to carrier risk, but do carry the risk ofvalue fluctuations in securities which underlie those policies. Both risks aremanaged through periodic reviews of the carriers and the underlying securityvalues. However, particularly for the general account policies, our ability toliquidate a policy in anticipation of an adverse carrier event is significantlylimited by applicable insurance contracts and regulations as well as by asubstantial tax penalty which could be levied upon early policy termination.Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks          Managementof liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additionalinformation concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the captionLiquidity Management beginning on page 51 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2011Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.          Ingeneral, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing businessand, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Ourfunding requirements in 2011 were met principally by deposits and by financingfrom other financial institutions. Historically we also depended upon financingfrom private institutional investors by means of the capital markets. In 2008and 2009 we were not able to utilize the private markets economically, but latein 2010 we issued and sold $500 million of senior notes in an underwrittenoffering which remain outstanding at year-end 2011. The recent past illustrates,however, the risk that capital markets may become unavailable for reasonsbeyond our control. Deposits traditionally have provided our most affordablefunds, and in 2010 and 2011 our deposits trended upward despite thelow-interest-rate environment. However, deposit trends can shift with economicconditions; if the economy improves, deposit levels in our Bank might fall asdepositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higher returns in othervehicles.           Anumber of more general factors could make such funding more difficult, moreexpensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to,our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts onour reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptionsin the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financialservices industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loanportfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatorystructure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economicconditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environmentsgoverning our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds isstrongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies andfinancial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S.government and its agencies, and may become or remain increasingly difficultdue to economic and other factors beyond our control.           Eventsaffecting interest rates, markets, and other factors  mayadversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business.As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings inthat business unit as well. For instance, marketdisruptions in 2007significantly reduced the demand for certain of our capital markets productsand services.          Ratingagencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role,agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. TheCorporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entitiesfor unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reducesavailability and 34increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard &Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. AtDecember 31, 2011, all three rating agencies rated the unsecured senior debt ofthe Corporation and the Bank as investment grade, although we were at or nearthe lowest levels of that grade. To the extent that in the future we depend oninstitutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, wecould experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of funding if our debtratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered below investment grade.In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about ourratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availabilityof funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Pleasenote that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or holdsecurities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should beevaluated independently of any other rating.          Inaddition to the direct liquidity risks noted above, reductions in our creditratings could allow counterparties to terminate and immediately force us tosettle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additionalcollateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. Additionalinformation concerning those matters is provided under the caption DerivativeInstruments within Note 25 to our financial statements, beginning on page 176of our 2011 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material fromthat Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 15 of Part IV ofthis report.          Certainregulatory laws or rules establish minimum capital levels or definerisk-weighting for capital, regulate deposit insurance, and govern relatedfunding matters for banks. Those laws or rules could be changed in a mannerthat could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce our earnings.Significant changes are expected in the next year or two, as mentioned in thenext two paragraphs.          Internationalbanking industry regulators have largely agreed upon significant changes in theregulation of capital required to be held by banks and their holding companiesto support their businesses. The new international rules, known as Basel III,generally increase the capital required to be held, narrow the types ofinstruments which will qualify as providing appropriate capital, and tightenliquidity requirements. The Basel III requirements are complex and will bephased in over many years.           TheBasel III rules do not apply to U.S. banks or holding companies automatically.Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer ProtectionAct of 2010 (DF Act) requires U.S. regulators to reform the system underwhich the safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions,individually and systemically, are regulated. That reform effort will includethe regulation of capital. It is not known to what extent the U.S.regulators will incorporate elements of Basel III into the reformed U.S.regulatory system, but for 2012 it is expected that the U.S. reforms willinclude an increase in capital requirements and a narrowing of what qualifiesas appropriate capital. Although such reforms are likely to impact the verylargest institutions more substantially, we could be impacted as well.           Onelikely effect of a significant tightening of our capital requirements would beto increase our cost of capital, among other things. Any permanent significantincrease in our cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on theprofitability of many of our products, the types of products we could offerprofitably, our overall profitability, and our overall growth opportunities,among other things. Although most financial institutions would be affected,these business impacts could be felt unevenly, depending upon the business andproduct mix of each institution. Other potential effects could include lessability to pay cash dividends and repurchase our common shares, higher dilutionof common shareholders, and a higher risk that we might fall below regulatorycapital thresholds in an adverse economic cycle.35Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks          Asignificant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money.Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues andexpenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. Weactively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in netinterest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additionalinformation concerning those risks and our management of them appears under thecaption Interest Rate Risk Management beginning on page 49 of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2011 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report, and under the caption Interest Rate Risk Management within Note 25 to our financial statements, beginning on page 179 of our 2011 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from the Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 15 of Part IV of this report.          Ourmortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio is affected by changes in interestrates. Although we sold our mortgage servicing platform in 2008, at present westill retain substantial MSR assets. The value of MSR assets declines when theunderlying loans are refinanced, otherwise paid early, or charged off.Generally, when interest rates increase, the value of MSR generally increases,and when rates decline the value of MSR tends to decline. However, thosegeneral tendencies do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; forexample, a decrease in interest rates does not always result in a predictableincrease in refinancings because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtailcredit availability. Additional information concerning those risks and ourmanagement of them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rightsand Other Retained Interests beginning on page 67 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operationssection of our 2011 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report.          Weface the risks associated with movements in the yield curve. The yield curvesimply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. Thecurve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it isflat when short-term rates are nearly equal to long-term rates; and it isinverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yieldcurve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can berelatively flat or inverted for short or even protracted periods. A flat orinverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which wouldadversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand forlong-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of ourcapital markets business. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historicallyis so uncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such amarket condition is reasonably likely to create.          Expectationsby the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements,particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which inturn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is mostapparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected inmarket rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.Securities Inventories and Market Risks          Ourcapital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for itsinstitutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventorypositions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition,we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debtsecurities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities throughcertain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related tocertain interest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks andour management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Managementbeginning on page 47 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2011 Annual Report toShareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been 36incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report,and in the Credit Risks discussion beginning on page 26 of this report.          Inaddition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business andour management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitouschanges in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.          Wehave exposure to risks related to securities markets in other respects as well.We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly orindirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in marketperformance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, andfinancial results.           Amajor example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan sothat it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension fundingobligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims andactuarial estimates of future plan asset values. To a substantial extent thepension plan invests its assets in marketable securities. Our obligations tofund the plan can diminish substantially if the plans investments performwell, and can grow substantially if those investments perform poorly. Changesin those obligations generally translate into positive or negative changes inour pension expense, which in turn affects our financial performance. Althoughour obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many otherthings, including changes in our participating employee population and changesto the plan itself, declines in market performance in recent years have tendedto increase our obligations to fund the pension plan, and that tendency islikely to continue to be felt over the next several years. We announced in 2009that we will implement a freeze of new benefits after 2012, and we changed theasset allocation investment strategy; although we expect these changesto moderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level ofvolatility is unavoidable. That risk of volatility would be amplified ifcertain actuarial assumptions change adversely, especially the discount rateused to estimate the adequacy of assets to cover projected benefits, or if theaccounting rules regarding pension liability estimates change adversely.Hedge Risks          In thenormal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking, capitalmarkets, and legacy mortgage servicing, we attempt to create partial or fulleconomic hedges of various, though not all, financial risks. Our hedgingactivities are discussed in more detail in various places under the followingcaptions of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2011 Annual Report to Shareholders,which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated byreference into Item 7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginningon page 46; and, Critical Accounting Policies, beginning on page 66. Hedgingcreates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to thehedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type ofcredit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from lossas intended (hedge failure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedgefailure could have a significant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings.Accounting Risks          Uncertaintiesin Estimates          Thepreparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significantestimates that affect the financial statements. Three of our most criticalestimates are: the level of the allowance for credit losses; the level ofrepurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure reserves; and the valuation of mortgageservicing rights. However, other estimates occasionally become highlysignificant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and otherloss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; asactual events unfold, estimates are 37adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of theseestimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we maysignificantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain creditlosses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we mayrecognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwill or otherassets, or we may recognize a significant decline in the fair value of ourmortgage servicing rights, or we may make some other adjustment that willdiffer materially from the estimates that we make today. For additionalinformation concerning the sensitivity of these estimates, refer to CriticalAccounting Policies beginning on page 66 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of our 2011Annual Report to Shareholders.          Changes toRules and Practices          Inaddition, accounting rules and practices change over time. Changes inaccounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets,liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generallyaffect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have adisparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operationsof companies within the same industry. For example, in late 2011 U.S. andinternational accounting standards boards reached an accord which wouldsubstantially change how we recognize loss associated with loans. The newstandards, which are not in final form and may not become effective for severalyears, are intended to accelerate recognition of loan loss. Final adoption ofthese new standards could adversely affect our provision for loan loss expense,at least initially, and could make certain loan products less attractive. Risks of Holding our Common Stock           HoldingCompany Dividends          Historicallythe Corporation has depended upon common dividends from the Bank for cash tofund common dividends paid to the Corporations shareholders. However, because Bank dividends to the Corporation exceeded the Bank's net income over the two year period of 2010-2011, regulatoryconstraints may prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividendsto the Corporation in 2012 without regulatory approval. Also, we are required to provide financial support to theBank. Additional information concerning those regulatory restrictions onthe Bank is discussed in more detail under the heading Liquidity Managementin the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section beginning on page 51 of our2011 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated herein byreference.           Furthermore, the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issuedpolicy statements generally requiring insured banks and bank holding companiesonly to pay dividends out of current operating earnings. The Federal Reservehas released a supervisory letter advising bank holding companies, among otherthings, that as a general matter a bank holding company should inform theFederal Reserve and should eliminate, defer or significantly reduce itsdividends if (i) the bank holding companys net income available toshareholders for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paidduring that period, is not sufficient to fully fund the dividends;(ii) the bank holding companys prospective rate of earnings is notconsistent with the bank holding companys capital needs and overall currentand prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holding companywill not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatory capitaladequacy ratios. As mentioned above, at present the capital requirementsapplicable to us are expected to change and it is not clear what those changeswill entail.          In2008 the Corporation discontinued paying a quarterly cash dividend to its commonstockholders and began distributing a dividend payable in shares of commonstock. In 2010 the Corporation returned to profitability, but preferred stockdividends to the Treasury in connection with the TARP program significantlyexceeded those earnings. In January 2011 the Corporation, having exited theTARP program, resumed a cash dividend at the rate of one cent per share,substantially lower than the rate prior to 2008. For 38the reasons mentioned above, our dividend rate may remain muteduntil our earnings are stronger and it becomes clearer how the capitalrequirements applicable to us will change.          Dilution Potential          We may decide to raise additional funds through public orprivate debt or equity financings to fund our operations, to increase ourcapital, or to expand. If we raise funds by issuing equity securities orinstruments that are convertible into equity securities, the percentageownership of our current stockholders will be reduced, the new equitysecurities may have rights and preferences superior to those of the commonstock, and additional issuances could be at sales price which is dilutive tocurrent stockholders. We may also issue equity securities directly asconsideration for acquisitions we may make that could be dilutive to currentstockholders.            Anti-takeover Provisions          Provisions of Tennessee law, and certain provisions ofour charter and bylaws, could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire control of us or could have the effect of discouraging a third partyfrom attempting to acquire control of us. These provisions could make it moredifficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be at aprice attractive to many of our stockholders"

Other factors are those inherent in originating, selling, servicing,and holding loans and loan-based assets including prepayment risks, pricingconcessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing and other real estate prices,fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles.Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System(Federal 19Reserve), Financial IndustryRegulatory Authority (FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), theBureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau), the Financial StabilityOversight Council (Council), and other regulators; regulatory, administrative,and judicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us;and our success in executing our business plans and strategies and managing therisks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ, perhapsmaterially, from those contemplated by the forward-looking statements.           Weassume no obligation to update or revise, whether as a result of newinformation, future events, or otherwise, any forward-looking statements thatare made in this report or in any other statement, release, report, or filingfrom time to time. Actual results could differ and expectations could change,possibly materially, because of one or more factors, including those factorslisted above or presented below, in other sections of this report, or inmaterial incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this reportshould carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, amongothers, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks           Wecompete with other financial services companies for customers. Our primaryareas of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans,wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages andlines of credit, capital markets products and services, and other consumer andbusiness financial products and services. Our competitors in these areasinclude national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations,credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investmentcounseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies andagencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and otherfinancial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. Somecompetitors are banks, subject to the same regulatory regime as we are, whileothers are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different orreduced degree of regulation. We expect that competition will continue to growmore intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightenedcompetition tends to put downward pressure on revenues from affected items,upward pressure on marketing and other promotional costs, or both. Foradditional information regarding competition for customers, refer to theCompetition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 16 of this report.           Wecompete for financial capital. See Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risksbeginning on page 31 of this report for additional information concerning thoserisks.           Wealso compete to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Theprimary tools we use to attract and retain talent are: salaries; commission,incentive, and retention compensation programs; retirement benefits; change incontrol severance benefits; health and other welfare benefits; and ourcorporate culture. To the extent we are unable to use these tools effectively,we face the risk that, over time, our best talent will leave us and we will beunable to replace those persons effectively. Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes           Delinquenciesand credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to anincrease in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateralvalues. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level of creditworthiness),deposit and other products, and financial services may decline during aneconomic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional,or local economic factors that impact demand for loans and other financialproducts and services. Such factors include, for example, changes in interestrates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices.Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local,regional, national, or global) can hurt our 20financial performance in theform of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels,and lower fees from transactions and services.           Since2007, our operating results have been adversely affected by such a weakness inthe economy, especially in real estate markets and commercial lending. In 2010we experienced overall credit quality improvement, but with volatility fromquarter to quarter in some portfolios. For example, at the end of 2010 ourincome commercial real estate portfolio remains stressed and we continue toexpect industry conditions for income commercial real estate to remainstressed. Although we expect those overall and specific trends to continue into2011, that expectation depends upon a continued mild economic recovery, amongother things, which may not occur. If the strength of the U.S. economy ingeneral and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operationsin particular decline, that could result in, among other things, a furtherdeterioration in credit quality, including a resultant adverse effect on ourloan portfolio and allowance for loan losses. Growth and Disposition Risks           Everyorganization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth from 2003 to 2007resulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in bankingbased on our mortgage operations; acquisition of customers from competitorsthat have merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions.In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapidchanges in business conditions. As a result, in 2008 we sold our nationalmortgage platforms, closed our national specialty lending operations, and renewedour emphasis on financial services in our traditional Tennessee-based markets.           Althoughour strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue to change,at present our strategys primary components are to invest capital and other resourcesin our current Tennessee-based retail/commercial banking market footprints, andin our capital markets business. Growth is expected to becoordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Ourgrowth in the past has been primarily organic rather than through substantialacquisitions; in the future, that pattern may shift if appropriateopportunities, within or outside of our current markets, present themselves. Webelieve that the successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number ofkey elements, including:     ●our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our Tennessee-based regional banking market areas; ●in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time identifying and successfully executing upon opportunities to provide new or existing products and services to new or existing customers in the US and overseas; ●our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; ●our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth; and ●our ability to manage any operational, cultural, liquidity or capital risks associated with growth through purchases. We have in place strategiesdesigned to achieve those elements that are significant to us at present. Ourchallenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, or adopt newstrategies, as conditions change.           Tothe extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face variousrisks associated with that practice, including: 21    ●our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the execution, contingency, and other risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately; ●our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively; ●our ability to integrate the franchise value of the acquired company with our own; and, ●our ability to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company.           Attimes a company must consider exiting businesses or units that no longer fitinto managements plans for the future. We have made several exit moves inrecent years and could do so again as we continue to adapt to a changingbusiness and regulatory environment. Key risks associated with exiting abusiness include:     ●our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate acceptable terms; ●our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses; ●our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the exited business had with our retained businesses; and ●our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of an exit that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss. Risks Related to Exited Businesses           In2008 we sold or closed our national mortgage and national specialty lendingbusinesses. However, we retain as assets many of the loans that those businessescreated. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estatesituated across the U.S. We also retain a substantial portion of the mortgageservicing rights that we previously serviced, we continue to maintain hedgepositions that we obtain to manage certain risks related to those retainedservicing rights, and we retain the risk of liability to parties with whom wemade contracts in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assetsand positions continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:     ●The retail and commercial loans on our books from our former national specialty lending business have experienced significantly higher default and loss rates compared to pre-recession years. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured on a second-lien basis in a significant number of cases have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults. Accordingly, a default on such a loan today will result in a much higher loss severity than would have resulted shortly after the loan was originated.  ●The incidence of parties claiming that mortgage loans that we sold to them did not meet contractual standards rose substantially in 2010, and we are defending a few claims brought in 2010 that our disclosures concerning securitized loans were deficient. Those trends may continue in 2011. Additional information concerning this risk appears in Mortgage Repurchase and Related Risks beginning on page 24 of this report.  ●The incidence of counterparty loss on hedges, swaps, and other such instruments associated with mortgage servicing rights may rise as those counterparties experience financial stress or failure.  ●In 2008 we contracted with the purchaser of our national mortgage business to subservice the mortgage loans as to which we retained servicing rights and obligations. In 2011 that contract will expire and we will have to obtain a new subservicer. We expect that our subservicing costs are likely to increase substantially under the terms of anynew agreement relative to the terms of our 2008 agreement.22Other trends adverse to usmay emerge from these legacy assets and positions as counterparties arestressed by economic conditions, and of course some of these impacts apply tocontinuing businesses. Over time those losses and risks related to legacy itemsshould diminish since those exited businesses will not generate new loans andnew contracts, but it is not possible to predict when that may occur. Reputation Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers,is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and ourfinancial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Ourreputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practicesare perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding thepractices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adverselyimpact our reputation. In addition, negative perceptions relating to partieswith whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation.Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring,assessment, and management.           Damageto our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets orotherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract newcustomers and retain existing ones, could impact the market value of our stock,could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and could undermine ourability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverseimpacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also resultin greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws orregulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that resultin damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk. Credit Risks           Weface the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that therealizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss. We alsoface risks that other counterparties, in a wide range of situations, may failto honor their obligations to pay us. In our business some level of credit lossis unavoidable and overall levels of credit loss can vary over time. Since 2007our credit losses, especially related to lending, increased to historicallyhigh levels. Although in recent quarters our credit losses have abated, in 2010credit losses and reserves remained significantly elevated.           Ourability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess thecreditworthiness of loan customers and other counterparties and the value ofany collateral, including real estate. We manage lending credit risk byattempting to diversify our loan portfolio, by managing its granularity, and byrecording and managing an allowance for expected loan losses based on thefactors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. Wealso record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatoryguidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules could change and causecharge-offs to increase for reasons related or unrelated to the underlyingperformance of our portfolio. Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positionsapplicable to our holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken bythe OCC or other regulators for the Bank. We manage other counterparty creditrisk in a variety of ways, some of which are discussed in other parts of thisItem 1A and all of which have as a primary goal the avoidance having too muchrisk concentrated with any one counterparty.           Asignificant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models andapproaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into accountchanges in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and othercollateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on ourexperience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years wehave changed our models and approaches based on changes in circumstances, and wewill continue to do so as conditions change. At times those changes have hadsignificant impacts upon our reported financial results and condition. Inaddition, we use 23those models and approachesto manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. To the extent our modelsand approaches are not consistent with underlying real-world conditions, ourmanagement decisions could be adversely affected with substantial adverseconsequences to us. Additional information concerning credit risks and our managementof them is set forth under the captions Credit Risk Management beginning onpage 55 and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 77 of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report. Mortgage Repurchase and Related Risks           Likemany other financial institutions that originated and sold significant amountsof mortgage loans, we have experienced elevated exposure to repurchaseobligations from investors. Prior to August 2008, we originated loans throughour legacy mortgage business, primarily first lien home loans, with theintention of selling them. A substantial majority of such loans were soldwithout recourse as to credit defaults by the borrowers. From 2005 through2008, we originated and sold $69.5 billion original principal amount of firstlien mortgage loans to government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in so-calledwhole-loan sales. Although additional GSE whole-loan sales occurred in earlieryears, a substantial majority of GSE repurchase requests (discussed below) havecome from that period. In addition, from 2000 through 2007, we securitized$40.8 billion original principal amount of first lien mortgage loans and $2.5billion original principal amount of HELOC loans without recourse inproprietary transactions.           Whole-loanpurchasers have increased their efforts to seek to require loan sellers torepurchase those loans or to reimburse purchasers for losses related to thoseloans when losses are incurred due to actual or alleged failure to strictlyconform to the purchase contract representations or warranties. A substantialmajority of our whole loan sales were to GSEs. The representations andwarranties generally are broader for whole loans sold to the GSEs than they arefor the loans sold in proprietary securitizations. GSE representations andwarranties claims typically include claims that loans that had missing orinsufficient file documentation or that loans were obtained through fraud byborrowers or other third parties such as appraisers. As a result, we faceincreasing pressure from GSE and other whole-loan purchasers to repurchasethose loans or to make the purchaser whole, and we face increasing expenses toadminister and in some cases to defend against such claims. Although we havebeen increasing our reserves for repurchase losses significantly over priorquarters a risk remains that these reserves will not be adequate.           Forloans sold in proprietary securitizations we have exposure for investmentrescission or damages arising from legal claims that the offering documentsunder which the loans were securitized were materially deficient. In 2010 webecame one of many defendants in three such lawsuits, and we have hadinformation subpoenaed in another matter which is not litigation against us atpresent. There is also potential repurchase exposure and rescission riskassociated with the proprietary securitizations under the contracts throughwhich the securitizations were created. The repurchase process is moredifficult for securitization investors than it is for GSEs in whole loan sales,and at year-end no such requests had been received. Additionally, the HELOCsecuritizations are enhanced, or wrapped, by a monoline insurance companythat has certain contractual rights to pursue repurchase. Also, the monolineinsurer for three such securitizations has become insolvent. At December 31,2010, based on applicable accounting guidance associated with pendinglitigation and in light of the absence of any conventional repurchase requests,we had no reserve for potential losses associated with private securitizations.          Asignificant portion of the loans we sold to GSEs, and some of the loans inproprietary securitizations, were required to have private mortgage insurance(PMI). We have experienced a significant increase in the number of rescissionnotices we have received from the insurers which wrote these policies, based onclaims of fraud or misrepresentations relating to the insured loans. To date amajority of 24PMIcancellations have involved loans sold to GSEs. Although unresolved PMIcancellation notices are not formal repurchase requests, we include these inthe active repurchase request pipeline when analyzing and estimating losscontent in relation to the loans sold to GSEs.           Ourability to predict repurchase losses is adversely affected by both the absenceof significant historical precedent for repurchase requests of this scope andour lack of visibility into current loan information for the majority of theloans that we sold to GSEs. As a result of the sale of our national mortgagebanking business in the third quarter of 2008 and later sales of mortgageservicing rights, we no longer service the majority of the loans that we soldto GSEs and therefore no longer have visibility into current loan information.Those facts increase the risk that our reserves may not reflect our actualultimate loss.           Whilethe vast majority of claims made to date relate to whole-loan sales to GSEs, wecould possibly see an increase in claims made with respect to other purchasersand investors, which may increase over time. As a result, the number ofrepurchase requests, PMI cancellation notices, or lawsuits may increasematerially over time. An increase in the volume of such claims beyond what weare currently experiencing, or an increase in the loss rate we experience uponresolution of these claims, could adversely affect our financial condition andresults of operations.           Additionalinformation concerning these risks and our management of them is set forthunder the captions Repurchase Obligations, Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, and Other Contractual Obligationsbeginning on page 61 and Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginning on page 80 ofthe Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report. Operational Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon ourability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizationalinfrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with theability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways,including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational,information technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer orother technology systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronicdata and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees orthird parties; and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may presentthemselves in a myriad of ways, and actions taken to manage one risk may beineffective against others. For example, information technology systems may beinsufficiently redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other majorcasualty, and they may be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditionsor opportunities. Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make themless adaptable, and vice-versa.           Inaddition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties.Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that couldadversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in somecases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent weincrease our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operationalfunctions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes moredifficult.           Forexample, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage origination and servicingplatforms. We retained significant servicing right assets, however, and wecontinue to originate mortgage products in our regional banking markets in andaround Tennessee. Of practical necessity, we outsourced our servicing functionsto the purchaser of our platforms, and since then we have outsourced many keyroles in the Tennessee-based mortgage origination process to a third party.Managing the operational, compliance, 25reputational,liability, and other risks associated with this level of outsourcing in thosebusiness areas is an ongoing challenge for us.           Failureto build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure ofour disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components sufferdamage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, andnoncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk isspecifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessmentby line management and oversight of processes by top management, and bymaintaining systems to adhere to regulatory guidance. Additional informationconcerning operational risks and our management of them appears under thecaption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 54 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report. Service Risks           Weengage in a wide range of activities in which we provide services to customers.These activities create risk of claims against us that the services wereprovided in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or werecontrary to applicable laws or rules. These activities include fiduciary,custodial, funds management, and advisory services, among others. We managethese risks primarily through training programs, compliance programs, andsupervision processes. Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks           Weoperate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environment has beenchanging more rapidly in recent years, and the regulatory burdens generallyhave been increasing, as a result of recent events affecting traditionalbanking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. Heightened levelsof regulatory change are likely to continue for at least the next severalyears.           Weare subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage,securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations inaddition to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S.securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failureto comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural,and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicableregulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certainbusiness opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of thisreport, beginning on page 5, for additional information concerning financialindustry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit thetypes of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. Inaddition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern otheraspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment andintellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authoritiesincreasingly consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Suchactions could further limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, couldfurther restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, couldaffect the terms or profitability of the products and services we offer, orcould materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumerprotection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customersof financial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customerinformation and increasing our costs.           Thefollowing paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related tolegal matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risksexhaustively, and they do not describe all legal risks that we face currently.Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish ascircumstances change. 26          Regulatoryand Other Pressures Related to Operating Results           TheBank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios, asdiscussed under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 8 of thisreport. If the Banks financial losses from recent years were to resume, or ifthe regulatory requirements were to increase, then at some point the Banksability to meet those requirements could be adversely affected. Those effectswould be made worse if the regulatory requirements become more stringent, as isexpected.           Pressureto maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a weakeconomy may lead to actions that could be adverse to our shareholders, at leastin the short term. Such actions that have occurred in the past three yearsinclude the elimination of our common cash dividend (which was reinstated atone cent per share in January 2011), two sales of our common stock and theissuance of a common stock warrant at times when market prices were relativelydisadvantageous, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales orother dispositions of assets or businesses) at times when market values weredepressed. Further such actions could occur.           RecentLegislation: Dodd-Frank Act           TheDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (DF Act)was enacted on July 21, 2010. The DF Act made a substantial number ofsignificant changes to how financial services companies are regulated.Additional information concerning the DF Act is provided in the sectioncaptioned Dodd-Frank Act beginning on page 13 of this report, which sectionis incorporated by reference into this Item 1A.           Manyof the most sweeping changes in the DF Act are not complete or specific butinstead authorize potentially expansive new regulations to be issued in thefuture. At this time it is not known how the DF Act and the regulations thateventually will be adopted under it will affect the financial services industryin general or our company in particular, and it could be several years beforeall the impacts are known. Although it is not possible to summarize in anydetail the effects of this legislation, one likely overall impact upon us willbe to increase our regulatory compliance and certain other costs significantly.In addition, it is possible that our operations and associated revenues will beconstrained in some respects, perhaps significantly in some areas. Areascovered by the DF Act which presently appear likely to present the greatestrisks to us are mentioned below:    ●Due to the scope of the new regulations authorized, it is likely that our compliance costs will rise appreciably over the next several years, and a substantial portion of that increase likely will be permanent.  ●Recently proposed regulations under the DF Acts so-called Durbin Amendment would severely cap the interchange fees which banks charge merchants for debit card transactions. It has been reported that the proposed cap could reduce banking industry reveues from interchange fees by more than 70% on average. Areduction of that scale could cost the Bank $30 million in revenues from interchange fees and could disrupt that business, and is likely to cause the Bank and others in the industry to revamp debit card practices and fee structures. The Bank may not be able to recover all of the revenues lost in the revamping process.  ●There is a risk that the burden of many of the increased compliance costs could be uneven over the industry in terms of the impact to each institutions efficiency ratio (the ratio of costs to revenues), leaving some institutions disadvantaged relative to others. Uneven outcomes could arise because: larger institutions may be able to bear some of the new costs more efficiently due to economies of scale; some new burdens do not apply to smaller institutions at all or are intended to impact community banks much less than regional, national, or international banks; and, there is a risk of unintended impacts. Uneven impact may be inevitable because in most cases each new 27     burden will apply only to a narrow range of activities, institutions have differing mixes of business activities, and the various burdens will be unequal from one activity to the next. ●A new regulatory agency has been created: the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, or Bureau. The Bureau has substantial authority over our consumer finance products and services, and therefore is likely to have a substantial impact on our retail financial services businesses. Although presently unknown, the Bureaus rules could conflict with, and possibly override, our Banks primary regulator in consumer matters. Since the Bureaus mission is not focused upon the safety and soundness of our Bank, conflicts of that sort could be significantly adverse to us. The Bureaus rule-making authority is extensive, including such things as setting terms and conditions on consumer products and services and defining deceptive practices. The Bureaus rules could substantially reduce revenues, increase costs and risks, and otherwise make our consumer products and services less profitable or unprofitable.  ●The DF Acts new municipal advisor registration regime could adversely affect our capital markets and other activities with municipal customers.  ●The DF Act allows banks to pay interest on certain business checking accounts beginning in 2011. If the industry responds by competing for those deposits with interest-bearing accounts, this provision would put some degree of downward pressure upon our net interest margin when it becomes effective.  ●The DF Act is likely to substantially increase our deposit insurance costs. The assessment rate is expected to increase, at least temporarily, and the base upon which the assessment is made has been expanded from insured deposits to include all consolidated assets less tangible capital.  ●The DF Acts new requirements on mortgage lenders and securitizers could adversely impact our ability to conduct mortgage lending activities, and similarly could impact banks which are customers of ours. Regarding that last matter, we provide or facilitate working capital to support the mortgage lending businesses of some of our bank customers; those activities of ours could be harmed if our customers businesses are harmed.  ●Regulators, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the FDIC, have been given expansive authority to regulate compensation and many other matters throughout our company in connection with enhanced risk regulation functions. If new regulations in this area are severe, they could adversely impact our ability to attract or retain key employees and could make some business activities impractical for banks and bank holding companies.  ●The DF Act appears to weaken existing federal pre-emption of state laws which regulate certain banking and financial activities, especially activities involving consumer customers, and it may limit the ability of federal regulators to pre-empt state laws in the future. In general, a weakening of federal pre-emption tends to increase our compliance and operational costs and risks, and can increase them substantially. Additional information on this topic is provided in the section captioned Federal and State Regulatory Jurisdiction beginning on page 29 of this report. ●The DF Act has excluded certain items, including trust preferred securities, from Tier 1 capital of financial institutions having assets of $15 billion or more. A direct effect of this exclusion will be to remove $200 million of currently outstanding securities from our Tier 1 capital after a phase-out period has passed. Perhaps more importantly, this provision could adversely affect our capital markets business in the future, which traditionally has helped other financial institutions issue trust preferred securities.           Recent Legislation: Healthcare          In2010 a sweeping healthcare reform law was enacted. Many of the most significantprovisions of this legislation depend upon substantial, and as yet unknown,regulations and other rules, and the application of many provisions are to bephased in over several years. Accordingly, the overall impact of the law uponus will not be known for some time. However, at this early time it appearslikely that the new law will increase our costs and there is a significant riskthat the increases over time will be substantial. 28          Federaland State Regulatory Jurisdiction           Somestate authorities from time to time have challenged, and on occasion continueto challenge, the position of the OCC that it is the exclusive regulator ofvarious aspects of national banks or their operating subsidiaries. If one ormore of those challenges were successful, or if Congress or the OCC were tochange the applicable banking laws or regulations, we could be impactedsignificantly, due, among other things, to possible increased regulatoryburdens, governmental (including state attorney general) and private partyactions alleging non-compliance with state law, and the expense of tracking andcomplying with the different laws and regulations of those states in which wedo business.           Inits 2009 decision known as Cuomo v. ClearingHouse Association L.L.C., the U.S. Supreme Court determined that theOCC does not have the exclusive ability to enforce certain state and local lawsapplicable to certain business activities of national banks which are notpre-empted by federal law. The Cuomodecision modified the position of the OCC and lower court decisions that hadaffirmed the OCCs regulations regarding its visitorial power, and limited theapplication of a 2007 Supreme Court decision known as Watters v. Wachovia Bank N.A. which hadbeen viewed as indirectly supportive of the OCCs position. Cuomo holds that the National Bank Actallows states to enforce non-pre-empted laws through judicial proceedingsagainst national banks. As discussed in the immediately preceding sectioncaptioned Recent Legislation  Dodd-Frank Act, federal pre-emption of statebanking laws and regulations appears to have been weakened in 2010, though theeffect that legislation remains unclear. Most states and some communities havein place various laws pertaining to lending and other business activitiesconducted by banks, some of which may not be pre-empted by federal law. Dealingwith potential state and local enforcement activity relating to non-pre-emptedlaws would, at a minimum, increase the compliance costs for national banks thathave multi-state operations.           MortgageForeclosure Risks           Stateand federal officials have announced and commenced inquiries and investigationsinto the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks,including us and our subservicer, in completing affidavits relating toforeclosures and into the authority of the servicer to foreclose if assignmentsof legal interests in the mortgage loans have not been properly recorded. Wehave received letters of informal inquiry from a few state attorneys generaland are responding to and cooperating with those inquiries. Additional state orfederal inquiries or investigations may be commenced. We cannot predict at thisearly stage the ultimate outcome of these inquiries and investigations or theimpact that they could have on our financial condition, results of operations orbusiness. Additional information concerning foreclosure-related risks and ourmanagement of them is set forth under the captions Repurchase and Foreclosure Liabilitybeginning on page 71, Foreclosure Practices beginning on page 75, Subserviced Loan Modification Programs beginningon page 76, and Repurchase and Foreclosure Liability beginning on page 80 of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report.           LitigationRisks           Weface litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties,and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or stateregulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personneltraining, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethicsprocesses, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitudeof litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with certainty.           Since2008 the risks of certain types of litigation have increased. For us, the mostnotable of those types are (i) lender liability claims, (ii) claims involvingother types of distressed counterparties, (iii) claims 29basedon declines in our stock price, and (iv) a new type of lender tort claim. Therisk from the first two types has increased primarily because borrowers andother contractual counterparties have experienced financial stress, in manycases resulting in an attempt to obtain funds or relief from a solvent party(us). We expect that this heightened risk level will not abate until aftereconomic conditions substantially improve. The elevated risk associated withtype (iii) largely is a result of our volatile stock price performance in 2007and 2008, and eventually should fall back to ordinary levels if volatility inour stock price remains relatively moderate.           Regardingtype (iv), some local governments or agencies have claimed that certain lendersin their communities have created a public nuisance, engaged in predatory ordiscriminatory lending, or otherwise are liable for the alleged consequences ofinappropriate consumer lending, especially home mortgage lending. Lender tortclaims of this sort, where alleged damages are measured on a statistical and/orcity-wide basis, create litigation costs immediately and create a risk ofsignificant litigation losses for those lenders which are named as defendantsin them. Moreover, claims of this sort adversely alter the business climate andraise the costs and risks for all lenders, both in the communities involved andin similar communities across the country. Risks of Expense Control           Expensesand other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfullymanage expenses is important to our long-term survival and prosperity. Manyfactors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly theygrow. As our businesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additionalexpenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolvingbusiness strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manageexpense growth and risk through a variety of means, including selectivelyoutsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordinationand processes, and through an expense management committee. Geographic Risks           Ourcapital markets business is national in scope, and our capital markets divisionhas a business presence in selected Asian markets. Also, we continue to holdsubstantial assets across the U.S. originated under our now-discontinuednational lending businesses. However, our traditional banking business remainsgrounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. As a result,although some of our business operations and assets are exposed togeographically broad risks, to a significant degree our banking business isexposed to economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks thatprimarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do our traditionalbanking business. In other words, if the Tennessee region experiences adversitynot shared by other parts of the country, we are likely to experience adversityto a degree not shared by those competitors which have a broader footprint. Non-U.S. Operations Risks           Wehave two capital markets offices outside of the United States, in Hong Kong andTokyo. Opening and operating non-U.S. offices creates a number of risks.Specific risks associated with any non-U.S. presence include: the risk thattaxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may becreated or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact ourability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets andoperations in a particular country could be nationalized in whole or partwithout adequate compensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could moveunfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or toenlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities, denominated in those currencies;the risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited inunexpected ways; risks and costs associated with U.S. banking and otherregulation of non-U.S. business activities; and the risk that political orcultural preferences in a particular host country might become 30antagonisticto U.S. companies. Our ability to manage those and other risks will depend upona number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipatedifferences in cultural and other expectations applicable to customers,employees, regulators, vendors, and other business partners and counterparties;our ability to recognize and act upon opportunities and constraints peculiar tothe countries and cultures in which our offices operate; our ability torecognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and ourability to anticipate the stability of or changes in the political, legal, andmonetary systems of the countries in which our offices operate. Insurance           Weuse insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction ofproperty, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not allsuch risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may beinadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For thoserisks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default onits obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat theformer risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurersthat we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. Therisk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherentin any contractual situation.           Aportion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If adefault insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were tobecome insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loansinsured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in ourloan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on ourbalance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results.If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at thesame time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and the disruptionto the default insurance industry could curtail our ability to originate newloans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss of business forus. Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks           Managementof liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additionalinformation concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the captionLiquidity Management beginning on page 58 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           Ingeneral, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing businessand, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results. Ourfunding requirements in 2010 were met principally by deposits and by financingfrom other financial institutions. Historically we also depended upon financingfrom private institutional investors by means of the capital markets. In 2008and 2009 we were not able to utilize the private markets economically, but latein 2010 we issued and sold $500 million of senior notes in an underwrittenoffering. The recent past illustrates, however, the risk that capital marketsmay become unavailable for reasons beyond our control. Deposits traditionallyhave provided our most affordable funds, and in 2010 our deposits were trendingupward despite the low-interest-rate environment. However, deposit trends canshift with economic conditions; if the economy improves, deposit levels in ourBank might fall as depositors become more comfortable with risk and seek higherreturns in other vehicles.           Anumber of more general factors could make such funding more difficult, moreexpensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to,our financial results, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts onour reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptionsin the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financialservices industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loanportfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and 31regulatorystructure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economicconditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environmentsgoverning our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds isstrongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies andfinancial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S.government and its agencies, and may become or remain increasingly difficultdue to economic and other factors beyond our control.           Eventsaffecting interest rates, markets, and other factors which adversely impact ourability or desire to access the capital markets for funding likewise mayadversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business.As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings inthat business unit as well as in our regional banking unit. For instance,disruptions in 2007 that were related to mortgages and mortgage-backed assetssignificantly reduced the demand for certain of our capital markets productsand services and increased the costs and uncertainties associated with ourmortgage servicing portfolio.           Ratingagencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role,agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. TheCorporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entitiesfor unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reducesavailability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating ofBaa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard& Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for manypurposes. At December 31, 2010, all three rating agencies rated the unsecuredsenior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade, although wewere at or near the lowest levels of that grade. To the extent that in thefuture we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for fundingand capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost offunding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered belowinvestment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can createuncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect thecost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook oron watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy,sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, andshould be evaluated independently of any other rating.           Inaddition to the direct liquidity risks noted above, reductions in our creditratings could allow counterparties to terminate and immediately force us tosettle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additionalcollateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. Additionalinformation concerning those matters is provided under the caption DerivativeInstruments within Note 25 to our financial statements, beginning on page191 of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the materialfrom that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 15 of PartIV of this report.           Certainregulatory laws or rules establish minimum capital levels or definerisk-weighting for capital, regulate deposit insurance, and govern relatedfunding matters for banks. Those laws or rules could be changed in a mannerthat could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce our earnings.Significant changes are expected in the next year or two, as mentioned in thenext two paragraphs.           Internationalbanking industry regulators have largely agreed upon significant changes in theregulation of capital required to be held by banks and their holding companiesto support their businesses. The new international rules, known as Basel III,generally increase the capital required to be held,  narrow the types ofinstruments which will qualify as providing appropriate capital, and tighten liquidity requirements. The Basel IIIrequirements are complex and will be phased in over many years.           TheBasel III rules do not apply to U.S. banks or holding companies automatically.Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer ProtectionAct of 2010 (DF Act) requires U.S. regulators to reform the system underwhich the safety and soundness of banks and other financial institutions,individually and systemically, are regulated. That reform effort will includethe regulation of 32 capital. It is not known whether or to what extent the U.S.regulators will incorporate elements of Basel III into the reformed U.S.regulatory system, but it is expected that the U.S. reforms will include anincrease in capital requirements and a narrowing of what qualifies asappropriate capital. One likely effect of a significant tightening of U.S.capital requirements would be to increase our cost of capital, among otherthings. Any permanent significant increase in our cost of capital could havesignificant adverse impacts on the profitability of many of our products, thetypes of products we could offer profitably, our overall profitability, and ouroverall growth opportunities, among other things. Although most financialinstitutions would be affected, these business impacts could be felt unevenly,depending upon the business and product mix of each institution. Otherpotential effects could include less ability to pay cash dividends andrepurchase our common shares, higher dilution of common shareholders, and ahigher risk that we might fall below regulatory capital thresholds in anadverse economic cycle. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks           Asignificant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money.Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues andexpenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. Weactively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in netinterest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additionalinformation concerning those risks and our management of them appears under thecaption Interest Rate Risk Management beginning on page 56 of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report.           Ourmortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio is affected by changes in interestrates. Although we sold our mortgage servicing platform in 2008, at present westill retain substantial MSR assets. The value of MSR assets declines when theunderlying loans are refinanced, otherwise paid early, or charged off.Generally, when interest rates increase, the value of MSR generally increases,and when rates decline the value of MSR tends to decline. However, thosegeneral tendencies do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; forexample, a decrease in interest rates does not always result in a predictableincrease in refinancings because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtailcredit availability. Additional information concerning those risks and ourmanagement of them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR) andOther Related Retained Interests beginning on page 77 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report.           Weface the risks associated with movements in the yield curve. The yield curvesimply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. Thecurve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it isflat when short-term rates are equal, or nearly equal, to long-term rates; andit is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, theyield curve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can berelatively flat or inverted for short or even protracted periods. A flat orinverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which wouldadversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand forlong-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of ourcapital markets business. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historicallyis so uncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such amarket condition is reasonably likely to create.           Expectationsby the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements,particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which inturn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is mostapparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected inmarket rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain. 33Securities Inventories and Market Risks           Ourcapital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for itsinstitutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventorypositions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition,we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debtsecurities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities throughcertain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related tocertain interest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks andour management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Managementbeginning on page 54 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results ofOperations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Report toShareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in theCredit Risks discussion beginning on page 23 of this report.           Inaddition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business andour management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitouschanges in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.          Wehave exposure to risks related to securities markets in other respects as well.We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly orindirectly, to major securities markets. Significant changes in marketperformance can have a material impact upon our assets, liabilities, andfinancial results.           Amajor example of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan sothat it may satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension fundingobligations generally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims andactuarial estimates of future plan asset values. To a substantial extent thepension plan invests its assets in marketable securities. Our obligations tofund the plan can diminish substantially if the plans investments performwell, and can grow substantially if those investments perform poorly. Changesin those obligations generally translate into positive or negative changes inour pension expense, which in turn affects our financial performance. Althoughour obligations and expenses relative to the plan can be affected by many otherthings, including changes in our participating employee population and changesto the plan itself, declines in market performance in recent years have tendedto increase our obligations to fund the pension plan, and that tendency islikely to continue to be felt over the next several years. We announced in 2009that we will implement a freeze of new benefits after 2012, and we changed theasset allocation investment strategy; although we expect these changes tomoderate future volatility in this area, risk of some level of volatility isunavoidable. That risk of volatility would be amplified if certain actuarialassumptions change adversely, especially the discount rate used to estimate theadequacy of assets to cover projected benefits, or if the accounting rulesregarding pension liability estimates change adversely. Venture Capital Assets           Venturecapital investments are inherently volatile. The companies in which we haveinvested are much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typicalpublic company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantial risk of losswhich can be realized suddenly. Venture capital investments also are inherentlyilliquid. Although we have been winding down this business since 2008, thewind-down process is likely to occur over an extended period. At December 31,2010 our venture capital investments had a book value of $13 million. Hedge Risks           Inthe normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking, capitalmarkets, and legacy mortgage servicing, we attempt to create partial or fulleconomic hedges of various, though not all, 34financialrisks. Our hedging activities are discussed in more detail in various placesunder the following captions of the Managements Discussion and Analysis ofResults of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2010 Annual Reportto Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report: RiskManagement, beginning on page 53; and, Critical Accounting Policies,beginning on page 76. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the riskthat the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform(counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and the risk that thehedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk).Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significantadverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Accounting Risks           Uncertaintiesin Estimates           Thepreparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires management to makesignificant estimates that affect the financial statements. Three of our mostcritical estimates are: the level of the allowance for credit losses; the levelof repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure reserves; and the valuation ofmortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionally become highlysignificant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and otherloss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; asactual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherentnature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, wemay significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustaincredit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or wemay recognize a significant provision for impairment of our goodwill or other assets, or we may recognize a significant decline inthe fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, or we may make some otheradjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today.For additional information concerning the sensitivity of these estimates, referto Critical Accounting Policies beginning on page 76 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders.           Changesto Rules and Practices           Inaddition, accounting rules and practices change over time. Changes inaccounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets,liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. Although such changes generallyaffect all companies in a given industry, in practice changes sometimes have adisparate impact due to differences in the circumstances or business operationsof companies within the same industry. Risks of Holding our Common Stock           HoldingCompany Dividends           Historicallythe Corporation has depended upon common dividends from the Bank for cash tofund common dividends paid to the Corporations shareholders. However, in partbecause of the losses experienced by the Bank since 2007, regulatoryconstraints generally will prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividendsto the Corporation in 2011 without regulatory approval. Also, we are requiredto provide financial support to the Bank. Additional information concerningthose regulatory restrictions on the Bank is discussed in more detail under theheading Liquidity Management in the Managements Discussion and Analysissection beginning on page 58 of our 2010 Annual Report to Shareholders, whichsection is incorporated herein by reference. 35          Furthermore,the Federal Reserve and the OCC have issued policy statements generallyrequiring insured banks and bank holding companies only to pay dividends out ofcurrent operating earnings. The Federal Reserve has released a supervisoryletter advising bank holding companies, among other things, that as a generalmatter a bank holding company should inform the Federal Reserve and shouldeliminate, defer or significantly reduce its dividends if (i) the bank holdingcompanys net income available to shareholders for the past four quarters, netof dividends previously paid during that period, is not sufficient to fullyfund the dividends; (ii) the bank holding companys prospective rate ofearnings is not consistent with the bank holding companys capital needs andoverall current and prospective financial condition; or (iii) the bank holdingcompany will not meet, or is in danger of not meeting, its minimum regulatorycapital adequacy ratios.           In2008 the Corporation discontinued paying a quarterly cash dividend to itscommon stockholders and began distributing a dividend payable in shares ofcommon stock. In 2010 the Corporation returned to profitability, but preferredstock dividends to the Treasury in connection with the TARP programsignificantly exceeded those earnings. In January 2011 the Corporation, havingexited the TARP program, resumed a cash dividend at the rate of one cent pershare, substantially lower than the rate prior to 2008. For the reasonsmentioned above, our dividend rate may remain muted until our earnings are strongerand less volatile.           DilutionPotential           Wemay decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equityfinancings to fund our operations, to increase our capital, or to expand. If weraise funds by issuing equity securities or instruments that are convertibleinto equity securities, the percentage ownership of our current stockholderswill be reduced, the new equity securities may have rights and preferencessuperior to those of the common stock, and additional issuances could be atsales price which is dilutive to current stockholders. We may also issue equitysecurities directly as consideration for acquisitions we may make that could bedilutive to current stockholders.           Anti-takeoverProvisions           Provisionsof Tennessee law, and certain provisions of our charter and bylaws, could makeit more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us or could have theeffect of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire control of us.These provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire useven if an acquisition might be at a price attractive to many of ourstockholders"
3,FHN,FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP,2010-02-26,"ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS          ThisItem outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our variousbusinesses to compete, change our risk profile, or materially impact ourfinancial results and condition. Our operating environment continues to evolveand new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have anenterprise-wide risk management committee that oversees processes formonitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiatives designed to manageand control our potential exposure.           Thefollowing discussion highlights risks which could impact us in material ways bycausing our future results to differ materially from our past results, bycausing future results to differ materially from current expectations, or bycausing material changes in our financial condition. In this Item we haveoutlined risks that we believe are important to us at the present time.However, other risks may prove to be important in the future, and new risks mayemerge at any time. We cannot predict with certainty all potential developmentswhich could affect our financial performance or condition. 18Forward-Looking Statements           Thisreport, including materials incorporated into it, may contain forward-lookingstatements with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, andestimates. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not arepresentation of historical information but rather are related to futureoperations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The wordsbelieve, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely,will, going forward, and other expressions that indicate future events andtrends identify forward-looking statements.           Forward-lookingstatements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that areinherently subject to significant business, operational, economic andcompetitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond anycompanys control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisionsand actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change.Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other importantfactors: general and local economic and business conditions, including economicrecession or depression; expectations of and actual timing and amount ofinterest rate movements, including the slope of the yield curve, which can havea significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetaryfluctuations; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, regulatory, andlegislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the financialcondition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outsidethe financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possibleterrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of ourhedging practices; technology; demand for our product offerings; new productsand services in the industries in which we operate; and critical accountingestimates. Other factors are those inherent in lending and holding loan-basedassets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S.housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, andchanges in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), theOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry RegulatoryAuthority (FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and otherregulators; actions of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which has purchasedsecurities from us under its Capital Purchase Program; regulatory,administrative, and judicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulationsapplicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans andstrategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actualresults to differ.           Weassume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that are made inthis report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time totime. Actual results could differ because of one or more factors, includingthose listed above or presented below, in other sections of this report, or inmaterial incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this reportshould carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, amongothers, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks           Wecompete with other financial services companies for customers. Our primaryareas of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans,wealth management, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages andlines of credit, capital markets products and services, and other consumer andbusiness financial products and services. Our competitors in these areasinclude national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations,credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investmentcounseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies andagencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and otherfinancial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. Somecompetitors are banks, subject to the same regulatory regime as we are, whileothers are not banks and in many cases experience a significantly different orreduced degree of regulation. We expect that competition will continue to growmore intense with respect to most of our products and services. Heightenedcompetition tends to put 19downwardpressure on revenues from affected items, upward pressure on marketing andother promotional costs, or both. For additional information regardingcompetition for customers, refer to the Competition heading of PartI, Item 1 beginning on page 15 of this report.           Whilewe face competition for customers, we also compete for financial capital (seeFinancing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 24 of thisreport) and to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Labormarkets change over time. The segments of that market most useful to us may contractwith demographic shifts relating to age, birth rates, education levels,geography, local or regional economic conditions, and other factors. Growth and Disposition Risks           Everyorganization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth from 2003 to 2007resulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in bankingbased on our mortgage operations; acquisition of customers from competitorsthat have merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions.In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapidchanges in business conditions. As a result, in 2008 we sold our nationalmortgage platforms, closed our national specialty lending operations, andrenewed our emphasis on financial services in our traditional Tennessee-basedmarkets. Additional information concerning these matters is presented underRecent Recession and Disruptions beginning on page 32.           Althoughour strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue to change,at present our strategys primary components are to invest capital and otherresources in our current Tennessee-based retail/commercial banking marketfootprints, and in our capital markets business. In any case growth is expectedto be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital.Our growth in the past has been primarily organic rather than throughsubstantial acquisitions; in the future, that pattern may shift ifappropriate opportunities, within or outside of our current markets, presentthemselves. We believe that the successful execution of our strategy dependsupon a number of key elements, including:     ●our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our Tennessee-based regional banking market areas;    ●in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time successfully identifying and exploiting opportunities for new products and services, and for new customers, in the US and overseas;    ●our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;    ●our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth; and    ●our ability to manage the operational, cultural, and (in some cases) liquidity and capital difficulties associated with growth through purchases. We have inplace strategies designed to achieve those elements that are significant to usat present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them, oradopt new strategies, as conditions change.           Tothe extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face variousrisks associated with that practice, including:     ●our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the contingent risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;    ●our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;20    ●our ability to integrate the name recognition and goodwill of the acquired company with our own; and,    ●our ability to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company.           Attimes a company must consider disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses orunits that no longer fit into managements plans for the future. Key risksassociated with dispositions, including closures, include:     ●our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate appropriate terms;    ●our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;    ●our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the disposed or exited business had with our retained businesses; and    ●our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of a closure or other disposition that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss to us. Credit Risks           Weface the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that therealizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss. In ourbusiness some level of credit loss is unavoidable and overall levels of creditloss can vary over time. Since 2007 credit losses increased to historicallyhigh levels, as mentioned in Recent Recession and Disruptions beginningon page 32.           Ourability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess thecreditworthiness of customers and the value of collateral, including realestate. We manage credit risk by attempting to diversify our loan portfolio    and by managing its granularity, and by recording and managing an allowance    for expected loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance    with applicable accounting rules. We also record loan charge-offs in accordance    with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and    rules could change and cause charge-offs to increase for reasons related    or unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio. Moreover, the    SEC could take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that    may be inconsistent with those taken by the OCC or other regulators for the    Bank.           Asignificant challenge for us is to keep the credit and other models andapproaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take into accountchanges in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and othercollateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on ourexperience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. In recent years wehave changed our models and approaches based on changes in circumstances, andwe will do so again. At times those changes have had significant impacts uponour reported financial results and condition. In addition, we use those modelsand approaches to manage our loan portfolios and lending businesses. To theextent our models and approaches are not consistent with underlying real-worldconditions, our management decisions could be adversely affected withsubstantial consequences to the Corporation. Additional information concerningcredit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions CreditRisk Management beginning on page 40, Foreclosure and RepurchaseReserves beginningon page 57, and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 52, ofthe ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report. 21Insurance           Weuse insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction ofproperty, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not allsuch risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may beinadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For thoserisks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default onits obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat theformer risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurersthat we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when practical. Therisk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or bad faith, is inherentin any contractual situation.           Aportion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If adefault insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were tobecome insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loansinsured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loanloss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on ourbalance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financialresults. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvencyat the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and thedisruption to the default insurance industry could curtail our ability tooriginate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss ofbusiness for us. Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes           Delinquenciesand credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to anincrease in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure oncollateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level ofcreditworthiness), deposit and other products, and financialservices may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affectedby other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand forloans and other financial products and services. Such factors include, forexample, changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectationsconcerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverseeconomic change (local, regional, national, or global) can hurt our financialperformance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels,lower deposit levels, and lower fees from transactions and services. Additionalinformation illustrating these risks is given in Recent Recession andDisruptions beginning on page 32. Hedge Risks           Inthe normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking,mortgage, and capital markets, we attempt to create partial or full economichedges of various, though not all, financial risks. Our hedging activities arediscussed in more detail in various places under the following captions of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning on page 31;and,Critical Accounting Policies, beginning on page 52. Hedging createscertain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transactionwill fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), andthe risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedgefailure risk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have asignificant adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings. Service Risks           We    engage in a wide range of activities in which we provide services to customers.    These activities create risk of claims against us that the services were    provided in a manner that harmed the customer or a third party, or were contrary    to applicable laws or rules. These activities include fiduciary, custodial,funds management, and advisory services, among others. We manage these risks    primarily through training programs and supervision processes.Reputation Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers,is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and ourfinancial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Ourreputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those 22practices areperceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practicesof our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adversely impact ourreputation. In addition, adverse perceptions relating to parties with whom wehave important relationships may adversely impact our reputation. Seniormanagement oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, andmanagement.           Damageto our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets orotherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract newcustomers and retain existing ones, could create or aggravate regulatorydifficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talentedemployees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or thereputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/orlegislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change orconstrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to ourreputation also may increase our litigation risk. Operational Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon ourability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizationalinfrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with theability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways,including: errors related to failed or inadequate physical, operational, information    technology, or other processes; faulty or disabled computer or other technology    systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related    security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties;    and exposure to other external events. Inadequacies may present themselves    in a myriad of ways, and actions taken to  manage one risk may be ineffective    for others. For example, information technologies systems may be  insufficiently    redundant to withstand a fire, incursion, or other major casualty, and they    may  be insufficiently adaptable to new business conditions or opportunities.    Efforts to make such systems more robust may also make them less adaptable,    and vice-versa.          Inaddition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties.Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that couldadversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in somecases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent weincrease our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operationalfunctions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes moredifficult.           Forexample, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage origination and servicingplatforms. We retained significant servicing right assets, however, and wecontinue to originate mortgage products in our regional banking markets in andaround Tennessee. Of practical necessity, we have outsourced our servicingfunctions to the purchaser of our platforms, and we have outsourced many keyroles in the Tennessee-based mortgage origination process to a third party. Managingthe operational, compliance, reputational, liability, and other risksassociated with this level of outsourcing in those business areas is an ongoingchallenge for us.           Failureto build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure ofour disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components sufferdamage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, andnoncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk    is specifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessmentby line management and oversight of processes by top management, and bymaintaining systems to adhere to regulatory guidance. Additional informationconcerning operational risks and our management of them appears under thecaption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 40 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report. 23Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks           Managementof liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additional informationconcerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the caption LiquidityManagement beginning on page 34 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           In    general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing business    and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results.    Our funding requirements currently are met principally by deposits and by    financing from other financial institutions, particularly (in 2008 and 2009)    government institutional lending to us under the Term Auction Facility (TAF)    program as well as Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) secured lending. Historically    we also depended upon financing from private institutional investors by means    of the capital markets; however, in 2008 and 2009 we were not able to utilize    the private markets economically, and we are not able to predict when we    will again be able to utilize them economically. Deposits, the TAF program,    and FHLB lending, among other things, have provided funds to us more affordably;    however, the future costs and availability of those funding sources largely    are not within our control. The TAF program is scheduled to be discontinued    in 2010, and by year-end 2009 we had reduced our TAF utilization significantly.    Late in 2008 FDIC deposit insurance coverage was expanded significantly,    but on a temporary basis. Coverage on most accounts increased to $250,000;    that increase is scheduled to expire after 2013. Coverage on certain non-interest    bearing accounts became unlimited; that increase is scheduled to expire in    2010. We believe that those increased coverage levels resulted in some amount    of increased deposit levels; that result could be reversed if the coverage    increases expire.           Anumber of more general factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, orunavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financialresults, organizational or political changes, adverse impacts on    our reputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions    in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financialservices industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loanportfolio or other assets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatorystructure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economicconditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environmentsgoverning our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds isstrongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies andfinancial markets as well as the policies and capabilities of the U.S.government and its agencies, and may become or remain increasingly difficultdue to economic and other factors beyond our control.           Eventsaffecting interest rates, markets, and other factors which adversely impact ourability or desire to access the capital markets for funding likewise mayadversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business.As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings inthat business unit as well as in our regional banking unit. For instance,disruptions in 2007 that were related to mortgages and mortgage-backed assetssignificantly reduced the demand for certain of our capital markets productsand services and increased the costs and uncertainties associated with ourmortgage servicing portfolio.           Ratingagencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role,agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. TheCorporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entitiesfor unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reducesavailability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating ofBaa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard& Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for manypurposes. At the present time, all three rating agencies rate the unsecuredsenior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade, although weare at or near the lowest levels of that grade. To the extent that in thefuture we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for fundingand capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost offunding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered belowinvestment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can createuncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect thecost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook oron watchlist. Please note that 24a creditrating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold securities, is subject torevision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently ofany other rating.           Inaddition to the direct liquidity risks noted above, reductions our in creditratings could allow counterparties to terminate and immediately force us tosettle certain derivatives agreements, and could force us to provide additionalcollateral with respect to certain derivatives agreements. Additionalinformation concerning those matters is provided under the caption DerivativeInstruments within Note 25to our financial statements, beginning on page 148 of our 2009Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 15 of Part IV of this report.          Certainregulatory laws or rules establish minimum capital levels or definerisk-weighting for capital, regulate deposit insurance, and govern relatedfunding matters for banks. Those laws or rules could be changed in a mannerthat could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce our earnings.           Beforewe disposed of our national lending operations, we depended on our ability tosell or securitize first- and second-lien mortgage loans and, prior to 2007,home equity line of credit loans (which we refer to as HELOC), and we dependedupon our ability to sell mortgages and/or mortgage servicing rights. Thoseactions involved the sale of whole loans (sometimes on a servicing-retainedbasis) or of beneficial interests in loans. Going forward, our mortgageorigination activity continues within our Tennessee-based regional bankingfootprint. Most mortgages originated are processed, sold, and serviced on aprivate-label basis through a third party under contract with us. However,risks pertaining to our new loan originations, our retained loans and servicingrights assets, and our former funding activities, continue.           Whenwe sold or securitized mortgage and HELOC loans, we sometimes did so withvarying degrees of recourse, which meant, in effect, that we retained some ofthe risk for the loan if it defaulted. Generally we sold or securitized loanswith no recourse. A loan sold with recourse means the seller retainssubstantial or full responsibility if it defaults. For a loan we sold withoutrecourse, we could still bear responsibility to the buyer in many cases if theloan defaulted early or was paid off early (typically within the first 90days), or if the loan did not conform to representations we made to the buyerat the time of sale. At present, in those cases where we are responsible for    a loan for representation non-conformity, usually we satisfy our obligations    to the buyer by repurchase or by making the buyer whole economically. Typically    we  had similar obligations for breach ofrepresentation, non-conformity, or early default, if the loan was included on    a non-recourse basis in a securitization transaction or loan sale, if thetransaction was a sale of servicing rights, or if we had a make-whole or otherindemnity obligation. Repurchase and make-whole loans (for representation non-conformity)frequently involve default or fraud and therefore frequently result in lossesto us. We managed the risk of non-conformity through origination anddocumentation controls and procedures, and through post-closing quality controlprocesses and repurchase and make-whole request reviews. In recent years we have    experienced an increase in loan repurchases and make-wholes for these reasons;    2009 saw a sharp increase. Management has augmented its review process and    maintains a reserve for losses related to loan repurchases and make-wholes    due to both nonconformity and recourse obligations. Additional information    concerning these risks is set forth under the caption Foreclosure and    Repurchase Reserves beginning on page57 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks           Asignificant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money.Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues andexpenses, and potentially could expand or 25compress ournet interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet to control the risksof a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations    in rates. Additional information concerning those risks and our management    of them appears under the caption Interest Rate Risk Management beginningon page 32 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report.          Ourmortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio is affected by changes in interestrates. Although we sold our mortgage servicing platform in 2008, at present westill retain substantial MSR assets. The value of MSR assets declines when theunderlying loans are refinanced or otherwise paid early. Generally, wheninterest rates increase, the value of MSR generally increases, and when ratesdecline the value of MSR tends to decline. However, those general tendencies    do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; for example, a decreasein interest rates does not always result in a predictable increase inrefinancings because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtail creditavailability. Additional information concerning those risks and our managementof them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights and Other RelatedRetained Interests beginning on page 54 of the Managements Discussionand Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.          Weface the risks associated with movements in the yield curve. The yield curvesimply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. Thecurve is steep when short-term rates are much lower than long-term rates; it isflat when short-term rates are equal, or nearly equal, to long-term rates; andit is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, theyield curve normally is positively sloped. However, the yield curve can berelatively flat or inverted for short or even protracted periods. A flat orinverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, which wouldadversely impact our lending businesses, and it tends to reduce demand forlong-term debt securities, which would adversely impact the revenues of ourcapital markets business. A prolonged inversion of the yield curve historicallyis so uncommon that it is difficult to predict all the effects that such amarket condition is reasonably likely to create.          Expectationsby the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements,particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which inturn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is mostapparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected inmarket rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.Securities Inventories and Market Risks          Ourcapital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for itsinstitutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventorypositions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition,we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debtsecurities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities throughcertain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related tocertain interest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks andour management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Managementbeginning on page 40of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations andFinancial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders, whichis part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by referenceinto Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in the Credit Risks discussionbeginning on page 21of this report.26          Inaddition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business andour management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitouschanges in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.          Wehave exposure to risks related to securities markets in other respects as well.We have a number of assets and obligations that are linked, directly or indirectly,to major securities markets. Significant changes in market performance can havea material impact upon our assets, liabilities, and financial results. A majorexample of that linkage is our obligation to fund our pension plan so that itmay satisfy benefit claims in the future. Our pension funding obligationsgenerally depend upon actuarial estimates of benefits claims and actuarialestimates of future plan asset values. To a substantial extent the pension planinvests its assets in marketable securities. Our obligations to fund the plancan diminish substantially if the plans investments perform well, and can growsubstantially if those investments perform poorly. Changes in those obligationsgenerally translate into positive or negative changes in our pension expense,which in turn affects our financial performance. Although our obligations andexpenses relative to the plan can be affected by many other things, includingchanges in our participating employee population and changes to the plan itself,declines in market performance in recent years will tend to increase ourobligations to fund the pension plan over the next several years. We recentlymodified the plan design and will implement a freeze of new benefits after2012, and we changed the asset allocation investment strategy; we expect thesechanges to moderate future volatility in this area.Venture Capital Risks          Venturecapital investments are inherently volatile. The companies in which we haveinvested are much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typicalpublic company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantial risk ofloss. Venture capital investments also are inherently illiquid. Success in thisbusiness can only be assessed in the long term and depends to a very largeextent upon the ability of management to find sound investment prospects,negotiate financially appropriate investment terms, and oversee each investmentas the company uses the venture capital and develops. In the short term,venture capital losses are not uncommon even if the business proves to besuccessful in the long term. Starting in 2008 we began winding down thisbusiness; however, due to the illiquid nature of these investments, thewind-down process will occur over an extended period.Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks           Weoperate in a heavily regulated industry. The regulatory environment has beenchanging more rapidly in recent years, and the regulatory burdens generallyhave been increasing, as a result of recent events affecting traditionalbanking, mortgage banking, and financial markets generally. We are subject tomany banking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage, securities brokerage andunderwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rulesapplicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and,in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply withapplicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operationalpenalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations mayincrease our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain businessopportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report,beginning on page 5above, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations.Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities inwhich we, as a financial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subjectto a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how weconduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectualproperty. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities increasinglyconsider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions couldfurther limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could furtherrestrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, or couldmaterially affect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumerprotection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded tocustomers of 27financialinstitutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customer informationand increasing our costs.           Thefollowing paragraphs highlight certain specific important risk areas related tolegal matters currently. These paragraphs do not describe these risksexhaustively, and they do not describe all legal risks that we face currently.Moreover, the importance of specific risks will grow or diminish ascircumstances change.          Regulatory and Other Pressures Related to OperatingLosses          TheBank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios, asdiscussed under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 7of this report. If the Banks financial losses continue, or if the regulatoryrequirements were to increase, then at some point the Banks ability tomeet those requirements could be adversely affected.           Pressureto maintain appropriate capital levels and address business needs in a recessionaryenvironment during times of financial lossmay lead to actions that could be adverse to our shareholders, at least in theshort term. Such actions that have already occurred include the elimination ofour common cash dividend, the sale of our common stock and the issuance of acommon stock warrant at times (in 2008) when market prices weredisadvantageous, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales orother dispositions of assets or businesses) at times when market values weredepressed. Further such actions could occur.          Federal andState Regulatory Jurisdiction          Somestate authorities from time to time have challenged, and on occasion continueto challenge, the position of the OCC that it is the exclusive regulator ofvarious aspects of national banks or their operating subsidiaries. If one ormore of those challenges were successful, or if Congress or the OCC were tochange the applicable banking laws or regulations, we could be impactedsignificantly, due, among other things, to possible increased regulatoryburdens, governmental (including state attorney general) and private partyactions alleging non-compliance with state law, and the expense of tracking andcomplying with the different laws and regulations of those states in which wedo business.          Inits 2009 decision known as Cuomo v. ClearingHouse Association L.L.C.,the U.S. Supreme Court determined that the OCC does not have the exclusiveability to enforce certain state and local laws applicable to certain businessactivities of national banks which are not pre-empted by federal law. The Cuomodecision modified the position of the OCC and lower court decisions that hadaffirmed the OCCs regulations regarding its visitorial power, and limited theapplication of a 2007 Supreme Court decision known as Watters v. Wachovia Bank N.A. which hadbeen viewed as indirectly supportive of the OCCs position.          Itis not possible at this time to gauge what effects the Cuomo decision will have upon us. Althoughour regional banking business operates primarily in the state of Tennessee, wehave branches in other states, we have customers in several more, and acomponent of our long-term strategy is possible further expansion into othersoutheastern states. In addition, our capital markets business has customersand offices in many states, and our mortgage banking and national specialtylending businesses hold and service (directly or indirectly) assets originatedacross the U.S.          Cuomoholds that the National Bank Act allows states to enforce non-pre-empted lawsthrough judicial proceedings against national banks. Most states and somecommunities have in place various laws pertaining to lending and other businessactivities conducted by banks, some of which may not be pre-28empted byfederal law. Dealing with potential state and local enforcement activityrelating to non-pre-empted laws would, at a minimum, increase the compliancecosts for national banks that have multi-state operations.          Recent Legislation          In2008 the U.S. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of2008, sometimes known as EESA. Under authority of EESA the U.S. Department of    the Treasury initiated a Capital Purchase Program, sometimes referred to    as the CPP, which has been implemented in conjunction with the U.S. banking    regulators under an umbrella called the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or    TARP. Under the CPP, the Treasury has purchased preferred stock from approved    financial institutions upon terms and conditions set by the Treasury, and    in late 2008 the Treasury purchased preferred stock from us. In February    2009, the U.S. Congress enacted the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act    of 2009 (theRecovery Act), which amended portions of EESA relevant to CPP participants.Additional information concerning our participation in the TARP appears inEESA Legislation and TARP Participation beginning on page 10 of thisreport. Among other things, the Recovery Act significantly restricts incentivecompensation, including bonus and retention awards, for the executives whosecompensation is described in detail in our proxy statement (the named executives)and for the twenty employees, excluding the named executives, whose total compensationis the highest (the Highest 20). Extensive new rules were adoptedby the Treasury in 2009 to implement these new restrictions. The new TARP restrictionson incentives would cease to apply once all of the CPP preferred stock that wesold to the Treasury is redeemed. The TARP rules have created several new risksfor us and for other institutions that sold preferred stock to the Treasury,including the following:    ●Pay Substantially Less Linked to Performance. The TARP restrictions on incentive compensation may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our highest performing employees, and therefore may adversely affect our business. Historically, we have embraced a pay-for-performance philosophy for employees at many levels of the company. Starting in 2010 the restriction on incentives will significantly de-link pay from performance for our named executives. For those de-linked persons, salary will be a larger component of their compensation package. We have responded by paying supplemental salary in the form of salary stock units, which ties the value of the salary increases to the value of our stock. However, the linkage of SSUs to performance is much weaker than is true for our traditional cash bonus programs. It is uncertain how a salary-dominated pay structure for those persons might affect our overall performance during the period in which the TARP restrictions apply to us.     ●Risks if We Desire to Redeem the CPP Preferred. Our redemption of the CPP preferred shares would reduce our regulatory capital and reduce cash on hand. We cannot redeem stock unless our Board and our regulators conclude it is consistent with safety, soundness, and other corporate and regulatory considerations. Those considerations could constrain our ability to redeem the preferred shares, especially in the short term, unless we create or raise an amount of replacement capital determined by our regulators to be acceptable. Creating new capital typically relies upon retaining earnings. Raising new capital could be dilutive to existing shareholders, and it may not be feasible if, at the time we wish to go to market, the market is disrupted or perceives us unfavorably.    ●Interest Rates and Other Economic Changes. The Recovery Act and other legislation in 2009 are expected to result in a substantial increase in government expenditures and government debt for many years to come. It is not clear how those events will affect interest rates or the inflation rate, among other things, but both could rise as a result with adverse effects on the economy. In particular, as mentioned above, our businesses are very sensitive to changes in 29     interest rates and sudden changes in rates often have had an adverse effect on financial services companies.          RecentRegulatory and Legislative Proposals           Atany given time the U.S. Congress, federal regulators, and the states in whichwe do business have pending a host of bills and other proposals that, ifenacted or adopted, could substantially impact our businesses, operations, andfinancial results. Due to political and other processes, it is impossible topredict which proposals will become final and what provisions a final law orrule may have. The following paragraphs highlight, as examples, two recentproposals which could have a substantial impact upon us.    ●The U.S. Congress is considering significant new regulatory reform legislation. The legislation has taken a number of different forms, some of which would significantly alter the regulatory framework applicable to us. Final legislation could incorporate elements from several older bills and could include wholly new provisions. For example, one recent version of regulatory reform legislation would create, among other things, a Consumer Finance Protection Agency (CFPA). If enacted, the CFPA would have substantial authority over our consumer finance products and services. The CFPAs rules could conflict with, and possibly override, our Banks primary regulator in consumer matters. The CFPAs rule-making authority could be extensive, including such things as setting terms and conditions on consumer products services and regulating compensation of our employees who deal with consumer matters. Such rules could substantially reduce revenues, increase costs and risks, and otherwise make our consumer businesses less profitable or unprofitable. In addition, it has been proposed that national banks, including our bank, be made subject to regulation by all the states in a number of respects. At a minimum this partial rescission of federal pre-emption would significantly increase compliance and operating costs, as well as the risk of unintentional non-compliance.    ●The U.S. Congress and other governmental bodies recently have considered, and in the future may enact or adopt, new laws and regulations intended to modify the terms of outstanding consumer loans in a manner benefiting borrowers at the expense of lenders, restrict the ability of lenders to make new loans, and increase the regulatory burdens and legal risks on lenders and loan servicers. Some initiatives in this area have become final but further, and more invasive, measures could be adopted. We have a substantial amount of assets in the form of consumer loans and servicing rights originated in our now-discontinued national businesses; new rules that compel adverse changes in loan terms could have a substantial adverse impact on those portfolios.          LitigationRisks          Weface litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractual parties,and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federal or stateregulators. We manage those risks through internal controls, personneltraining, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethicsprocesses, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitudeof litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with certainty.          Since2008 the risks of certain types of litigation have increased. For us, the mostnotable of those types are (i) lender liability claims, (ii) claims involvingother types of distressed counterparties, (iii) claims based on declines in ourstock price, and (iv) a new type of lender tort claim. The risk from the firsttwo types has increased primarily because borrowers and other contractualcounterparties have experienced financial stress, in many cases resulting in anattempt to obtain funds or relief from a solvent party (us). We expect thatthis heightened risk level will not abate until after economic conditions 30substantiallyimprove. The elevated risk associated with type (iii) largely is a result ofour volatile stock price performance in 2007 and 2008, and eventually shouldfall back to ordinary levels if our stock price continues to stabilize.           Regardingtype (iv), some local governments or agencies have claimed that certain lendersin their communities have created a public nuisance, engaged in predatory ordiscriminatory lending, or otherwise are liable for the alleged consequences ofinappropriate consumer lending, especially home mortgage lending. Lender tortclaims of this sort, where alleged damages are measured on a statistical and/orcity-wide basis, create litigation costs immediately and create a risk ofsignificant litigation losses for those lenders which are named as defendantsin them. Moreover, claims of this sort adversely alter the business climate andraise the costs and risks for all lenders, both in the communities involved andin similar communities across the country. Holding Company Dividends           Historicallythe Corporation has depended upon common dividends from the Bank for cash tofund common dividends paid to the Corporations shareholders. However, inpart because of the losses experienced by the Bank since 2007, regulatoryconstraints generally will prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividendsto the Corporation in 2010 without regulatory approval. Additional informationconcerning those regulatory restrictions on the Bank is discussed in moredetail under the heading Liquidity Management in the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis section beginning on page 34 of our 2009 Annual Reportto Shareholders, which section is incorporated herein by reference. In 2008 theCorporation discontinued paying a quarterly cash dividend to its commonstockholders and began distributing a dividend payable in shares of commonstock. As a TARP participant, we will not be able to reinstate a common cashdividend unless we obtain regulatory consent, among other things. Additionalinformation concerning our participation in the TARP appears in EESA Legislationand TARP Participation beginning on page 10 of this report. Accounting Risks           Uncertainties in Estimates           Thepreparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires management to makesignificant estimates that affect the financial statements. Three of our mostcritical estimates are: the level of the allowance for credit losses; the level    of repurchase, make-whole, and foreclosure reserves; and the valuation of    mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionally become highly    significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and other    loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time;    as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent    nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future,    we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain    credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance,    or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our mortgage    servicing rights, goodwill, or other assets, or we may recognize a significant    decline in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, or we may make    some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that    we make today. For additional information concerning the sensitivity of these    estimates, refer to Critical Accounting Policies beginning    on page 52 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of    Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2009 Annual Report to Shareholders.           Changes to Rules and Practices           Inaddition, accounting rules and practices change over time. Changes inaccounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets,liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings. 31Although suchchanges generally affect all companies in a given industry, in practice changessometimes have a disparate impact due to differences in the circumstances orbusiness operations of companies within the same industry. Risks of Expense Control           Expensesand other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfullymanage expenses is important to our long-term survival. Many factors caninfluence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As ourbusinesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additional expenses canarise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving businessstrategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage expensegrowth and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcingor multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes.Geographic Risks           Ourcapital markets business is national in scope, and our capital markets divisionis developing a business presence in selected Asian markets. Also, we continueto hold substantial assets originated under our now-discontinued nationallending businesses. However, our traditional banking business remains groundedin, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. As a result, although someof our business operations and assets are exposed to geographically broadrisks, to a significant degree our banking business is exposed to economic,regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that primarily impact Tennesseeand neighboring states where we do our traditional banking business. In otherwords, if the Tennessee region experiences adversity not shared by other partsof the country, we are likely to experience adversity to a degree not shared bythose competitors which have a broader footprint. Non-U.S. Operations Risks           Wehave two capital markets offices outside of the United States, in Hong Kong and    Tokyo. Opening and operating non-U.S. offices creates a number of risks.Specific risks associated with any non-U.S. presence include: the risk thattaxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may becreated or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact ourability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets andoperations in a particular country could be nationalized in whole or partwithout adequate compensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could moveunfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or    to enlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities, denominated in those currencies; the    risk that legal recourse against foreign counterparties may be limited in    unexpected ways; risks and costs associated with U.S. banking and other regulation    of non-U.S. business activities; and the risk that political    or cultural preferences in a particular host country might become antagonistic    to U.S. companies. Our ability to manage those and other risks will depend    upon a number of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipate    differences in cultural and other expectations applicable to customers, employees,    regulators, and vendors and other business partners; our ability to recognize    and act upon opportunities and constraints peculiar to the countries and    cultures in which our offices operate; our ability to recognize and manage    any exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and our ability to anticipate    the stability of or changes in the political, legal, and monetary systems    of the countries in which our offices operate. Recent Recession and Disruptions           Startingin 2007 the U.S. economy in general, and the business environment for financialservices companies in particular, experienced a significant recession. Therecession continued throughout 2009, although by years end there were somesigns that the worst aspects might have begun to ease and in some technicalrespects the recession may have ended in 2009. Some geographic areas andbusiness sectors, and some companies and banks, were hurt more than others, orexperienced the downturn at 32differentrates or different times. At this time it is not known, and not possible topredict, the ultimate effects of the recession. Although the recession did notcreate new types of risks, we believe it is useful to highlight in this sectionsome of the key impacts of those events on our business to illustrate howevents beyond our control can adversely affect us.     Key Events of the Recession   Examples of some of the most significant events related to the recession include the following:   Residential housing values in the U.S. fell in nearly every market, and in some highly-populated markets values fell significantly.    The volume of residential housing transactions also stagnated or fell, and in some markets volume fell significantly.    Except for conforming loans, which are loan products conforming to standards of certain government sponsored entities (GSEs), rates for some types of home mortgage products rose sharply and some mortgage products, with new and more restrictive credit criteria, became difficult for borrowers to obtain even at high interest rates, making it difficult or impossible for some borrowers to refinance an existing mortgage.    In 2007 private investor demand for new-issue mortgage-backed securities fluctuated suddenly and sharply, and for some categories of mortgages it disappeared almost entirely. Although this disruption has since moderated somewhat, private-sector demand for new-issue non-conforming mortgage-backed securities has not returned to prior levels.    Many companies in the U.S. in many sectors of the economy reported financial losses or significant reductions in earnings. Banks and other companies in the financial services industry were, in general, especially hard hit. A number of banks failed or were acquired under circumstances of substantial financial stress. Bank failures and acquisitions-under-duress could continue at elevated levels in 2010.    In 2008 the GSEs failed financially and were, in effect, taken over by the federal government. GSEs are the principal outlets for home mortgages in the U.S. Substantial new legislation was enacted during 2008 which changed how the GSEs operate and are regulated. The function of the GSEs as buyers of so-called conforming mortgages has continued under the new laws. In a related move, U.S. monetary policy has kept interest rates, especially home-mortgage rates, at historically low levels. The current functioning of the GSEs and monetary policy are credited with contributing to recent stabilization of real estate values in many parts of the U.S. However, if the GSEs activities and that monetary policy are not maintained in the future, real estate values could destabilize once again.    Unemployment rose as some companies failed and others reduced their staff. Early in 2010 unemployment in the U.S. continues to be elevated on average and in many regions.    Because of these factors, among others, loan defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies rose significantly for U.S. individuals and businesses.    Due to a significant rise in bank failures, the deposit insurance fund administered by the FDIC became depleted. To help maintain the fund, in 2009 the FDIC imposed a special insurance premium and required banks to prepay 3 years of insurance premiums.    In 2008 and 2009 substantial new laws were proposed and, in some cases, enacted, in response to the recession. Some of those applicable to us are mentioned in Regulatory, Legislative, and Legal Risks beginning on page 27 of this report. 33    Key Impacts of the Recession upon the Corporation and the Bank        Exit from National Mortgage and Specialty Lending Businesses               Many of the significant disruptions in 2007 and 2008 impacted our mortgage businesses substantially. We decided to exit those businesses except in our traditional Tennessee-based banking region. In August 2008 we sold our mortgage origination and servicing platforms, and during that year we exited the national specialty lending businesses associated with the mortgage business. These actions had, and will continue to have, a substantial impact upon our financial results and our balance sheet.        Substantial Increase in Losses Related to Lending and Assets from Exited Businesses              Although we sold or closed our national mortgage and national specialty lending businesses, we retain as assets many of the loans that those businesses created. Most of those loans are secured by residential or other real estate situated across the U.S. We also retain a substantial portion of the mortgage servicing rights that we previously serviced, we continue to maintain hedge     positions that we obtain to manage certain risks related to those retained     servicing rights, and we retain the risk of liability to parties with whom     we made contracts in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy     assets and positions continue to impose risks on us. Key risks include:     The loans on our books have experienced significantly higher default and loss rates compared to pre-recession years. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured on a second-lien basis in a significant number of cases have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults. Accordingly, a default on such a loan today will result in a much higher loss severity than would have resulted previously.    The incidence of parties claiming that loans that we sold to them did not meet contractual standards has risen. That trend may persist as parties seek to mitigate losses they experienced while holding those loans by any means possible.    The incidence of counterparty loss on hedges, swaps, and other such instruments may rise as those counterparties experience financial stress or failure.    Other trends adverse to us may emerge from these legacy assets and positions as counterparties are stressed by economic conditions, and of course some of these impacts apply to continuing businesses. Over time those losses and risks related to legacy items should diminish since those exited businesses will not generate new loans and new contracts, but it is not possible to predict when that may occur.            Our other lending businesses remain in place, and we are constantly seeking ways to prudently expand them. We have experienced a significant increase in default and loss rates in most of those products as well, and demand for new loans diminished as business activity in general became more subdued. We adjusted our underwriting, credit review, and loss mitigation processes and we will continue to seek ways to manage risk and minimize loss. However, we remain in the business of lending and that business carries more risk at present than it has in recent years past. That higher level of risk could increase further, and in any case that risk is likely to continue at an elevated level at least until the economy improves significantly in our lending markets.            We regularly review and adjust the allowance for loan losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and nonperforming assets as well as changes in housing price appreciation and depreciation. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complex and requires judgment by management about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. That process was made34 significantly more difficult during the recession as rapid changes in business and economic conditions required us to adjust and re-adjust our methods.        Decrease in Business Activities          Theslowdown reduced business activity, including activity which we finance bymaking loans and activity from which we earn fee revenues. Some activities fellsubstantially or ended completely, notably (for us) certain capital marketsstructured finance activities and certain fee-generating deposit accountactivities. All of these impacts reduce our revenues and our opportunities fornew business.        Net Interest Margin Compression           Relativelylow interest rates in the U.S. could stimulate new demand for consumer andbusiness loans and business activity in general. Low rates could cause therecession to end more quickly and more vigorously than otherwise would be thecase. However, in recent quarters falling rates compressed our net interestmargin, which negatively affected our financial results, and could do so again.       Deposit Run-off Risks          Asmentioned under Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginningon page 24 above, we rely significantly upon deposits for liquidity and to fundour business operations. Generally, deposits are a relatively stable andcost-effective source of funding for banks due to many factors, including FDICdeposit insurance. Changes in deposit levels can be influenced substantiallyby many factors, including customer satisfaction and the interest rates offeredto deposit customers. Those rates, in turn, generally reflect prevailing marketconditions.           During2008, the media occasionally highlighted the risk of an extreme form of depositrun-off, sometimes referred to as a run on the bank. More moderatelevels of run-off can adversely affect banks but are substantially less dramaticand have been significantly less reported. The increased level of public concerncreated by the recession, punctuated by media reports of potential or actualbank failures, increased the risk of some level of deposit run-off for alldepositary institutions. We experienced a degree of run-off in the summer andautumn of 2008 which was not dramatic but could have started a negative trend.Late in 2008 FDIC insurance coverage levels were increased on a temporarybasis; run-off activity abated somewhat, and in fact our deposits grew duringmost of 2009. However, the run-off risk is likely to continue to be elevateduntil it is clear to the public that a significant economic recovery isunderway. Moreover, some degree of deposit run off could occur if FDIC coverageamounts revert to pre-2008 levels. To manage run-off risk we maintain cash reservesand access to other liquidity sources to accommodate normal and, to a degree,unusual withdrawal activity, and we strive to respond promptly and accuratelyto customer concerns that might arise"
2,FHN,FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP,2009-02-26,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS          Thisitem outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our variousbusinesses to compete, change our risk profile, or eventually impact ourfinancial results. The risks we face generally are similar to thoseexperienced, to varying degrees, by all financial services companies. Ouroperating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. Toaddress that challenge we have an enterprise-wide risk management committeethat oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees variousinitiatives designed to manage and control our potential exposure.          Wehave outlined potential risk factors below that we presently believe could beimportant to us; however, other risks may prove to be important in the future.New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict with certainty allpotential developments which could affect our financial performance. Thefollowing discussion highlights potential risks which could intensify over timeor shift dynamically in a way that might change our risk profile. In additionto the factors discussed elsewhere in this report (including the materialincorporated into this report), among the factors that could cause our futureresults to differ materially from our past results and from expectations arethose discussed in this item.Forward-Looking Statements           Thisreport, including materials incorporated into it, may contain forward-lookingstatements with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, andestimates. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not arepresentation of historical information but rather are related to futureoperations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The wordsbelieve, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should,is likely,will, going forward, and other expressions that indicate future events andtrends identify forward-looking statements.           Forward-lookingstatements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that areinherently subject to significant business, operational, economic andcompetitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond anycompanys control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisionsand actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change.Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other importantfactors: general and local economic and business conditions, including economicrecession or depression; expectations of and actual timing and amount ofinterest rate movements, including the slope of the yield curve, which can havea significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetaryfluctuations; inflation or deflation; customer, investor, regulatory, andlegislative responses to any or all of these conditions; the 17financialcondition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outsidethe financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possibleterrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness and cost-efficiency of ourhedging practices; technology; demand for our product offerings; new productsand services in the industries in which we operate; and critical accountingestimates. Other factors are those inherent in lending and holding loan-basedassets including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S.housing and other real estate prices, fluctuation of collateral values, andchanges in customer profiles. Additionally, the actions of the Securities andExchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), theOffice of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of theFederal Reserve System (Federal Reserve), Financial Industry RegulatoryAuthority (FINRA), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and otherregulators; actions of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which has purchasedsecurities from us under its Capital Purchase Program; regulatory,administrative, and judicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulationsapplicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans andstrategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actualresults to differ.           Weassume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that are made inthis report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time totime. Actual results could differ because of one or more factors, includingthose listed above or presented below, in other sections of this report, or inmaterial incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this reportshould carefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, amongothers, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects.Competition Risks          Likeall financial services companies, we compete for customers. Our primary areasof competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealthmanagement, personal or consumer loans including home mortgages and lines ofcredit, capital markets products and services, and other consumer and businessfinancial products and services. Our competitors in these areas includenational, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, creditunions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counselingfirms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies,securities firms, mortgage banking companies, hedge funds, and other financialservices companies that serve the markets which we serve. Some competitors arebanks, subject to the same regulatory regime as we are, while others are not    banks and in many cases experience a significantly different or reduced degree    of regulation. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense    with respect to most of our products and services. For additional informationregarding competition for customers, refer to the Competition headingof Part I, Item 1 beginning on page13 of this report.           Whilewe face competition for customers, we also compete for financial capital (seeFinancing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 22 of thisreport) and to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Labormarkets change over time; the segments of that market most useful to us may contractwith demographic shifts relating to age, birth rates, education levels, geography,local or regional economic conditions, and other factors. Growth and Disposition Risks          Everyorganization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth in recent yearsresulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in bankingbased on our mortgage operations; acquisition of customers from competitorsthat have merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions.In 2007 and 2008 we modified our strategy in response to substantial and rapidchanges in business conditions and to take advantage of certain opportunities.As a result, in 2008 we sold 18our nationalmortgage platforms, closed our national specialty lending operations, andrenewed our emphasis on financial services in our traditional Tennessee-basedmarkets. Additional information concerning these matters is presented underRecent Downturns and Disruptions beginning on page 28.           Althoughour strategy is expected to evolve as business conditionscontinue to change, at present our strategys primary components are to investcapital and other resources in our current Tennessee-based retail/commercialbanking market footprints, and in our capital markets business. In any case growth is expected to be coordinatedwith a focus on stronger and more stable returns on capital. Our growth in thepast has been primarily organic rather than through substantial acquisitions;in the future, that pattern may shift if opportunities presentthemselves. We believe that the successful execution of ourstrategy depends upon a number of key elements, including:    ●our ability to attract and retain banking customers in our Tennessee-based regional banking market areas;    ●in our capital markets business, our ability to maintain or strengthen our existing customer relationships while at the same time successfully identifying and exploiting opportunities for new products and services, and for new customers, in the US and overseas;     ●our ability to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding or enhancing our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently;     ●our ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic growth; and    ●our ability to manage the operational, cultural, and (in some cases) liquidity and capital difficulties associated with growth through purchases.We have in place strategies designed to achieve those elements that aresignificant to us at present. Our challenge is to execute those strategies andadjust them, or adopt new strategies, as conditions change.          Tothe extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face variousrisks associated with that practice, including:    ●our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the contingent risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;     ●our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;    ●our ability to integrate the name recognition and goodwill of the acquired company with our own; and,    ●our ability to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company.          Attimes a company must consider disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses orunits that no longer fit into managements plans for the future. Key risksassociated with dispositions, including closures, include:    ●our ability to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate appropriate terms;    ●our ability to identify and implement key customer, technology systems, and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;     ●our ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the disposed or exited business had with our retained businesses; and    ●our ability to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the event of a closure or other disposition that results in significant cash expenditures or a financial loss to us.19Credit Risks          Likeall other lenders, we face the risk that our customers may not repay theirloans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoida loss. In our business some level of credit loss is unavoidable and overalllevels of credit loss can vary over time. In 2008 credit losses increased tohistorically high levels, as mentioned in Recent Downturns and Disruptionsbeginning on page 28.          Ourability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess thecreditworthiness of customers and the value of collateral, including realestate. We manage credit risk by diversifying our loan portfolio and managingits granularity, and by recording and managing an allowance for expected loanlosses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicableaccounting rules. We also record loan charge-offs in accordance with accountingand regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules could changeand cause charge-offs to increase for reasons related or unrelated to theunderlying performance of our portfolio. This risk is shared with all financialinstitutions. Moreover, the SEC could take accounting positions applicable toour holding company that may be inconsistent with those taken by the OCC orother regulators for the Bank. A significant challenge for us is to keep themodels and approaches we use to originate and manage loans updated to take intoaccount changes in the competitive environment, in real estate prices and othercollateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on ourexperience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Additionalinformation concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forthunder the captions Credit Risk Management beginning on page 37, ForeclosureReserves beginning on page54, and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 47, of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition sectionof our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material fromthat Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II ofthis report.Insurance          Weuse insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction ofproperty, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks. Not allsuch risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance may beinadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable. For thoserisks that are insured, we also face the risks that the insurer may default onits obligations or that the insurer may refuse to honor them. We treat theformer risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurersthat we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when feasible andpractical. The risk of refusal, whether due to honest disagreement or badfaith, is inherent in any contractual situation.          Aportion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If adefault insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were tobecome insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loansinsured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in ourloan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on ourbalance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financialresults. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvencyat the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and thedisruption to the default insurance industry could curtail our ability tooriginate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss ofbusiness for us.Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes           Delinquenciesand credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to anincrease in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure oncollateral values. Likewise, demand for 20loans (at agiven level of creditworthiness), deposit products, fixed income products, andfinancial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may beadversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors thatimpact demand for loans and other financial products and services. Such factorsinclude, for example, changes in interest rates, real estate prices, orexpectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn orother adverse economic change (local, regional, or national) can hurt ourfinancial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan productionlevels, lower deposit levels, and lower fees from transactions and services.These risks are faced by all financial services companies. Additionalinformation illustrating these risks is given in Recent Downturns andDisruptions beginning on page28.Hedge Risks          Inthe normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking,mortgage, and capital markets, we attempt to create partial or full economichedges of various, though not all, financial risks. Our hedging activities arediscussed in more detail in various places under the following captions of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning on page 29;and, CriticalAccounting Policies, beginning on page 47. Hedging creates certain risksfor us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction willfail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), and therisk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failurerisk). Unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significantadverse effect on our liquidity and earnings.Reputation Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers,is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and ourfinancial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Ourreputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practicesare perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding thepractices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adverselyimpact our reputation. In addition, adverse perceptions relating to partieswith whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation.Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring,assessment, and management.          Damageto our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets orotherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract newcustomers and retain existing ones, could create or aggravate regulatorydifficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talentedemployees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or thereputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/orlegislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change orconstrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputationalso may increase our litigation risk.Operational Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon ourability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizationalinfrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with theability to manage a complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways,including: errors related to failed or inadequate processes; faulty or disabledcomputer systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data andrelated security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or thirdparties; and exposure to other external events.21          Inaddition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties.Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that couldadversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in somecases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent weincrease our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operationalfunctions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes moredifficult.           Forexample, in 2008 we sold our national mortgage origination and servicingplatforms. We retained significant servicing right assets, however, and wecontinue to originate mortgage products in our regional banking markets in andaround Tennessee. Of practical necessity, we have outsourced our servicingfunctions to the purchaser of our platforms, and we have outsourced many keyroles in the Tennessee-based mortgage origination process to a third party.Managing the operational, compliance, reputational, liability, and other risksassociated with this level of outsourcing in those business areas is an ongoingchallenge for us.          Failureto build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure ofour disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components sufferdamage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, and noncompliancewith applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk is specificallymanaged through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessment by linemanagement and oversight of processes by top management, and by maintainingsystems to adhere to regulatory guidance. Additional information concerningoperational risks and our management of them appears under the captionOperational Risk Management beginning on page 37 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks          Managementof liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additionalinformation concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the captionLiquidity Management beginning on page 32 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition sectionof our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material fromthat Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II ofthis report.          Ourfunding requirements currently are met principally by deposits and financingfrom other financial institutions. Historically we also depended upon financingfrom institutional investors by means of the capital markets; however, in 2008and continuing into early 2009 we have not been able to utilize those marketseconomically, and we are not able to predict when we will be able to utilize    them again. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs    of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our    financial results.           Anumber of factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, orunavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financialresults, organizational changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes inthe activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets,specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry,counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or otherassets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest ratefluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and thelegal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our fundingtransactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected bythe general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets, andmay become or remain increasingly difficult due to economic and other factorsbeyond our control. 22          Eventsaffecting interest rates, markets, and other factors which adversely impact ourability or desire to access the capital markets for funding likewise mayadversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business.As a result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings inthat business unit as well as in our regional banking unit. For instance, thedisruptions in 2007 and 2008 that were related to mortgages and mortgage-backedassets significantly reduced the demand for certain of our capital marketsproducts and services, and increased the costs and uncertainties associatedwith our mortgage servicing portfolio.          Ratingagencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role,agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. TheCorporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entitiesfor unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reducesavailability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating ofBaa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard& Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for manypurposes. At the present time, all three rating agencies rate the unsecuredsenior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade, although weare at or near the lowest levels of that grade. To the extent that in thefuture we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for fundingand capital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost offunding if our debt ratings were lowered further, particularly if lowered belowinvestment grade. In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can createuncertainty about our ratings in the future and thus can adversely affect thecost and availability of funding, including placing us on negative outlook oron watchlist. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy,sell, or hold securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, andshould be evaluated independently of any other rating.          Regulatorylaws or rules that establish minimum capital levels or define risk-weightingfor capital, regulate deposit insurance, and govern related funding matters forbanks could be changed in a manner that could increase our overall cost ofcapital and thus reduce our earnings.          Beforewe disposed of our national lending operations, we depended on our ability tosell or securitize first- and second-lien mortgage loans and, prior to 2007,home equity line of credit loans (which we refer to as HELOC), and we dependedupon our ability to sell mortgage servicing rights. Those actions involved thesale of whole loans or of beneficial interests in loans. In 2007 the marketsfor loans, loan securitizations, and servicing rights experienced significantdisruptions; additional information concerning that is presented in RecentDownturns and Disruptions beginning on page __ of this report. Going forward,our mortgage origination activity continues within our Tennessee-based regionalbanking footprint. Most mortgages originated are processed, sold, and servicedon a private-label basis through a third party under contract with us. However,risks pertaining to our new loan originations, our retained loans and servicingrights assets, and our former funding activities, continue.           Whenwe sold or securitized mortgage and HELOC loans, we sometimes did so withvarying degrees of recourse, which meant, in effect, that we retained some ofthe risk for the loan if it defaulted. Generally we sold or securitized loanswith no recourse. A loan sold with recourse means the seller retainssubstantial or full responsibility if it defaults. For a loan we sold withoutrecourse, we could still bear responsibility to the buyer in many cases if theloan defaulted early or was paid off early (typically within the first 90days), or if the loan did not conform to representations we made to the buyerat the time of sale. At present, in those cases where we are responsible for aloan for representation non-conformity, usually we satisfy our obligations tothe buyer by repurchase. Typically we had similar obligations for breach ofrepresentation non-conformity, or early default, if the loan was included on anon-recourse basis in a securitization transaction or if the transaction was asale of servicing rights. Loans repurchased for representation non-conformityfrequently involve default or fraud and therefore frequently result in lossesto us. We managed the risk of non-conformity through origination anddocumentation controls and procedures, and through post-closing quality controlprocesses. In 2008 we experienced an increase in 23loanrepurchases for these reasons, particularly with respect to loans originatedunder so-called stated income procedures, and that increase couldcontinue throughout 2009. Management maintains a reserve for losses related toloan repurchases due to both non-conformity and recourse obligations. Additionalinformation concerning these risks is set forth under the caption ForeclosureReserves beginningon page 54 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2008Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks          Asignificant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly,changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, andpotentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. We activelymanage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interestmargin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additional informationconcerning those risks and our management of them appears under the captionInterest Rate Risk Management beginning on page 29 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition sectionof our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material fromthat Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II ofthis report.          Ourmortgage servicing rights (MSR) portfolio is affected by changes in interestrates. Although we sold our mortgage servicing platform in 2008, at present westill retain substantial MSR assets. The value of MSR assets declines when theunderlying loans are refinanced or otherwise paid early. Generally, wheninterest rates increase, the value of MSR generally increases, and when ratesdecline the value of MSR tends to decline. However, those general tendencies    do not result in concrete outcomes in all circumstances; for example, a decreasein interest rates does not always result in a predictable increase inrefinancings because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtail creditavailability. Additional information concerning those risks and our managementof them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights and Other RelatedRetained Interests beginning on page 49 of the Managements Discussionand Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.          Likeall financial services companies, we face the risks associated with movementsin the yield curve. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicableto short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are muchlower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are equal, ornearly equal, to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term ratesexceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is positivelysloped. However, the yield curve can be relatively flat or inverted forshort or even protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends todecrease net interest margin, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debtsecurities, adversely impacting the revenues of our capital markets business. Aprolonged inversion of the yield curve historically is so uncommon that it isdifficult to predict all the effects that such a market condition is reasonablylikely to create. One such effect upon us during a recent inversion period wasan overall increase in the cost of hedging MSR. This cost istied to factors including volatility in the market place, the shape of theyield curve, product duration, risk tolerance and other effects which mayfavorably or unfavorably impact hedging cost.           Expectationsby the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements,particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which inturn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business. That risk is mostapparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected inmarket rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain.24Securities Inventories and Market Risks          Ourcapital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for itsinstitutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventorypositions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition,we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debtsecurities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities throughcertain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related to certaininterest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks and ourmanagement of them appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginningon page 36 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operationsand Financial Condition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders,which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated byreference into Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in the Credit Risksdiscussion beginning on page 20 of this report.          Inaddition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business andour management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitouschanges in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.Venture Capital Risks          Venturecapital investments are inherently volatile. The companies in which we haveinvested are much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typicalpublic company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantial risk ofloss. Venture capital investments also are inherently illiquid. Success in thisbusiness can only be assessed in the long term and depends to a very largeextent upon the ability of management to find sound investment prospects,negotiate financially appropriate investment terms, and oversee each investmentas the company uses the venture capital and develops. In the short term,venture capital losses are not uncommon even if the business proves to besuccessful in the long term. In 2008 we decided to begin winding down thisbusiness; however, due to the illiquid nature of these investments, thewind-down process could be lengthy.Regulatory and Legal Risks           Weoperate in a heavily regulated industry and therefore are subject to manybanking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage, securities brokerage andunderwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rulesapplicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and,in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply withapplicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operationalpenalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations mayincrease our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain businessopportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report,beginning on page 4 above, for additional information concerning financialindustry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit thetypes of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage. Inaddition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern otheraspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment andintellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authoritiesoccasionally consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Suchactions could limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, couldrestrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, or could materiallyaffect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protectionregulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers offinancial institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customerinformation and increasing our costs. In addition, changes in accounting rulescan significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities,revenues, expenses, and earnings.25          TheBank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios, asdiscussed under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 6 of thisreport. If the Bank experiences continuing financial losses, its ability tomeet those requirements could be adversely affected. Pressure to maintaincapital and capital ratios during times of financial loss, especiallyprotracted loss, may lead to actions that are adverse to our shareholders. Suchactions that have already occurred include the elimination of our common cashdividend, the sale of our stock at a time when market prices aredisadvantageous, and a contraction of our balance sheet (involving sales orother dispositions of assets or businesses) at a time when market values aredepressed. Further such actions could occur if losses continue or worsen.          Somestate authorities from time to time have challenged, and on occasion continueto challenge, the position of the OCC that it is the exclusive regulator ofvarious aspects of national banks or their operating subsidiaries. If one ormore of those challenges were successful, or if Congress or the OCC were tochange the applicable banking laws or regulations, we could be impactedsignificantly, due, among other things, to possible increased regulatoryburdens, governmental and private party actions alleging non-compliance withstate law, and the expense of tracking and complying with the different lawsand regulations of those states in which we do business.          Inaddition, some local governments or agencies recently have claimed that certainlenders in their communities have created a public nuisance, engaged inpredatory or discriminatory lending, or otherwise are liable for the allegedconsequences of inappropriate consumer lending, especially home mortgagelending. Mass claims of this sort, where alleged damages are measured on astatistical and/or city-wide basis, create litigation costs immediately andcreate a risk of significant litigation losses for those lenders which arenamed as defendants in them. Moreover, claims of this sort adversely alter the businessclimate and raise the costs for all lenders, both in the communities involvedand in similar communities across the country.          In2008 the U.S. Congress enacted the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of2008, sometimes known as EESA. Under authority of EESA the U.S. Department ofthe Treasury has initiated a Capital Purchase Program, sometimes referred to asthe CPP, which has been implemented in conjunction with the U.S. bankingregulators. Under the CPP, the Treasury has purchased preferred stock fromapproved financial institutions upon terms and conditions set by the Treasury,and in late 2008 the Treasury purchased preferred stock from us. Additionalinformation concerning our participation in the CPP and a debt guaranteeprogram appears in EESA Legislation and TARP Participation beginning on page9 of this report. Other significant programs are expected to be implementedunder EESA, and EESA may be expanded or supplemented by additional legislation.EESA and its announced programs are broad, large, and largely untested. Theseprograms create risks that did not exist previously. Among others, those risksinclude: whether participation in any of these programs will expose us tointrusive, expensive, or counterproductive government mandates or restrictions;whether failure to participate in any particular program, especially if manycompetitors do participate, will put us in a disadvantageous position; and,whether the programs as a whole will have significant unintended or unexpected effectson the financial services industry as a whole, or upon regional financialservices companies in particular.          Wealso face litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractualparties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federalor state regulators. Litigation is an unavoidable part of doing business, andwe seek to manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training,insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and othermeans. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannotbe predicted or controlled with certainty.26Holding Company Dividends          Historicallythe Corporation has depended upon common dividends from the Bank for cash tofund common dividends paid to the Corporations shareholders. However, inpart because of the losses experienced by the Bank for 2007 and 2008,regulatory constraints generally will prevent the Bank from declaring and payingdividends to the Corporation in 2009 without regulatory approval. Additionalinformation concerning those regulatory restrictions on the Bank is discussedin more detail under the heading LiquidityManagement inthe Managements Discussion and Analysis section beginning on page 32 ofour 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, which section is incorporated hereinby reference. In 2008 the Corporation discontinued paying a quarterly cashdividend to common stockholders, and began distributing a dividend payable inshares of common stock. As a CPP participant under EESA, we will not be ableto reinstate a common cash dividend unless we obtain regulatory consent, amongother things. Additional information concerning our participation in the CPPappears in EESA Legislation and TARP Participation beginning on page9 of this report.Accounting Estimate Risks          Thepreparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S.generally accepted accounting principles requires management to makesignificant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of our mostcritical estimates are the level of the allowance for credit losses and thevaluation of mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionallybecome highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigationand other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points intime; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to theinherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in thefuture, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/orsustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the providedallowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of ourmortgage servicing rights, goodwill, or other assets, or we may recognize a significantdecline in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights, or we may make someother adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we maketoday. For additional information concerning the sensitivity of theseestimates, refer to Critical Accounting Policies beginning on page47 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders.Risks of Expense Control           Expensesand other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfullymanage expenses is important to our long-term survival. Many factors caninfluence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As ourbusinesses change, either by expansion or contraction, additional expenses canarise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving businessstrategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage expensegrowth and risk through a variety of means, including selectively outsourcingor multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes.Geographic Risks          Ourcapital markets business is national in scope, and capital markets isdeveloping business in selected Asian markets. Our traditional bankingbusiness remains grounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. Asa result, to a greater degree than many of our competitors that operatenationally or in much broader regions, our banking business currently isexposed to adverse economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks thatmight primarily impact Tennessee and neighboring states where we do business.27Non-U.S. Operations Risks          Wehave two capital markets offices outside of the United States, in Hong Kong andTokyo. Opening and operating non-U.S. offices creates a number of risks.Specific risks associated with any non-U.S. presence include: the risk thattaxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, and other barriers and constraints may becreated or increased by the U.S. or other countries that would impact ourability to operate overseas profitably or at all; the risk that our assets andoperations in a particular country could be nationalized in whole or partwithout adequate compensation; the risk that currency exchange rates could moveunfavorably so as to diminish or destroy the U.S. dollar value of assets, or toenlarge the U.S. dollar value of liabilities, denominated in those currencies;and the risk that political or cultural preferences in a particular host countrymight become antagonistic to U.S. companies. Our ability to manage those andother risks will depend upon a number of factors, including: our ability torecognize and anticipate differences in cultural and other expectationsapplicable to customers, employees, regulators, and vendors and other businesspartners; our ability to recognize and act upon opportunities and constraintspeculiar to the countries and cultures in which our offices operate; ourability to recognize and manage any exchange rate risks to which we areexposed; and our ability to anticipate the stability of or changes in thepolitical, legal, and monetary systems of the countries in which our officesoperate. Recent Downturns and Disruptions          In2007 and 2008 the U.S. economy in general, and the business environment forfinancial services companies in particular, experienced a significant downturn.Examples of some of the most significant events related to the downturn includethe following:    ●Residential housing values in the U.S. have fallen in nearly every market, and in some highly-populated markets values have fallen significantly.    ●The volume of residential housing transactions also has stagnated or fallen, and in some markets volume has fallen significantly.    ●Except for conforming loans, which are loan products conforming to standards of certain government sponsored entities, rates for some types of home mortgage products have risen sharply and some mortgage products, with new and more restrictive credit criteria, have become difficult for borrowers to obtain even at high interest rates, making it difficult or impossible for some borrowers to refinance an existing mortgage.     ●In 2007 investor demand for new-issue mortgage-backed securities fluctuated suddenly and sharply, and for some categories of mortgages it disappeared almost entirely. Although this disruption moderated somewhat in 2008, demand for new-issue non-conforming mortgage-backed securities has not rebounded and seems unlikely to do so for the foreseeable future.    ●Many companies in the U.S. in many sectors of the economy have reported financial losses or significant reductions in earnings during 2008. Banks and other companies in the financial services industry have, in general, been especially hard hit. A number of banks failed, or were acquired under circumstances of substantial financial stress, in 2008.    ●In 2008 the principal outlets for home mortgages in the U.S., the so-called government-sponsored entities (GSEs), failed financially and were, in effect, taken over by the federal government. Substantial new legislation was enacted during 2008 which changed how the GSEs operate and are regulated. Although by the end of 2008 the function of the GSEs as a buyer of so-called conforming mortgages was continuing, the current situation may be transitional and it is not clear what the status or function of the GSEs will be in the future.    ●Unemployment has risen in the latter half of 2008 as some companies have failed and others have reduced their staff.    ●Because of these factors, among others, loan defaults, foreclosures, and bankruptcies have risen significantly for individuals and businesses.28    ●The U.S. Congress enacted sweeping legislation late in 2008, the EESA law mentioned above, under which the Department of the Treasury has invested substantial amounts of capital in banks, including us, and under which government agencies have substantial new powers. At December 31, 2008 EESA had not yet been fully implemented; additional programs could be adopted with unknown consequences to us.    ●Early in 2009 Congress amended the EESA law, enacted a major economic stimulus and spending    law, and is considering specific additional legislation. Members of Congress    have publicly spoken of still other possible legislative actions. Some of    those measures could, if enacted, have a substantially larger impact on us    than EESA and some could have a substantial adverse effect on our business,    operations, and prospects.    ●A U.S. government agency has taken a substantial, possibly a controlling, stake in an American insurance holding company. There has been public speculation that a U.S. government agency could take a similar position in one or more large U.S. banking institutions, rather than let the institution(s) fail. The governments indefinite control and operation of such companies would be, in effect, the nationalization of the affected companies. In addition, the government could exercise control over, or very powerfully influence, the banking and other institutions that receive government aid without completely nationalizing them. The competitive and financial impacts upon us of such actions, whether they applied to us directly or only to certain competing institutions, cannot be predicted but could be significantly adverse to us.     ●The Federal Reserve has lowered certain short-term interest rates. This has triggered reductions in the prime lending rates charged by most U.S. banks and in some cases has adversely affected the net interest margins that banks achieve.          Somegeographic areas and business sectors, and some companies and banks, were hurtmore than others, or experienced the downturn at different rates or differenttimes. However, by the end of 2008 it is clear that the many and variedsignificant events of 2007 and 2008 have become a general and serious economicrecession. At this time it is not known, and not possible to predict, how longor deep this downturn ultimately will be. Although these adverse events did notcreate new types of risks, we believe it is useful to highlight in this sectionsome of the key impacts of those events on our business to illustrate howevents beyond our control can adversely affect us.          Exitfrom National Mortgage and Specialty Lending Businesses          Manyof the significant disruptions in 2007 and 2008 impacted our mortgagebusinesses substantially. We decided to exit those businesses except in ourtraditional Tennessee-based banking region. In August 2008 we sold our mortgageorigination and servicing platforms to MetLife Bank N.A., and during the yearwe exited the national specialty lending businesses associated with themortgage business.          SubstantialIncrease in Losses Related to Loans and Exited Businesses          Althoughwe sold or closed our national mortgage and other lending businesses, we retainas assets many of the loans that those businesses created which we did not sell, or were not able to sell,in the normal course. Most of those loans are secured by residential or otherreal estate situated across the U.S. We also retain a substantial portion ofthe mortgage servicing rights that we previously serviced, we retain the hedgepositions that we obtained to manage certain risks related to those servicingrights, and we retain the risk of liability to parties with whom we madecontracts in the course of operating those businesses. These legacy assets andpositions continue to impose risks on us. For example:29    ●The loans on our books have experienced significantly higher default and loss rates compared to recent years past. For example, due to declining home values, home loans secured on a second-lien basis in some cases have little or no collateral value to cover the loan if it defaults. Accordingly, a default on such a loan today will result in a much higher loss than would have resulted previously. It is not possible to predict when default and loss rates will stabilize.     ●The incidence of parties claiming that loans that we sold to them did not meet contractual standards has risen recently. That trend may continue as parties seek to mitigate losses they experienced while holding those loans by any means possible.    ●The incidence of counterparty loss on hedges, swaps, and other such instruments may rise as those counterparties experience financial stress or failure.Other trendsadverse to us may emerge from these legacy assets and positions ascounterparties are stressed by economic conditions, and of course some of theseimpacts apply to continuing businesses. Over time those losses and risksrelated to legacy items should diminish since there will be many fewer newloans and new contracts, but it is not possible to predict when that may occur.          Ourother lending businesses remain in place, and we are constantly seeking ways toprudently expand them. We are experiencing a significant increase in defaultand loss rates in most of those products as well, and demand for new loans hasdiminished somewhat as business activity in general has become more subdued. Wehave made adjustments to our underwriting, credit review, and loss mitigationprocesses and we will continue to seek ways to manage risk and minimize loss;however, we remain in the business of lending and that business carries morerisk at present than it has in recent years past. That higher level of riskcould increase further, and in any case that risk is likely to continue at anelevated level at least until the economy improves to a significant extent.          Weregularly review and adjust the allowance for loan losses for adequacyconsidering economic conditions and trends, collateral values and creditquality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels of past dueloans and nonperforming assets as well as changes in housing price appreciationand depreciation. Determining the appropriateness of the allowance is complexand requires judgment by management about the effect of matters that areinherently uncertain. That process was made significantly more difficult in2008, as changes in business and economic conditions required us to adjust andre-adjust our methods. If the credit quality of our customer base continues tomaterially weaken, if the risk profile of a market, industry or group ofcustomers continues to change materially, or if the allowance for loan lossesfor any reason is not adequate, our financial condition or results ofoperations could be adversely affected.           Decreasein Business Activities          Theslowdown has reduced business activity, including activity which we finance bymaking loans and activity from which we earn fee revenues. Some activities havefallen off substantially, notably (for us) certain capital markets structuredfinance activities. All of these impacts reduce our revenues and ouropportunities for new business.          NetInterest Margin Compression          Fallinginterest rates in the U.S. could stimulate new demand for consumer and businessloans and business activity in general. However, falling rates could alsocompress our net interest margin, which would negatively affect our financialresults. Moreover, that compression could occur whether or not our loan orother businesses experienced any significant stimulus.30          Depositrun-off risks          Asmentioned under Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginningon page 22 above, we rely significantly upon deposits for liquidity and to fundour business operations. Generally, deposits are a relatively stable andcost-effective source of funding for banks due to many factors, including FDICdeposit insurance. Changes in deposit levels can be influenced substantiallyby many factors, including customer satisfaction and the interest rates offeredto deposit customers. Those rates, in turn, generally reflect prevailing marketconditions. During 2008, the media occasionally highlighted the risk of anextreme form of deposit run-off, sometimes referred to as a run on thebank.More moderate levels of run-off can adversely affect banks but aresubstantially less dramatic and have been significantly less reported. Theincreased level of public concern created by the current adverse businessenvironment, punctuated by media reports of potential or actual bank failures,increased the risk of some level of deposit run-off for all depositaryinstitutions in 2008. That increased run-off risk applies both generally andin relation to deposits that exceed FDIC insurance coverage. Although late in2008 FDIC insurance coverage levels were increased and actual run-off activitywas mitigated, this risk nevertheless is likely to continue at some elevatedlevel until the economic situation becomes more stable. To manage this risk wemaintain cash reserves and access to other liquidity sources to accommodate normaland, to a degree, unusual withdrawal activity, and we strive to respond promptlyand accurately to customer concerns that might arise.          Potentialregulatory and legislative actions may adversely affect mortgage assets           TheU.S. Congress and other governmental bodies have considered, and in the futuremay enact or adopt, new laws and regulations intended to modify the terms ofoutstanding consumer loans in a manner benefiting borrowers at the expense oflenders, restrict the ability of lenders to make new loans, and increase theregulatory burdens and legal risks on lenders and loan servicers. Among otherthings theseinitiatives, if enacted or adopted, could pressure or force us to reduce theinterest and/or principal of loans, delay foreclosure, provide new defenses toforeclosure or otherwise impair our ability to foreclose on a defaultedmortgage loan, adversely affect our rights if a borrower declares bankruptcy,or otherwise adversely affect our rights with respect to borrowers who are indefault or who qualify for such initiatives. The outcome of these initiativesis uncertain.          Recovery Act Risks          In    February 2009, shortly before this Report was filed, the U.S. Congress enacted    the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act).  Additional    information concerning the Recovery Act is provided in EESALegislation & TARP Participation, particularly the last paragraph ofthat section on page 11 of this report. Among other things, the RecoveryAct generally  prohibits incentive compensation, including bonus and retentionawards, for the five executives whose compensation is described in detail inour proxy statement (the named executives) and for the twenty employees,excluding the named executives, whose total compensation is the highest (the Highest20). This restriction on incentives would cease to apply once all of thepreferred stock that we sold to the Treasury is redeemed.  Many interpretivequestions related to the compensation provisions remain unresolved at this earlytime. The Recovery Act has created several new risks for  us and for other institutionsthat sold preferred stock to the Treasury, including  the following:    ●Pay Substantially Less Linked to Performance. The restriction on incentivecompensation in the Recovery Act may adversely affect our ability to attract, retain, and motivate our highestperforming employees, and therefore may adversely affect our business. Historically, we have embraced apay-for-performance philosophy for employees at many levels of the company. The restriction on incentivesmay substantially de-link pay from performance for our named executives and for those employees who are inthe Highest 20 group. For those de-linked persons salary is likely to become the largest component of theircompensation package. It is uncertain how a salary-dominated pay structure for those persons might affect ouroverall performance during the period in which the restriction applies to us. We believe that stronglylinking significant components of pay to performance, particularly at the highest levels, benefits the companyand its shareholders, and that the de-linking described above is likely to be disruptive to that philosophy atthose levels and contrary to the companys best interests.    ●Risks if We Desire to Redeem the Preferred. One way to avoid or mitigate the risks outlined above would be to redeem the preferred shares we sold to the Treasury as soon as possible. However, any redemption would reduce our capital and we cannot redeem stock unless our Board and our regulators conclude it is consistent with safety, soundness, and other corporate and regulatory considerations. Those considerations could constrain our ability to redeem the preferred shares, especially in the short term, unless we create or raise an acceptable amount of replacement capital. Creating new capital typically relies upon retaining earnings. Raising new capital could be significantly dilutive to existing shareholders, especially under current market conditions, and it may not befeasible if, at the time we wish to go to market, the market is disrupted or perceives us unfavorably.    ●Interest Rates and Other Economic Changes. The Recovery Act will result in a substantial increase in government expenditures and could substantially increase government debt. It is not clear how those events will affect interest rates or the inflation rate, among other things, but both could rise as a result of the Act. As mentioned above, our businesses are very sensitive to changes in interest rates and sudden changes in rates often have had an adverse effect on us and other financial services companies. In addition, increased interest rates tend to dampen economic activity; if rates were sustained at relatively high levels the current economic recession could be prolonged or deepened, which would adversely affect our customers and us"
12,FHN,FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP,2008-02-27,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS          Thisitem outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our variousbusinesses to compete, change our risk profile, or eventually impact ourfinancial results. The risks we face generally are similar to thoseexperienced, to varying degrees, by all financial services companies.           Ourstrategies and managements ability to react to changing competitive andeconomic environments have enabled us historically to compete effectively andmanage risks to acceptable levels. However, our operating environment continuesto evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we haveestablished an enterprise-wide risk management committee that overseesprocesses for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiativesdesigned to manage and control our potential exposure.           Wehave outlined potential risk factors below that we presently believe could beimportant to us; however, other risks may prove to be important in the future.New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict with certainty allpotential developments which could affect our financial performance. Thefollowing discussion highlights potential risks which could intensify over timeor shift dynamically in a way that might change our risk profile. In additionto the factors discussed elsewhere in this report (including the materialincorporated into this report), among the factors that could cause our futureresults to differ materially from our past results and from expectations arethose discussed in this item. Forward-Looking Statements           Thisreport, including materials incorporated into it, may contain forward-lookingstatements with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates.Forward-looking statements are statements that are not a representation ofhistorical information but rather are related to future operations, 14strategies,financial results or other developments. The words believe, expect,anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely, will,goingforward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identifyforward-looking statements.           Forward-lookingstatements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that areinherently subject to significant business, operational, economic andcompetitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond anycompanys control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisionsand actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change.Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other importantfactors: general and local economic and business conditions; expectations ofand actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope ofthe yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial servicesinstitution; market and monetary fluctuations; inflation or deflation; customerand investor responses to these conditions; the financial condition ofborrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside thefinancial services industry; geopolitical developments including possibleterrorist activity; natural disasters; effectiveness of our hedging practices;technology; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in theindustries in which we operate; and critical accounting estimates. Otherfactors are those inherent in originating, selling, and servicing loansincluding prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housingprices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles.Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System(Federal Reserve), Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and otherregulators; regulatory, administrative, and judicial proceedings and changes inlaws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing ourbusiness plans and strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing,could cause actual results to differ.           Weassume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that are made inthis report or in any other statement, release, report, or filing from time totime. Actual results could differ because of one or more factors, includingthose presented below, in other sections of this report, or in materialincorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report shouldcarefully consider the factors discussed in this Item below, among others, inevaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks           Likeall financial services companies, we compete for customers. Our primary areasof competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealthmanagement, home mortgage loans and lines of credit, mortgage servicing,capital markets products and services, and other consumer and businessfinancial products and services. Our competitors in these areas includenational, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, creditunions, consumer finance companies, trust companies, investment counselingfirms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies,securities firms, mortgage banking companies, and other financial servicescompanies that serve the markets which we serve. We expect that competitionwill continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products andservices. For additional information regarding competition for customers, referto the Competition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 12 of thisreport.           Whilewe face competition for customers, we also compete for financial capital (seeFinancing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 19 of this report)and to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Labor marketschange over time; the segments of that market most useful to us may contract withdemographic shifts relating to age, birth rates, education levels, geography,local or regional economic conditions, and other factors. Some of the keys toour ability to manage our competitive challenges are: 15    Our leading  position in many of our markets and business lines     Our  historical growth and retention of consumer and business customers     Historically  strong employee value and loyalty ratings and national workplace recognition  resulting in attraction and retention of high performing employees Using thosefactors and others, we have focused on the delivery of products and services ina manner that maximizes the value our customers obtain from their relationshipswith us, and we have developed strategies that have enabled us to gain marketshare in our targeted markets over time. We also have developed strategies toattract customers and talent that are displaced when competitors merge. Growth and Disposition Risks           Everyorganization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth in recent years hasresulted primarily from a combination of: our expansion strategy in banking;acquisition of customers from competitors that have merged with each other; andtargeted non-bank business acquisitions. In 2007 we modified our growthstrategy in response to substantial and rapid changes in business conditionsand to take advantage of certain opportunities.           Althoughour growth strategy is expected to evolve as business conditions continue tochange, at present our strategy has two primary components: to invest capitaland other resources in our current Tennessee-based retail/commercial bankingmarket footprints; and to continue to expand our capital markets business intoa broader range of products, services, and customers. In any case in 2008growth is expected to be coordinated with a focus on stronger and more stablereturns on capital. Our growth has been and at present continues to beprimarily organic rather than through substantial acquisitions. We believe thatthe successful execution of our growth strategy depends upon a number of keyelements, including:     our ability  to attract and retain banking customers in our Tennessee market areas;     in our  capital markets business, our ability to successfully identify and exploit  opportunities for new products and services, and for new customers, in the US  and overseas, while at the same time maintaining or strengthening our  existing customer relationships in that business;    our ability  to develop and retain profitable customer relationships while expanding our  existing information processing, technology, and other operational  infrastructures effectively and efficiently; and    our ability  to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with organic  growth. We have inplace a number of strategies designed to achieve each of those elements. Ourchallenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them as conditions change.           Tothe extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face variousrisks associated with that practice, including:     our ability  to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the contingent risks in the  acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;    our ability  to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and  cost-effectively;    our ability  to integrate the name recognition and goodwill of the acquired company with  our own; and,    our ability  to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company. 16          Attimes a company must consider disposing of or otherwise exiting businesses orunits that no longer fit into managements plans for the future. Key risksassociated with dispositions, including closures, include:     our ability  to price a sale transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate appropriate  terms;    our ability  to identify and implement key customer and other transition actions to avoid  or minimize negative effects on retained businesses;    our ability  to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the disposed or exited  business had with our retained businesses; and    our ability  to manage capital, liquidity, and other challenges that may arise in the  event of a closure or other disposition that results in significant    cash expenditures or a financial loss to us. Credit Risks           Likeall other lenders, we face the risk that our customers may not repay theirloans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoida loss. In our business some level of credit loss is unavoidable and overalllevels of credit loss can vary over time. Our ability to manage credit risksdepends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customersand the value of collateral, including real estate. We control credit risk bydiversifying our loan portfolio and managing its granularity, and by recordingand managing an allowance for expected loan losses based on the factorsmentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We alsorecord loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelinesand rules. These guidelines and rules could change and cause charge-offs toincrease for reasons related or unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio;such changes by the OCC and other banking agencies have been common in recentyears. This risk is shared with all financial institutions. Moreover, the SECcould take accounting positions applicable to our holding company that may beinconsistent with those taken by the OCC or other regulators for the Bank. Themodels and approaches we use to originate and manage loans are regularlyupdated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in realestate prices and other collateral values, and in the economy, among otherthings, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loanportfolios. Additional information concerning credit risks and our managementof them is set forth under the captions Credit Risk Management beginning onpage 34, Foreclosure Reserves beginning on page 47, and Allowance for LoanLosses beginning on page 48, of the Managements Discussion and Analysis ofResults of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Reportto Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Insurance          We    use insurance to manage a number of risks, including damage or destruction    of property, legal and other liability, and certain types of credit risks.    Not all such risks are insured, in any given insured situation our insurance    may be inadequate to cover all loss, and many risks we face are uninsurable.    For those risks that are insured, we also face the risk that the insurer    may default on its obligations or refuse to honor them. We treat the former    risk as a type of credit risk, which we manage by reviewing the insurers    that we use and by striving to use more than one insurer when feasible andpractical. The latter risk is inherent in any contractual situation.          A portion of our retail loan portfolio involves mortgage default insurance. If a default insurer were to experience a significant credit downgrade or were to become insolvent, that could adversely affect the carrying value of loans insured by that company, which could result in an immediate increase in our loan loss provision or write-down of the carrying value of those loans on our balance sheet and, in either case, a corresponding impact on our financial results. If many default insurers were to experience downgrades or insolvency at the same time, the risk of a financial impact would be amplified and the disruption to the default insurance industry could curtail our ability to originate new loans that need such insurance, which would result in a loss of business for us.Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes           Delinquenciesand credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to anincrease in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure oncollateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given level ofcreditworthiness), deposit products, fixed income products, and financialservices may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affectedby other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand forloans and other financial products and services such as (for example) changesin interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates orprices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change(local, regional, or national) can hurt our financial performance in the formof higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, andlower fees from transactions and services. These risks are faced by allfinancial services companies and we have in place processes and tools that webelieve allow us to monitor and manage those risks. 17Hedge Risks           Inthe normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking,mortgage, and capital markets, we attempt to create partial or full economichedges of various, though not all, financial risks. We do that primarily byusing derivative instruments or by engaging in business activities that webelieve are countercyclical to the risks at issue. Our hedging activities arediscussed in more detail in various places under the following captions of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning on page 27; and,Critical Accounting Policies, beginning on page 42. Hedging creates certainrisks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transactionwill fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of credit risk), andthe risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedgefailure risk). Although we actively manage those risks, unexpected counterpartyfailure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on ourliquidity and earnings. Reputation Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers,is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and ourfinancial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Ourreputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practicesare perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding thepractices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adverselyimpact our reputation. In addition, adverse perceptions relating to partieswith whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation.           Damageto our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets orotherwise impact our liquidity, could hamper our ability to attract newcustomers and retain existing ones, could create or aggravate regulatorydifficulties, and could undermine our ability to attract and retain talentedemployees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or thereputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/orlegislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that change orconstrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to ourreputation also may increase our litigation risk.           Aswith all other risks, we actively devote significant resources to safeguard ourreputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation riskmonitoring, assessment, and management. Operational Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses is dependent in part upon ourability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizationalinfrastructure, manage expenses, and recruit and retain personnel with theability to manage an increasingly complex business. Operational risk can arisein many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate processes;faulty or disabled computer systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches,electronic data and related security breaches, or other criminal conduct byemployees or third parties; and exposure to other external events.           Inaddition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties.Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that couldadversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and, in somecases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent weincrease our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operationalfunctions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes moredifficult. 18          Failureto build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure ofour disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components sufferdamage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions, ornoncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk isspecifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessmentby line management and oversight of processes by top management. Operationalrisk also is mitigated by following regulatory guidance. Additional informationconcerning operational risks and our management of them appears under thecaption Operational Risk Management beginning on page 34 of the ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of thematerial from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7of Part II of this report. Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks           Managementof liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additionalinformation concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the captionLiquidity Management beginning on page 30 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report thathas been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           Ourfunding requirements currently are met principally by deposits, financing fromother financial institutions, and financing from institutional investors bymeans of the capital markets. In general, the costs of our funding directlyimpact our costs of doing business and, therefore, can positively or negativelyaffect our financial results.           Anumber of factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, orunavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financialresults, organizational changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes inthe activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets,specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry,counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or otherassets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest ratefluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and thelegal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our fundingtransactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected bythe general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets, andmay become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors beyond ourcontrol.           Toa certain degree we depend on our ability to sell or securitize first andsecond mortgage loans and, in the past, home equity line of credit loans (whichwe refer to as HELOC). Those actions involve the sale of whole loans or ofbeneficial interests in loans. Although the market for loans traditionally hasbeen substantial, if it experiences disruptions we may be unable to sell orsecuritize our mortgage or HELOC loans at favorable or profitable pricinglevels, or at all. If we are unable to continue to sell or securitize ourloans, we seek alternative funding sources to fund loan originations and meetour other liquidity needs. If we are unable to find cost-effective and stablealternatives, that failure can negatively impact our liquidity and canpotentially increase our cost of funds and lower our loan growth. Moreover,such disruptions: (i) can force us to significantly and disadvantageouslychange our loan products and product mix; (ii) can temporarily or indefinitelyreduce our loan origination flow and the resulting revenues; and, (iii) as toloans originated prior to such disruptions, can result in our selling suchloans at an immediate loss or our keeping them on our balance sheet or both.Keeping pre-disruption loans on our balance sheet can adversely impact ourliquidity and capital ratios, and can expose us to losses both immediately andlater due to the effects of accounting rules that require us to adjust certainloan values to the lower of cost or market (sometimes referred to as a LOCOMadjustment). Disruptions of this sort in 19fact occurredin 2007, as did many of the impacts outlined above; see Recent Downturns andDisruptions beginning on page 24 of this report for further information.           Eventsaffecting interest rates, markets, and other factors which adversely impact ourability or desire to access the capital markets for funding likewise mayadversely affect the demand for our services in our capital markets business. Asa result, disruptions in those areas may adversely impact our earnings in thatbusiness unit as well as in our retail/commercial banking and mortgage bankingunits. For instance, the disruptions in 2007 that were primarily related tomortgages and mortgage-backed assets significantly reduced the current demandfor certain of our capital markets products and services, and increased thecosts and uncertainties associated with our mortgage servicing business.          Whenwe sell or securitize mortgage and HELOC loans, we sometimes do with varyingdegrees of recourse, which means, in effect, that we retain some of the riskfor the loan if it defaults. In many instances we sell or securitize loans withno recourse. A loan sold with recourse generally means we retain substantial orfull responsibility if it defaults. For a loan sold with no recourse, we couldstill bear responsibility to the buyer in many cases if the loan defaults earlyor is paid off early (typically within the first 90 days), or if the loan doesnot conform to representations we made to the buyer at the time of sale. Inthose cases usually we would satisfy our obligations to the buyer by repurchaseor substitution of an eligible loan. Typically we have similar obligations forbreach of representations or warranties, or early default, if the loan isincluded on a non-recourse basis in a securitization transaction. We manage theearly default risk through our credit review processes, and we manage the riskof non-conformity through origination and documentation controls andprocedures, and through post-closing quality control processes. Additionalinformation concerning these risks is set forth under the caption ForeclosureReserves beginning on page 47 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis ofResults of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Reportto Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has beenincorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.          Ratingagencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role,agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. TheCorporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entitiesfor unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reducesavailability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating ofBaa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard& Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for manypurposes. At the present time, all three rating agencies rate the unsecuredsenior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade. Because wedepend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding andcapital, we could experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of funding ifour debt ratings were lowered, particularly if lowered below investment grade.In addition, other actions by ratings agencies can create uncertainty about ourratings in the future and thus can adversely affect the cost and availabilityof funding, including placing us on negative outlook or on watchlist. Pleasenote that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or holdsecurities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should beevaluated independently of any other rating.           Regulatorylaws or rules that establish minimum capital levels, regulate depositinsurance, and govern related funding matters for banks could be changed in amanner that could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce ourearnings. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks           Asignificant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money.Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues andexpenses, and potentially could expand or compress our net interest margin. Weactively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in netinterest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additionalinformation concerning 20those risksand our management of them appears under the caption Interest Rate RiskManagement beginning on page 28 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           Ourmortgage lending and servicing businesses also are affected by changes ininterest rates. Generally, when rates increase, demand for mortgage loans andHELOC tend to decrease (and our revenues from new originations tend to fall),and when rates decrease, demand tends to increases (and our originationrevenues tend to increase). In a contrary fashion, when interest ratesincrease, the value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) that we retain generallyincreases, and when rates decline the value of MSR tends to declines. However,those general tendencies do not result in concrete outcomes in allcircumstances; for example, a decrease in interest rates does not always resultin an increased volume of loan originations even if MSR values are affectednegatively because other factors may blunt loan demand or curtail creditavailability. Additional information concerning those risks and our managementof them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights and Other RelatedRetained Interests beginning on page 43 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Reportthat has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           Ourmortgage lending business is affected by changes in interest rates in anothermanner. During the period of loan origination (when loans are in the pipeline)and prior to the loans sale in the secondary market (when loans are in the warehouse),we are exposed to the risk of interest rate changes for those pipeline loanswhich we have agreed to lock in the customers mortgage rate and for allwarehouse loans that bear a fixed rate. We manage that rate-change risk throughhedging activities and other methods; however, it is not possible to eliminateall such risks, and a rate change is just one of the risks that could impactthe demand for, and thus the value of, our pipeline and warehouse loans.Additional information concerning those risks and our management of themappears under the caption Pipeline and Warehouse beginning on page 46 of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part ofthe material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item7 of Part II of this report.           Likeall financial services companies, we face the risks associated with movementsin the yield curve. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicableto short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are muchlower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are equal, ornearly equal, to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term ratesexceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is positivelysloped. However, recently the yield curve has been relatively flat or invertedfor protracted periods. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease netinterest margin, as yields on the warehouse narrow relative to their short-termfunding sources, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities,adversely impacting the revenues of our capital markets business. A prolongedinversion of the yield curve historically is so uncommon that it is difficultto predict all the effects that such a market condition is reasonably likely tocreate. One such effect upon us was an overall increase in the cost of hedgingmortgage servicing rights (MSR) in our mortgage business. This cost is tied tofactors including volatility in the market place, the shape of the yield curve,product duration, risk tolerance and other effects which may favorably orunfavorably impact hedging cost.           Lastly,expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest ratemovements, particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-termdebt which in turn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business.That risk is most apparent during times when strong 21expectationshave not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations areespecially weak or uncertain. SecuritiesInventories and Market Risks           Ourcapital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for itsinstitutional customers. In the course of that business we hold inventorypositions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition,we are exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debtsecurities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities throughcertain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related tocertain interest rate risks. Additional information concerning those risks andour management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginningon page 34 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operationsand Financial Condition section of our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders,which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated byreference into Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in the Credit Risksdiscussion beginning on page 17 of this report.           Inaddition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business andour management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitouschanges in markets or market prices can adversely affect those revenue sources.Venture Capital Risks           Ourventure capital business is inherently volatile. The companies we invest intend to be much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typicalpublic company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantial risk ofloss. Venture capital investments also are inherently illiquid. Success in thisbusiness can only be assessed in the long term and depends to a very large extentupon the ability of management to find sound investment prospects, negotiatefinancially appropriate investment terms, and oversee each investment as thecompany uses the venture capital and develops. In the short term, venturecapital losses are not uncommon even if the business proves to be successful inthe long term. Regulatory and Legal Risks           Weoperate in a heavily regulated industry and therefore are subject to manybanking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage, securities brokerage and underwriting,and consumer lending regulations in addition to the rules applicable to allcompanies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, onthe New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulationscould result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. In addition,efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/orlimit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervisionand Regulation in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 3 above, foradditional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal andstate regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as afinancial institution, may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide arrayof other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business,such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and statelegislative and regulatory authorities occasionally consider changing these regulationsor adopting new ones. Such actions could limit the amount of interest or feeswe can charge, could restrict our ability to collect loans or realize oncollateral, or could materially affect us in other ways. Additional federal andstate consumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protectionsafforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our ability toshare or receive customer information and increasing our costs. In addition,changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and reportassets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings.           The    Bank is required to maintain certain regulatory capital levels and ratios,    as discussed  under the caption Capital Adequacy beginning on page 6 of    this report. If the Bank experiences financial  losses, its ability to meet    those requirements may be strained. Pressure to maintain capital and capital     ratios during times of financial loss, especially protracted loss, may lead    to actions that are adverse to  our shareholders. Those actions could include,    among other things, reductions in our common dividend, the  sale of the Banks    or our stock at a time when market prices are disadvantageous, and a contraction    of our balance  sheet (involving sales or other dispositions of assets or    businesses) at a time when market values are depressed.22          Somestate authorities have from time to time challenged the position of the OCCthat it is the exclusive regulator of various aspects of national banks or theiroperating subsidiaries. If one or more of those challenges were successful, orif Congress or the OCC were to change the applicable banking laws orregulations, we could be impacted significantly, due, among other things, topossible increased regulatory burdens, governmental and private party actionsalleging non-compliance with state law, and the expense of tracking andcomplying with the different laws and regulations of nearly all 50 states.           Wealso face litigation risks from customers, employees, vendors, contractualparties, and other persons, either singly or in class actions, and from federalor state regulators. Litigation is an unavoidable part of doing business, andwe seek to manage those risks through internal controls, personnel training,insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, andother means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigationcannot be predicted or controlled with certainty. Holding Company Dividends          Historically    the Corporation has  depended upon common dividends from the Bank  for cash to fund common dividends paid to the Corporation’s shareholders.  Because the Bank experienced a loss for 2007, however, regulatory constraints  will prevent the Bank from declaring and paying dividends to the Corporation  in 2008 unless and until the Bank’s earnings are greater than $74.0 million  plus preferred dividends. The Bank has regulatory permission to declare preferred  dividends payable in April 2008, which are estimated to total approximately  $4 million. Additional information concerning those regulatory restrictions  on the Bank is discussed in more detail under the heading “Liquidity  Management” in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis section  beginning on page 30 of the Corporation’s 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders,  which section is incorporated herein by reference. At December 31, 2007 the  Corporation, on a non-consolidated basis, had approximately $215.9 million  cash on hand. The Corporation paid a dividend of 45 cents per share, or approximately  $56.5 million, in early January, 2008 and has declared a dividend of 20 cents  per share, or approximately $25.1 million, payable in April, 2008, representing  a rate reduction of over 50%. Due to the foregoing circumstances and certain  other commitments of the Corporation, the Corporation’s common dividend  could be at risk of further reduction unless the Bank’s earnings easethe regulatory constraints.Accounting Estimate Risks           Thepreparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with USgenerally accepted accounting principles requires management to makesignificant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of our mostcritical estimates are the level of the allowance for credit losses and thevaluation of mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionallybecome highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigationand other loss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points intime; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to theinherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in thefuture, we may significantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustaincredit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or wemay recognize a significant provision for impairment of our mortgage servicingrights, goodwill, or other assets, or we may make some other adjustment thatwill differ materially from the estimates that we make today. For additionalinformation concerning the sensitivity of these estimates, refer to CriticalAccounting Policies beginning on page 42 of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2007Annual Report to Shareholders. Risks of Expense Control           Expensesand other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfullymanage expenses is important to our long-term survival. Many factors caninfluence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As ourbusinesses change or expand, additional expenses can arise from assetpurchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, andchanging regulations, among other things. We manage expense growth and riskthrough a variety of means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcingvarious functions and procurement coordination and processes. Geographic Risks           Ourmortgage and capital markets businesses are national in scope, and capitalmarkets is developing in selected international markets. Our traditionalbanking business remains grounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennesseemarkets. As a result, to a greater degree than many of our competitors that operatenationally or in much broader regions, our banking business currently isexposed to adverse economic, regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks thatmight primarily impact Tennessee and the mid-South region of the US. 23Non-US Operations Risks           In2007 we expanded our capital markets business by opening an office in HongKong, our first office outside of the United States. Opening and operatingnon-US offices creates a number of risks. Specific risks associated with anynon-US presence include: the risk that taxes, licenses, fees, prohibitions, andother barriers and constraints may be created or increased by the US or othercountries that would impact our ability to operate overseas profitably or atall; the risk that our assets and operations in a particular country could benationalized in whole or part without adequate compensation; the risk thatcurrency exchange rates could move unfavorably so as to diminish or destroy theUS dollar value of assets, or to enlarge the US dollar value of liabilities,denominated in those currencies; and the risk that political or culturalpreferences in a particular host country might become antagonistic to UScompanies. Our ability to manage those and other risks will depend upon anumber of factors, including: our ability to recognize and anticipatedifferences in cultural and other expectations applicable to customers,employees, regulators, and vendors and other business partners; our ability torecognize and act upon opportunities and constraints peculiar to the countriesand cultures in which our offices operate; our ability to recognize and manageany exchange rate risks to which we are exposed; and our ability to anticipatethe stability of or changes in the political, legal, and monetary systems of thecountries in which our offices operate. Recent Downturns and Disruptions           In2007 several downturns and disruptions occurred in markets which are importantto our businesses, and similar or additional adverse events may occur in thefuture. Although those events did not create new types of risks, we believe itis useful to highlight some of the key impacts of those events on our businessto illustrate how events beyond our control can adversely affect us.           Someof the significant recent downturns and disruptions relevant to mortgage andrelated businesses include:     residential  housing values in the US have stagnated or fallen, and in some  highly-populated markets values have fallen significantly;    the volume  of residential housing transactions also has stagnated or fallen, and in some  markets volume has fallen significantly;    investor  demand for mortgage-backed securities fluctuated suddenly and sharply, and  for some categories of mortgages disappeared almost entirely;    except for conforming  loans, which are loan products conforming to standards of certain government  sponsored entities, rates for some types of home mortgage products have risen  sharply and some mortgage products, with new and more restrictive credit  criteria, have become difficult for borrowers to obtain even at high interest  rates, making it difficult or impossible for some borrowers to refinance an  existing mortgage;     many  mortgage borrowers in recent years have obtained adjustable-rate products,  and it is possible that many will adjust to higher rates, and therefore higher  payments, in the near future;    fear has  been expressed by some public officials and others that mortgage-related  defaults, foreclosures, and personal bankruptcies have risen and will rise  significantly in the future;    the US  Congress and other governmental bodies have considered, and in the future may  enact or adopt, new laws and regulations intended to modify the terms of  outstanding mortgage loans in a manner benefiting borrowers at the expense of  lenders, restrict the ability of lenders to make new loans, and increase the  regulatory burdens and legal risks on mortgage lenders and servicers; and24    the Federal  Reserve has acted recently to lower certain short-term interest rates,  possibly to help ameliorate the impacts of the disruptions in housing and the  mortgage industry, which has triggered reductions in the prime lending rates  charged by most US banks.           Someof the significant actual and potential impacts of those events on one or moreof our businesses include:     abrupt loss  in value of loans held in our pipeline and warehouse at times when investor  demand decreased sharply  the loans were priced appropriately when we made  our loan commitments but those prices were below market levels by the time  the loans could be sold to investors;    pressures on  our liquidity in the mortgage business as investor demand shrank and the  securitization markets diminished or, for some products, disappeared;     significant  reduction in our ability to create gains on sale of mortgage loans we  originate;     significant  reduction in mortgage origination volume and fees;    significant  reduction in the volume of and the fees from certain capital markets  structured finance activities;     significant  increase in delinquencies in some loan products and markets which are related  to mortgages and housing;     significant  increase in loan loss provision for loans secured by, or directly related to,  mortgages and the housing industry,     significant  volatility in our mortgage servicing rights (MSR) assets and mortgage  servicing business, with correspondingly volatile impacts on our earnings  from quarter to quarter;     significant  increase in costs of servicing mortgages due to increased credit remediation  and loss mitigation activity, as well as increased collection and foreclosure  activity;      the possibility that fallingUS prime rates in 2008 could compress our net interest margin; and    the  possibility that, in 2008, adjustable rate HELOC loans that are tied to  falling US prime rates could be drawn more fully and could be pre-paid less  often so that, in conjunction with falling housing values, the ratio of HELOC  loan balances to current actual values may weaken which could, in turn,  translate into higher loan losses and higher provisioning for future losses  within the HELOC portfolio"
6,FHN,FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP,2007-02-28,"ITEM 1A RISK FACTORS          This item outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businesses to compete, change our risk profile, or eventually impact our financial results. The risks we face generally are similar to thoseexperienced, to varying degrees, by all financial services companies.           Our strategies and managements ability to react to changing competitive and economic environments have enabled us historically to compete effectively and manage risks to acceptable levels. However, our operatingenvironment continues to evolve and new risks continue to emerge. To address that challenge we have established an enterprise-wide risk management committee that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks and oversees various initiativesdesigned to manage and control our potential exposure.           We have outlined potential risk factors below that we presently believe could be important to us; however, other risks may prove to be important in the future. New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict withcertainty all potential developments which could affect our financial performance. The following discussion highlights potential risks which could intensify over time or shift dynamically in a way that might change our risk profile. In addition tothe factors discussed elsewhere in this report (including the material incorporated into this report), among the factors that could cause our future results to differ materially from our past results and from expectations are those discussed in thisitem. Forward-Looking Statements          This report, including materials incorporated into it, may contain forward-looking statements with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, and estimates. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not arepresentation of historical information but rather are related to future operations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The words believe, expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely, will, goingforward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identify forward-looking statements.          Forward-looking statements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that are inherently subject to significant business, operational, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which arebeyond any company's control, and many of which, with respect to 14future business decisions and actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change. Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other important factors: general and local economic andbusiness conditions; expectations of and actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope of the yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial services institution; market and monetary fluctuations;inflation or deflation; investor responses to these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and other counterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry; geopolitical developments including possible terroristactivity; natural disasters; effectiveness of our hedging practices; technology; demand for our product offerings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; and critical accounting estimates.          Other factors are those inherent in originating and servicing loans including prepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing prices, fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles.Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers, Inc. and its affiliates, and other regulators; regulatory, administrative, and judicial proceedings and changes in laws and regulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plans andstrategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could cause actual results to differ. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements that are made in this report or in any other statement, release, report, or filingfrom time to time. Actual results could differ because of one or more factors, including those presented below, in other sections of this report, or in material incorporated by reference into this report. Readers of this report should carefullyconsider the factors discussed in this Item below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements and assessing our prospects. Competition Risks          Like all financial services companies, we compete for customers. Our primary areas of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealth management, home mortgage loans and lines of credit, mortgageservicing, capital markets products and services, and other consumer and business financial products and services. Our competitors in these areas include national, state, and non-US banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumerfinance companies, trust companies, investment counseling firms, money market and other mutual funds, insurance companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, and other financial services companies that serve the markets whichwe serve. We expect that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of our products and services. For additional information regarding competition for customers, refer to theCompetition heading of Part I, Item 1 beginning on page 11 of this report.          While we face competition for customers, we also compete for financial capital (see Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 18of this report) and to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive. Labor markets change over time; the segments of that market most useful to us may contract with demographic shifts relating to age, birth rates, education levels,geography, local or regional economic conditions, and other factors. Some of the keys to our ability to manage our competitive challenges are: Our leading position in many of our markets and business linesOur historical growth and retention of consumer and business customersHistorically strong employee value and loyalty ratings and national workplace recognition resulting in attraction and retention of high performing employees          Using those factors and others, we have focused on the delivery of products and services in a manner that maximizes the value our customers obtain from their relationships with us, and we have developed 15strategies that have enabled us to gain market share in our targeted markets over time. We also have developed strategies to attract customers and talent that are displaced when competitors merge.Growth Risks          Every organization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth in recent years has resulted primarily from a combination of: our national expansion strategy in banking; acquisition of customers from competitors thathave merged with each other; and targeted non-bank business acquisitions.           Our national expansion strategy is primarily organic. Our strategy is to expand our banking business in selected national markets by building on our mortgage customer relationships in those markets. Our strategy is unusualin the financial services industry; many banks elect to become national in scope by acquiring large local and regional banks in targeted geographic areas. We believe our national expansion strategy should reduce some of the costs and risksassociated with the acquisition model. The successful execution of our strategy depends upon a number of key elements, including: our ability to successfully penetrate new markets at a reasonable cost and within a reasonable time frame;our ability to cross-sell our home mortgage customers into bank products and services;our ability to attract and retain commercial and other non-mortgage customers;our ability to develop profitable customer relationships while expanding our existing information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively and efficiently; andour ability to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with such growth.We have in place a number of strategies designed to achieve each of those elements. Our challenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them as conditions change.           To the extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face various risks associated with that practice, including: our ability to identify, analyze, and correctly assess the contingent risks in the acquisition and to price the transaction appropriately;our ability to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and cost-effectively;our ability to integrate the name recognition and goodwill of the acquired company with our own; and,our ability to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company.          To grow effectively, sometimes a company must consider disposing of businesses or units that no longer fit into managements plans for the future. Key risks associated with dispositions include: our ability to price the transaction appropriately and otherwise negotiate appropriate terms;our ability to identify and implement key customer and other transition actions to avoid or minimize negative effects on retained businesses; andour ability to assess and manage any loss of synergies that the disposed business had with our retained businesses.Credit Risks          Like all other lenders, we face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss. In our business some level of credit loss16is unavoidable and overall levels of credit loss can vary over time. In 2006, for example, indicators of credit strength for us began the year at unusually strong levels but moderated throughout the year, roughlyparalleling a similar trend in the financial services industry. Our ability to manage credit risks depends primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and the value of collateral, including real estate. We control creditrisk by diversifying our loan portfolio and managing its granularity, and by recording and managing an allowance for expected loan losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable accounting rules. We also record loancharge-offs in accordance with accounting and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules could change and cause charge-offs to increase for reasons related or unrelated to the underlying performance of our portfolio; such changes bythe OCC and other banking agencies have been common in recent years. This risk is shared with all financial institutions. The models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans are regularly updated to take into account changes in thecompetitive environment, in real estate prices and other collateral values, and in the economy, among other things, based on our experience originating loans and servicing loan portfolios. Additional information concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions Credit Risk Management beginning on page 29, Foreclosure Reserves beginningon page 43, and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on page 44, of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Risk From Economic Downturns and Changes          Delinquencies and credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to an increase in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure on collateral values. Likewise, demand for loans (at a given levelof creditworthiness), deposit products, fixed income products, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn, and may be adversely affected by other national, regional, or local economic factors that impact demand for loans andother financial products and services such as (for example) changes in interest rates, real estate prices, or expectations concerning rates or prices. Accordingly, an economic downturn or other adverse economic change (local, regional, or national)can hurt our financial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan production levels, lower deposit levels, and lower fees from transactions and services. These risks are faced by all financial services companies and we have in placeprocesses and tools that we believe allow us to monitor and manage those risks. Hedge Risks          In the normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking, mortgage, and capital markets, we attempt to create partial or full economic hedges of various financial risks. We do that primarily by usingderivative instruments or by engaging in business activities that are countercyclical to the risks at issue. Our hedging activities are discussed in more detail in various places under the following captions of the Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning on page 23; and, Critical Accounting Policies, beginningon page 38. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which is a type of creditrisk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Although we actively manage those risks, unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant adverse effect on ourliquidity and earnings. 17Reputation Risks          Our ability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers, is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and our financial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a keyasset for us. Our reputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practices are perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adverselyimpact our reputation. In addition, adverse perceptions relating to parties with whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation.           Damage to our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets, could hamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, could create or aggravate regulatory difficulties, and couldundermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among other things. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws orregulations that change or constrain our business or operations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase our litigation risk.           As with all other risks, we actively devote significant resources to safeguard our reputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation risk monitoring, assessment, and management. Operational Risks          Our ability to grow is dependent in part upon our ability to create and maintain an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses as we expand, and recruit and retain personnel with the abilityto manage an increasingly complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including: errors related to failed or inadequate processes; faulty or disabled computer systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data andrelated security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties; and exposure to other external events.           In addition, we outsource some of our operational functions to third parties. Those third parties may experience similar errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have limited control and,in some cases, limited ability to quickly obtain an alternate vendor. To the extent we increase our reliance on third party vendors to perform or assist operational functions, the challenge of managing the associated risks becomes more difficult.          Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure, or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers,legal actions, or noncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk is specifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessment by line management and oversight of processes by top management;regulatory guidance for mitigating operational risk is followed. Additional information concerning operational risks and our management of them appears under the caption Operational Risk Managementbeginning on page 29 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is partof the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks          Management of liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additional information concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the caption Liquidity Management beginning on page 25 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and 18Financial Condition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           Our funding requirements currently are met principally by deposits, financing from other financial institutions, and financing using the capital markets. In general, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs ofdoing business and, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results.          A number of factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, or unavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financial results, organizational changes, adverse impacts on ourreputation, changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry, counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or otherassets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and the legal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our funding transactions. Inaddition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected by the general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets, and may become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors.          We depend significantly on our ability to sell or securitize first and second mortgage loans and home equity line of credit loans (which we refer to as HELOC). Those actions involve the sale of whole loans or of beneficialinterests in loans. Although the market for loans is substantial, if it experiences difficulties we may be unable to sell or securitize our mortgage or HELOC loans at favorable pricing levels, or at all. If we were unable to continue to sell orsecuritize our loans at current levels, we would seek alternative funding sources to fund loan originations and meet our other liquidity needs. If we were unable to find cost-effective and stable alternatives, that failure could negatively impactour liquidity and could potentially increase our cost of funds and lower our loan growth.          When we sell or securitize mortgage and HELOC loans, we sometimes do so with limited or full recourse, which means, in effect, that we will take some or significant financial responsibility for the loan if it defaults.Additional information concerning these risks is set forth under the caption Foreclosure Reserves beginning on page 43 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis ofResults of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. In many instances, we sellor securitize loans with no recourse. However, if a loan sold with no recourse defaults, we could still bear responsibility to the buyer in many cases if the loan defaults shortly after the sale, typically in the first 90 days, or if the loan didnot conform to representations we made to the buyer at the time of sale. We manage the early default risk through our credit review processes, and we manage the risk of non-conformity through origination and documentation controls and procedures,and through post-closing quality control processes.           Rating agencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role, agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. The Corporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several ratingentities for unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reduces availability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating of Baa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard &Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for many purposes. Currently, all three rating agencies rate the unsecured senior debt of the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade; however, during 2006 all three agencies changedtheir view of our outlook from stable to negative even though their ratings did not change. Because we depend on institutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, we could experience reduced liquidityand increased cost of funding if our debt ratings were lowered, particularly if lowered below investment grade. Please note that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold 19securities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should be evaluated independently of any other rating.           Regulatory laws or rules that establish minimum capital levels, regulate deposit insurance, and govern related funding matters for banks could be changed in a manner that could increase our overall cost of capital and thusreduce our earnings. Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks          A significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly, changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and potentially could compress our net interest margin. Weactively manage our balance sheet to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the captionInterest Rate Risk Management beginning on page 23 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and FinancialCondition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           Our mortgage lending and servicing businesses also are affected by changes in interest rates. Generally, when rates increase, demand for mortgage loans and HELOC decrease (and our revenues from new originations fall), andwhen rates decrease, demand increases (and our origination revenues increase). In a contrary fashion, when interest rates increase, the value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) that we retain generally increases, and when rates decline the value ofMSR declines. Within our mortgage businesses, therefore, there is a partial natural hedge against ordinary interest rate changes. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption MortgageServicing Rights and Other Related Retained Interests beginning on page 39 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Conditionsection of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           Our mortgage lending business is affected by changes in interest rates in another manner. During the period of loan origination (when loans are in the pipeline) and prior to the loans sale in thesecondary market (when loans are in the warehouse), we are exposed to the risk of interest rate changes for those pipeline loans as to which we have agreed to lock in the customers mortgage rate and for all warehouse loans thatbear a fixed rate. We manage that rate-change risk through hedging activities and other methods. Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Pipeline and Warehouse beginning on page 42 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the materialfrom that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.           Like all financial services companies, we face the risks of abnormalities in the yield curve. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable to short and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term ratesare much lower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are equal, or nearly equal, to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term rates exceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is relatively steep.However, during much of 2006 the yield curve was inverted and the degree of inversion generally worsened as the year progressed. A flat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, as the warehouse yields narrow relative to theirshort-term funding sources, and it tends to reduce demand for long-term debt securities, adversely impacting the revenues of our capital markets business. 20          Lastly, expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest rate movements, particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-term debt which in turn can impact the revenues of our capitalmarkets business. That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yet been reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak or uncertain. Securities Inventories and Market Risks          Our capital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for its customers. In the course of that business we hold inventory positions and are exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition, weare exposed to credit risk and interest rate risk associated with debt securities. We manage the risks of holding inventories of securities through certain policies and procedures, including hedging activities related to certain interest rate risks.Additional information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under the caption Market Risk Management beginning on page 29 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by referenceinto Item 7 of Part II of this report, and in the Credit Risks discussion beginning on page 16 of this report.           In addition, we earn fees and other income related to our brokerage business and our management of assets for customers. Declines, disruptions, or precipitous changes in market prices can adversely affect those revenuesources. Venture Capital Risks          Our venture capital business is inherently volatile. The companies we invest in tend to be much less mature, smaller, and much more unproven than a typical public company. Accordingly, those investments carry a substantialrisk of loss. Venture capital investments also are inherently illiquid. Success in this business can only be assessed in the long term and depends to a very large extent upon the ability of management to find sound investment prospects, negotiatefinancially appropriate investment terms, and oversee each investment as the company uses the venture capital and develops. In the short term, venture capital losses are not uncommon even if the business proves to be successful in the long term.Regulatory and Legal Risks          We operate in a heavily regulated industry and therefore are subject to many banking, deposit, insurance, insurance brokerage, securities brokerage and underwriting, and consumer lending regulations in addition to therules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities markets and, in particular, on the New York Stock Exchange. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial, structural, and operational penalties. Inaddition, efforts to comply with applicable regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1 of this report, beginning on page 3 above, for additional information concerning financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution,may engage. In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatoryauthorities occasionally consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such actions could limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could restrict our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, or could materiallyaffect us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial institutions, restricting our 21ability to share or receive customer information and increasing our costs. In addition, changes in accounting rules can significantly affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and earnings.          Some state authorities have challenged the position of the OCC that it is the exclusive regulator of various aspects of national banks or  their operating subsidiaries. If one or more of those challenges are successfulor if Congress were to change the applicable banking laws, we could be impacted significantly,  due, among other things, to possible increased regulatory burdens, governmental and private party actions alleging non-compliance with state law, and   the expense of tracking and complying with thedifferent laws and regulations of nearly all 50 states.           We also face litigation risks from customers (singly or in class actions) and from federal or state regulators. Litigation is an unavoidable part of doing business, and we manage those risks through internal controls,personnel training, insurance, litigation management, our compliance and ethics processes, and other means. However, the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted or controlled with certainty. Accounting Estimate Risks          The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Two of ourmost critical estimates are the level of the allowance for credit losses and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights. However, other estimates occasionally become highly significant, especially in volatile situations such as litigation and otherloss contingency matters. Estimates are made at specific points in time; as actual events unfold, estimates are adjusted accordingly. Due to the inherent nature of these estimates, it is possible that, at some time in the future, we maysignificantly increase the allowance for credit losses and/or sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the provided allowance, or we may recognize a significant provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights, or we maymake some other adjustment that will differ materially from the estimates that we make today. For additional information concerning the sensitivity of these estimates, refer to Critical Accounting Policies  beginning on page 38  of theManagements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders. Risks of Expense Control          Expenses and other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfully manage expenses is important to our long-term survival. Many factors can influence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly theygrow. As our businesses change or expand, additional expenses can arise from asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolving business strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. We manage expense growth and risk through a varietyof means, including selectively outsourcing or multi-sourcing various functions and procurement coordination and processes.Geographic Risks          Our mortgage and capital markets businesses are national in scope. Our national expansion strategy is making our banking business national as well, with full-service branches in several states and many banking productsbeing sold through mortgage offices across the U.S. At present, however, a disproportionate fraction of our traditional banking business remains grounded in, and depends upon, the major Tennessee markets. As a result, to a greater degree than manyof our competitors that operate nationally or in much broader regions, our banking business currently is exposed to adverse economic, 22regulatory, natural disaster, and other risks that might primarily impact Tennessee and the mid-South region of the U.S"
13,FHN,FIRST HORIZON NATIONAL CORP,2006-03-08,"ITEM 1ARISK FACTORS          Thisitem outlines specific risks that could affect the ability of our various businessesto compete, change our risk profile, or eventually impact our financial results.The risks we face generally are similar to those experienced, to varyingdegrees, by all financial services companies.          Our  strategies and managements ability to react to changing competitive and  economic environments have enabled us historically to compete effectively, manage  risks to acceptable levels, and create industry leading profitability levels.  However, our operating environment continues to evolve and new risks continue  to emerge. To address that challenge we have established an enterprise-wide  risk management committee that oversees processes for monitoring evolving risks  and oversees various initiatives designed to manage and control our potential  exposure.          Wehave outlined potential risk factors below that we presently believe could beimportant to us; however, other risks may prove to be important in the future.New risks may emerge at any time and we cannot predict with certainty allpotential developments which could affect our financial performance. Thefollowing discussion highlights potential risks which could intensify over timeor shift dynamically in a way that might change our risk profile. In additionto the factors discussed elsewhere in this report (including the materialincorporated into this report), among the factors that could cause our futureresults to differ materially from our past results and from expectations are thosediscussed in this item.Forward-Looking Statements           Thisreport, including materials incorporated into it, may contain forward-lookingstatements with respect to our beliefs, plans, goals, expectations, andestimates. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not arepresentation of historical information but rather are related to futureoperations, strategies, financial results or other developments. The words believe,expect, anticipate, intend, estimate, should, is likely,will, goingforward, and other expressions that indicate future events and trends identifyforward-looking statements.           Forward-lookingstatements are necessarily based upon estimates and assumptions that areinherently subject to significant business, operational, economic andcompetitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond anycompanys control, and many of which, with respect to future business decisionsand actions (including acquisitions and divestitures), are subject to change.Examples of uncertainties and contingencies include, among other importantfactors: general and local economic and business conditions; expectations ofand actual timing and amount of interest rate movements, including the slope ofthe yield curve, which can have a significant impact on a financial servicesinstitution; market and monetary fluctuations; inflation or deflation; investorresponses to these conditions; the financial condition of borrowers and othercounterparties; competition within and outside the financial services industry;geopolitical developments including possible terrorist activity; naturaldisasters; effectiveness of our hedging practices; technology; demand for our productofferings; new products and services in the industries in which we operate; andcritical accounting estimates. 14          Otherfactors are those inherent in originating and servicing loans includingprepayment risks, pricing concessions, fluctuation in U.S. housing prices,fluctuation of collateral values, and changes in customer profiles.Additionally, the actions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), theFinancial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the Office of the Comptroller ofthe Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, theNational Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. and its affiliates, and otherregulators; regulatory and judicial proceedings and changes in laws andregulations applicable to us; and our success in executing our business plansand strategies and managing the risks involved in the foregoing, could causeactual results to differ. We assume no obligation to update any forward-lookingstatements that are made in this report or in any other statement, release,report, or filing from time to time. Actual results could differ because ofseveral factors, including those presented below and in other sections of thisreport. Readers of this report should carefully consider the factors discussed inthis Item below, among others, in evaluating forward-looking statements andassessing our prospects.Competition Risks          Like  all financial services companies, we compete for customers. Our primary areas  of competition include: retail and commercial deposits and bank loans, wealth  management, home mortgage loans and lines of credit, mortgage servicing, capital  markets products and services, and other consumer and business financial products  and services. Our competitors in these areas include national and state banks,  savings and loan associations, credit unions, consumer finance companies, trust  companies, investment counseling firms, money market mutual funds, insurance  companies and agencies, securities firms, mortgage banking companies, and other  financial services companies that serve the markets which we serve. We expect  that competition will continue to grow more intense with respect to most of  our products and services. For additional information regarding competition  for customers, refer to the Competition heading of Part I, Item  1 beginning on page 11 of this report.           While  we face competition for customers, we also compete for financial capital (see  Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks beginning on page 18 of  this report) and to acquire and retain the human capital we need to thrive.  Some of the keys to our ability to manage our competitive challenges are:    Our leading position  in many of our markets and business lines    Our  historical growth and retention of consumer and business customer bases    Historically  strong employee value and loyalty ratings and national workplace recognition  resulting in attraction and retention of high performing employeesUsing thosefactors and others, we have focused on the delivery of products and services ina manner that maximizes the value our customers obtain from their relationshipswith us, and we have developed strategies that have enabled us to gain market sharein our targeted markets over time. We also have developed strategies to attractand retain customers and talent that are displaced when competitors merge. Growth Risks          Everyorganization faces risks associated with growth. Our growth in 2005 resulted primarilyfrom a combination of: our national expansion strategy in banking; acquisitionof customers from competitors that have merged with each other; and targetednon-bank business acquisitions.15          Ournational expansion strategy is primarily organic. Our strategy is to expand ourbanking business in selected national markets by building on our mortgage customerrelationships in those markets. Our strategy is unusual in the financial servicesindustry; many banks elect to become national in scope by acquiring large localand regional banks in targeted geographic areas. We believe our nationalexpansion strategy should reduce some of the costs and risks associated withthe acquisition model. The successful execution of our strategy depends upon anumber of key elements, including:    our ability  to successfully penetrate new markets at a reasonable cost and within a  reasonable time frame;    our ability  to cross-sell our home mortgage customers into bank products and services;    our ability  to attract and retain commercial and other non-mortgage customers;     our ability  to develop profitable customer relationships while expanding our existing  information processing, technology, and other operational infrastructures effectively  and efficiently; and     our ability  to manage the liquidity and capital requirements associated with such growth.We have inplace a number of strategies designed to achieve each of those elements. Ourchallenge is to execute those strategies and adjust them as conditions change.          Tothe extent we engage in bank or non-bank business acquisitions, we face variousrisks associated with that practice, including:    our ability  to integrate the acquired company into our operations quickly and  cost-effectively;     our ability  to integrate the name recognition and goodwill of the acquired company with  our own; and,    our ability  to retain customers and key employees of the acquired company.Credit Risks          Like  all other lenders, we face the risk that our customers may not repay their loans  and that the realizable value of collateral may be insufficient to avoid a loss.  In our business some level of credit loss is unavoidable and overall levels  of credit loss can vary over time. Our ability to manage credit risks depends  primarily upon our ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and the  value of collateral, including real estate. We control credit risk by diversifying  our loan portfolio and by recording and managing an allowance for expected loan  losses based on the factors mentioned above and in accordance with applicable  accounting rules. We also record loan charge-offs in accordance with accounting  and regulatory guidelines and rules. These guidelines and rules could change  and cause charge-offs to increase for reasons related or unrelated to the underlying  performance of our portfolio; this risk is shared with all financial institutions.  The models and approaches we use to originate and manage loans are continually  updated to take into account changes in the competitive environment, in real  estate prices, and in the economy, among other things. Additional information  concerning credit risks and our management of them is set forth under the captions  Credit Risk Management beginning on page 29, Foreclosure Reserves  beginning on page 43, and Allowance for Loan Losses beginning on  page 44, of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations  and Financial Condition section of our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, which  is part of the 16material fromthat Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II ofthis report.Risk From Economic Downturns           Delinquenciesand credit losses generally increase during economic downturns due to anincrease in liquidity problems for customers and downward pressure oncollateral values. Likewise, demand for loans, deposit products, fixed incomeproducts, and financial services may decline during an economic downturn.Accordingly, an economic downturn (local, regional, or national) can hurt ourfinancial performance in the form of higher loan losses, lower loan levels,lower deposit levels, and lower fees from transactions and services. Theserisks are faced by all financial services companies and we have in placeprocesses and tools that we believe allow us to monitor and manage those risks.Hedge Risks          In  the normal course of our businesses, including (among others) banking, mortgage,  and capital markets, we attempt to partially or fully hedge various financial  risks. We do that primarily by using derivative instruments or by engaging in  business activities that are countercyclical to the risks at issue. Our hedging  activities are discussed in more detail in various places under the following  captions of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations  and Financial Condition section of our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, which  is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by reference  into Item 7 of Part II of this report: Risk Management, beginning  on page 23; and, Critical Accounting Policies, beginning on page  37. Hedging creates certain risks for us, including the risk that the other  party to the hedge transaction will fail to perform (counterparty risk, which  is a type of credit risk), and the risk that the hedge will not fully protect  us from loss as intended (hedge failure risk). Although we actively manage those  risks, unexpected counterparty failure or hedge failure could have a significant  adverse effect on our liquidity and earnings.Reputation Risks           Ourability to conduct and grow our businesses, and to obtain and retain customers,is highly dependent upon external perceptions of our business practices and ourfinancial stability. Our reputation is, therefore, a key asset for us. Ourreputation is affected principally by our own practices and how those practicesare perceived and understood by others. Adverse perceptions regarding thepractices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, also may adverselyimpact our reputation. In addition, adverse perceptions relating to partieswith whom we have important relationships may adversely impact our reputation.          Damageto our reputation could hinder our ability to access the capital markets, couldhamper our ability to attract new customers and retain existing ones, and couldundermine our ability to attract and retain talented employees, among otherthings. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry,may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which maylead to laws or regulations that change or constrain our business oroperations. Events that result in damage to our reputation also may increase ourlitigation risk.          Aswith all other risks, we actively devote significant resources to safeguard ourreputation. Senior management oversees processes for reputation riskmonitoring, assessment, and management.17Operational Risks           Our  ability to grow is dependent in part upon our ability to create and maintain  an appropriate operational and organizational infrastructure, manage expenses  as we expand, and recruit and retain personnel with the ability to manage an  increasingly complex business. Operational risk can arise in many ways, including:  errors related to failed or inadequate processes; faulty or disabled computer  systems; fraud, theft, physical security breaches, electronic data and related  security breaches, or other criminal conduct by employees or third parties;  and exposure to other external events. In addition, we outsource some of our  operational functions to third parties; those third parties may experience similar  errors or disruptions that could adversely impact us and over which we may have  limited control. Failure to build and maintain the necessary operational infrastructure,  or failure of our disaster preparedness plans if primary infrastructure components  suffer damage, can lead to risk of loss of service to customers, legal actions,  or noncompliance with applicable laws or regulatory standards. Operational risk  is specifically managed through internal monitoring, measurement, and assessment  by line management and oversight of processes by top management; regulatory  guidance for mitigating operational risk is followed. Additional information  concerning operational risks and our management of them appears under the caption  Operational Risk Management beginning on page 29 of the Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section  of our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from  that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of  this report.Financing, Funding, and Liquidity Risks          Management  of liquidity and related risks is a key function for our business. Additional  information concerning liquidity risk management is set forth under the caption  Liquidity Management beginning on page 25 of the Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section  of our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from  that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of  this report.          Ourfunding requirements currently are met principally by deposits, financing fromother financial institutions, and financing using the capital markets. Ingeneral, the costs of our funding directly impact our costs of doing businessand, therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financialresults.           Anumber of factors could make such funding more difficult, more expensive, orunavailable on affordable terms, including, but not limited to, our financialresults, organizational changes, adverse impacts on our reputation, changes inthe activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets,specific events that adversely impact the financial services industry,counterparty availability, changes affecting our loan portfolio or otherassets, changes affecting our corporate and regulatory structure, interest ratefluctuations, ratings agency actions, general economic conditions, and thelegal, regulatory, accounting, and tax environments governing our fundingtransactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds is strongly affected bythe general state of the U.S. and world economies and financial markets, andmay become increasingly difficult due to economic and other factors.           Wedepend significantly on our ability to sell or securitize first and second mortgageloans and home equity lines of credit (which we refer to as HELOC). Thoseactions involve the sale of whole loans or of beneficial interests in loans.Although the market for loans is substantial,18if itexperiences difficulties we may be unable to sell or securitize our mortgage orHELOC loans at all, or at favorable pricing levels. If we were unable tocontinue to sell or securitize our loans at current levels, we would seekalternative funding sources to fund loan originations and meet our otherliquidity needs. If we were unable to find cost-effective and stablealternatives, that failure could negatively impact our liquidity and couldpotentially increase our cost of funds and lower our loan growth.           When  we sell or securitize mortgage and HELOC loans, we sometimes do so with limited  or full recourse, which means, in effect, that we will take some or significant  financial responsibility for the loan if it defaults. Additional information  concerning these risks is set forth under the caption Foreclosure Reserves  beginning on page 43 of the Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results  of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders,  which is part of the material from that Report that has been incorporated by  reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report. In many instances, we sell  or securitize loans with no recourse. However, if a loan sold with no recourse  defaults, we could still bear responsibility to the buyer if the loan did not  conform to representations we made to the buyer at the time of sale. We manage  that risk of non-conformity through origination and documentation controls and  procedures.          Ratingagencies assign credit ratings to issuers and their debt. In that role,agencies directly affect the availability and cost of our funding. TheCorporation and the Bank currently receive ratings from several rating entitiesfor unsecured borrowings. A rating below investment grade typically reducesavailability and increases the cost of market-based funding. A debt rating ofBaa3 or higher by Moodys Investors Service, or BBB- or higher by Standard& Poors and Fitch Ratings, is considered investment grade for manypurposes. Currently, all three rating agencies rate the unsecured senior debtof the Corporation and the Bank as investment grade. Because we depend oninstitutional borrowing and the capital markets for funding and capital, wecould experience reduced liquidity and increased cost of funding if our debtratings were lowered, particularly if lowered below investment grade. Pleasenote that a credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell, or holdsecurities, is subject to revision or withdrawal at any time, and should beevaluated independently of any other rating.          Regulatorylaws or rules that establish minimum capital levels, regulate depositinsurance, and govern related funding matters for banks could be changed in amanner that could increase our overall cost of capital and thus reduce ourearnings.Interest Rate and Yield Curve Risks          A  significant portion of our business involves borrowing and lending money. Accordingly,  changes in interest rates directly impact our revenues and expenses, and potentially  could compress our net interest margin. We actively manage our balance sheet  to control the risks of a reduction in net interest margin brought about by  ordinary fluctuations in rates. Additional information concerning those risks  and our management of them appears under the caption Interest Rate Risk  Management beginning on page 23 of the Managements Discussion and  Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section of our 2005  Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from that Report  that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of this report.          Ourmortgage lending and servicing businesses also are affected by changes ininterest rates. Generally, when rates increase, demand for mortgage loans andHELOC decrease (and our revenues from new originations fall), and when ratesdecrease, demand increases (and our19origination revenues increase). In a contrary fashion, when interest  rates increase, the value of mortgage servicing rights (MSR) that we retain  increases, and when rates decline the value of MSR declines. Within our mortgage  businesses, therefore, there is a partial natural hedge against ordinary interest  rate changes. Additional information concerning those risks and our management  of them appears under the caption Mortgage Servicing Rights and Other  Related Retained Interests beginning on page 37 of the Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section  of our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from  that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of  this report.          Our  mortgage lending business is affected by changes in interest rates in another  manner. During the period of loan origination and prior to the loans sale  in the secondary market (when loans are in the pipeline and the  warehouse), we are exposed to the risk of interest rate changes  for those loans as to which we have agreed to lock in the customers mortgage  rate. We manage that risk through hedging activities and other methods. Additional  information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under  the caption Pipeline and Warehouse beginning on page 42 of the Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section  of our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from  that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of  this report.          Likeall financial services companies, we face the risks of abnormalities in theyield curve. The yield curve simply shows the interest rates applicable toshort and long term debt. The curve is steep when short-term rates are muchlower than long-term rates; it is flat when short-term rates are equal, ornearly equal, to long-term rates; and it is inverted when short-term ratesexceed long-term rates. Historically, the yield curve normally is relativelysteep. However, during most of 2005 the yield curve has been relatively flat. Aflat or inverted yield curve tends to decrease net interest margin, as thewarehouse yields narrow relative to their short-term funding sources, and ittends to reduce demand for long-term debt, adversely impacting the revenues ofour capital markets business.          Lastly,expectations by the market regarding the direction of future interest ratemovements, particularly long-term rates, can impact the demand for long-termdebt which in turn can impact the revenues of our capital markets business.That risk is most apparent during times when strong expectations have not yetbeen reflected in market rates, or when expectations are especially weak oruncertain.Securities Inventories Risks          Our  capital markets business buys and sells various types of securities for its  customers. In the course of that business we hold inventory positions and are  exposed to certain risks of market fluctuations. In addition, we are exposed  to credit risk associated with debt securities. We manage the risks of holding  inventories of securities through certain policies and procedures. Additional  information concerning those risks and our management of them appears under  the caption Market Risk Management beginning on page 29 of the Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section  of our 2005 Annual Report to Shareholders, which is part of the material from  that Report that has been incorporated by reference into Item 7 of Part II of  this report, and in the Credit Risks discussion beginning on page  16 of this report.20Regulatory and Legal Risks           We  operate in a heavily regulated industry and therefore are subject to many banking,  deposit, insurance, brokerage, and consumer lending regulations in addition  to the rules applicable to all companies publicly traded in the U.S. securities  markets. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in financial,  structural, and operational penalties. In addition, efforts to comply with applicable  regulations may increase our costs and/or limit our ability to pursue certain  business opportunities. See Supervision and Regulation in Item 1  of this report, beginning on page 3 above, for additional information concerning  financial industry regulations. Federal and state regulations significantly  limit the types of activities in which we, as a financial institution, may engage.  In addition, we are subject to a wide array of other regulations that govern  other aspects of how we conduct our business, such as in the areas of employment  and intellectual property. Federal and state legislative and regulatory authorities  occasionally consider changing these regulations or adopting new ones. Such  actions could limit the amount of interest or fees we can charge, could restrict  our ability to collect loans or realize on collateral, or could materially affect  us in other ways. Additional federal and state consumer protection regulations  also could expand the privacy protections afforded to customers of financial  institutions, restricting our ability to share or receive customer information  and increasing our costs. In addition, changes in accounting rules can significantly  affect how we record and report assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and  earnings.          Wealso face litigation risks from customers (singly or in class actions) and fromfederal or state regulators. Litigation is an unavoidable part of doingbusiness in our industry, and we manage those risks through internal controls,personnel training, insurance, litigation management, and other means. However,the commencement, outcome, and magnitude of litigation cannot be predicted orcontrolled with certainty.Risks of Expense Control           Expensesand other costs directly affect our earnings. Our ability to successfullymanage expenses is important to our long-term survival. Many factors caninfluence the amount of our expenses, as well as how quickly they grow. As ourbusinesses change or expand, additional expenses can arise from usingoutsourced services, asset purchases, structural reorganization, evolvingbusiness strategies, and changing regulations, among other things. Geographic Risks          Ourmortgage and capital markets businesses are national in scope. Our nationalexpansion strategy is making our banking business national as well. At present,however, a majority of our banking business is grounded in, and depends upon,the major Tennessee markets. As a result, to a greater degree than many of ourcompetitors that operate nationally or in much broader regions, our bankingbusiness currently is exposed to adverse economic, regulatory, naturaldisaster, and other risks that might primarily impact Tennessee and themid-South region of the U.S"
