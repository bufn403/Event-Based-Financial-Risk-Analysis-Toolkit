2,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2024-02-29,"Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are what management believes are the material risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company.8Table of Contents Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions Adverse changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings. Our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, public unrest, increases in energy costs, inflation, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including the COVID-19 pandemic, and federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including continuing military conflict between Israel and Hamas, Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events. There has been significant improvement in tourism and general economic conditions in Hawaii since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  However, in August 2023, wildfires broke out in West Maui destroying the historic town of Lahaina as well as structures and farmland in Upcountry Maui and North Kihei.  Roughly 2,200 structures were lost in the fire, 86% of which were homes.  Although hotels have reopened, Maui’s visitor industry will continue to be impacted in the coming years. Deterioration of economic conditions, locally, nationally, and internationally could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues, higher expenses, and lower earnings.  The level of domestic and international visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral. A prolonged period of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses.  Economic and inflationary pressure on consumers and uncertainty regarding the economic improvement could result in changes in consumer and commercial spending, borrowing and savings habits.  Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on the credit quality of our loans and our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change and the governmental responses to it could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its customers The impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and rising sea levels, could impact the Bank’s operations as well as those of its customers and third party vendors upon which it relies.  Such events could also result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay outstanding loans, or result in the deterioration of the value of our collateral causing a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial condition and results of operation. Furthermore, increasing regulation related to climate change could have an adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the Bank and its customers, including our credit portfolio. Further legislation and regulatory requirements could increase the operating expenses of, or otherwise adversely impact, the Bank or its customers.  To the extent that the Bank or its customers experience increases in costs, reductions in the value of assets, constraints on operations or similar concerns driven by changes in regulation relating to climate change, the Bank’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected. Disruptions, instability and failures in the banking industry. Recent events impacting the financial services industry, including the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, have resulted in decreased confidence in banks among consumer and commercial depositors, other counterparties and investors, as well as significant disruption, volatility and reduced valuations of equity and other securities of banks in the capital markets. These events occurred during a period of rapidly rising interest rates which, among other things, has resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and loans held by banks, more competition for bank deposits and may increase the risk of a potential recession. These recent events have, and could continue to, adversely impact the market price and volatility of the Company’s common stock. These recent events may also result in potentially adverse changes to laws or regulations governing banks and bank holding companies or result in the impositions of restrictions through supervisory or enforcement activities, including higher capital requirements, which could have a material impact on our business. Inability to access short-term funding, loss of client deposits or changes in our credit ratings could increase the cost of funding, limit access to capital markets or negatively impact our overall liquidity or capitalization. We may be impacted by concerns regarding the soundness or 9Table of Contents creditworthiness of other financial institutions, which can cause substantial and cascading disruption within the financial markets and increased expenses. Any reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads.  If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected. Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate. Increased credit losses for the Bank could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated expected credit losses over the life of the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolios in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses. Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may be required to take increased reserves and/or experience higher credit losses in future periods.  Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Consumer protection initiatives and court decisions related to the foreclosure process affect our remedies as a creditor. Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor. In addition, Hawaii’s appellate courts have made rulings that increase the complexity and risk of nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures. At the same time, a chronic backlog of cases in the Hawaii courts has slowed the judicial foreclosure process, which delays the Bank’s ability to take over, preserve, and sell the mortgaged property.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures and costs, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations. Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to 10Table of Contents liquidate investments or move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management, thereby decreasing our investment management revenues. The Parent’s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank. The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on the Parent’s common and preferred stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent’s share repurchase program.  Various federal and state laws and regulations impose limitations on the payment of dividends, such as requiring regulatory approval under certain circumstances.  Limitations on the Parent’s ability to receive dividends from the Bank could have a material adverse effect on the Parent’s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock.There can be no assurance that the Parent will repurchase stock or continue to declare cash dividends.During 2023, the Parent repurchased 150,000 shares of common stock at a total cost of $9.9 million under its share repurchase program.  However, we suspended share repurchases in April 2023 in response to the turmoil in the banking industry due to several significant bank failures.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $111.8 million on common shares during 2023.  In January 2024, the Parent’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share on the Parent’s outstanding common shares. Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.  Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory and supervisory restrictions, and various other factors. In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or prolonged suspension of stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. Risks Related to Regulatory Changes Fiscal and Monetary Policy changes may significantly impact our profitability and liquidity The Company’s business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government and its agencies.  The Bank is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States.  Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.  These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.  Changes to these policies of the Federal Reserve may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new interpretations, restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company’s business. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act, other consumer protection laws, and their implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs, along with possible restrictions on our products, services and manner of operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  Staff changes to key positions within the CFPB by the Biden administration may result in the CFPB pursuing more strict enforcement policies, similar to that experienced under the Obama administration. Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remains with the FRB.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products as a whole, the Company has become subject to more and 11Table of Contents expanded regulatory examinations, which also could result in increased costs as well as harm to our reputation in the event of a finding that we have not complied with the increased regulatory requirements. New laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be implemented, interpreted, repealed or reinstated, in the current regulatory and political climate, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability. In addition, there may be increased regulatory scrutiny in the course of routine examinations and otherwise, and new regulations designed to respond to recent negative developments in the banking industry, all of which may increase our costs of doing business and reduce our profitability.  Among other things, there may be increased focus by both regulators and investors on deposit composition, the level of uninsured deposits, brokered deposits, unrealized losses in securities portfolios, liquidity, commercial real estate composition and concentration, and capital and general oversight and control of the foregoing.  Financial institutions, such as ourselves, could face increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators and/or the investor community, which could negatively affect its results of operations and financial condition. Further, leadership and staff changes in regulatory agencies such as the CFPB, CFTC, SEC, and the Treasury Department could lead to changes in the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies.  The potential impact of any changes within these agencies cannot be predicted at this time. Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company. Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company. Compliance with Basel III resulted in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements. See the “Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry” section in MD&A for more information.Changes in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Further changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  For example, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022, and introduced, among provisions, a new corporate minimum income tax on certain large corporations, an excise tax of 1% on certain share repurchases by corporations, and increased funding for the Internal Revenue Service.  Although we do not anticipate the new corporate minimum income tax will currently apply to us, changes in our business and any future regulations or other guidance on the interpretation and application of the new corporate minimum tax, as well as the potential application of the share repurchase excise tax, may result in additional taxes payable by us, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results and operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Business Operations A failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation. We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  In addition, our communications and information systems and operations (including those of third parties that facilitate our business activities) could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures, and similar events or disruptions. 12Table of Contents  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.An interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, intelligence-gathering by foreign governments, or from accidental technological failure internally or by our vendors.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent emails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our customers’ devices.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving other companies’ losses of customer personal and financial information, we believe this risk could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs through the ongoing cost of technology investments to improve security, as well as the potential financial and reputational impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company.Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus making it virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial and personal information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation. 13Table of Contents Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility. Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.  Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.  For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans. These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income. Our mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change. We act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”) such as Fannie Mae.  As a seller and servicer for those loans, we make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements.  We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements.  We may be penalized and, in limited instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements.  Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs. Risks related to representation and warranty provisions may impact our mortgage loan servicing business The Company sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to Fannie Mae.  The Company also pools Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to Ginnie Mae.  These pools of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans are securitized by Ginnie Mae.  The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans.  Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover ownership of the loan, validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and other matters.  As of December 31, 2023, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold by the Company was $2.0 billion.  The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian. Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, the Company may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met.  Some agreements may require the Company to repurchase delinquent loans.  Upon receipt of a repurchase request, the Company works with investors or insurers to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution. Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor or insurer and to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred.  The Company manages the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through its underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards.  For the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company repurchased three residential mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance totaling $0.6 million as a result of the representation and warranty provisions contained in these contracts.  The loans were delinquent as to principal and interest at the time of repurchase, however, no material losses were incurred related to these repurchases. Risks relating to residential mortgage loan servicing activities may adversely affect our results. In addition to servicing loans in the Company’s portfolio, substantially all of the loans the Company sells to investors are sold with servicing rights retained.  The Company also services loans originated by other mortgage loan originators.  As servicer, the Company’s primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the documents governing a securitization, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales. Each agreement under which the Company acts as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements.  However, if the Company commits a material breach of obligations as servicer, the Company may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice.  The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor.  These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company.  Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan.14Table of Contents  The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results. We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, mark-to-market gains or losses may impact equity or income. The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Mark-to-market values of non-hedged available-for-sale investment securities are recorded in shareholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive income, while hedged investment securities are recorded in interest income.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to reserve for credit losses in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any credit allowance recognized will be measured as the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected over the security’s lifetime. Natural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations. Real estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.  The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii with its unique weather and geology.  Our business operations could suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to damage from weather or other natural disasters.  Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.  A natural disaster in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands could cause property values in the affected areas to fall, might limit our customers' access to adequate property insurance, or otherwise impact borrowers’ ability to pay their financial obligations, any of which would increase our exposure to loan defaults and could require the Bank to record an impairment on our financial statements. General Risk Factors
 Competition may adversely affect our business. Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial technology companies and financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies. Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs, and may benefit from tax exemptions or lower tax rates.  As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures. We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve. Both federal and local laws provide mechanisms for out-of-state banks and their holding companies to acquire or open branches in our service territories.  Failure to effectively address this competitive risk by competing, innovating and making effective use of new and existing channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity. Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal and/or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity. We are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results. We are, from time-to-time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs. The outcome of these cases is uncertain. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. 15Table of Contents In recent years, regulatory enforcement and fines have increased across the banking and financial services sector.  There is no assurance that those actions will not result in regulatory settlements or other enforcement actions against the Company or the Bank.  Furthermore, a single event involving a potential violation of law or regulation may give rise to numerous and overlapping investigations and proceedings by multiple federal and state agencies and officials.  In addition, if one or more financial institutions are found to have violated a law or regulation relating to certain business activities, this could lead to investigations by regulators or other governmental agencies of the same or similar activities by other financial institutions, including the Company, and large fines and remedial measures that may have been imposed in resolving earlier investigations for the same or similar activities at other financial institutions may be used as the basis for future settlements. We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.  See the Contingencies section of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively. Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete. The soundness of other financial institutions may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. We have experienced increases in FDIC insurance assessments due to the bank failures that occurred in 2023. In November 2023, the FDIC implemented a special assessment to recover the loss to the Deposit Insurance Fund following the failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank earlier in the year.  The assessment was based on reported uninsured deposits as of December 31, 2022.  The Company's share of the FDIC special assessment was $14.7 million which was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 and is payable in eight quarterly installments starting in June 2024.  In February 2024, the FDIC updated the loss estimate related to the bank failures to $20.4 billion, and increase from its original estimate of $16.3 billion. Based on the FDIC’s modified loss estimate, we expect an increase in special assessment expense in, or around, June 2024; however, we expect the increase will not be material.  Further increases in our assessment fees may have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.  "
12,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2023-03-01,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are what management believes are the material risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company.Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions Adverse changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings.Our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, public unrest, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including the COVID-19 pandemic, and Federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including continuing military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events.8Table of Contents The impacts of various travel restrictions and quarantine requirements for visitors to Hawaii in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic had a dramatic negative impact on tourism and general economic conditions in our markets.  Although there has been significant improvement in tourism and general economic conditions, COVID-19 continues to impact Hawaii and the Pacific Islands, including a lagging recovery in international tourism. Deterioration of economic conditions, locally, nationally, and internationally could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues, higher expenses, and lower earnings.  The level of domestic and international visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Climate change and the governmental responses to it could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its customersThe impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and rising sea levels, could impact the Bank’s operations as well as those of its customers and third party vendors upon which it relies.  Such events could also result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay outstanding loans, or result in the deterioration of the value of our collateral causing a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial condition and results of operation.  Furthermore, increasing regulation related to climate change could have an adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the Bank and its customers, including our credit portfolio.  Further legislation and regulatory requirements could increase the operating expenses of, or otherwise adversely impact, the Bank or its customers.  To the extent that the Bank or its customers experience increases in costs, reductions in the value of assets, constraints on operations or similar concerns driven by changes in regulation relating to climate change, the Bank’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the Hawaii economy and our business, the extent of the impact on our business and our financial results remains uncertain.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.  The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects still cannot be determined with a reasonable level of certainty.  We have experienced unprecedented levels of government stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and have seen certain economic activities recovering since 2020, however, the lasting impacts of which are unknown. Novel viruses such as COVID-19 increase concerns related to illness when traveling and gathering in large numbers.  In response, the majority of the nation’s state and local jurisdictions imposed various restrictions in order to control the spread of COVID-19.  Though most of these restrictions have now been lifted there is the possibility that they could be imposed again in the future.Even as more and more individuals become fully vaccinated against COVID-19, prior and any future travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a lasting impact on tourism spending in Hawaii.  Because many of our customers, both commercial and consumer, derive at least some of their income from tourism, a dramatic drop in tourism spending affects them directly, as well as the Hawaii economy as a whole.  A downturn in the Hawaii economy and widespread reduction to our customers’ income in turn will have a negative impact on our operations.  We are unable to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios.The COVID-19 pandemic, the institution of physical distancing, and shelter-in-place requirements resulted in both temporary and permanent closures of many businesses.  As a result, the demand for our products and services has been and may continue to be significantly impacted.  Our operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.  We had temporarily closed certain of our branches and permanently closed others. Many employees are now working remotely or on a hybrid schedule.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions.  We continue to work with our customers after the initial assistance programs expired.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios will depend on the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities, actions taken by other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, all of which are highly uncertain.9Table of Contents Any reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital.Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads.  If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.Increased credit losses for the Bank could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated expected credit losses over the life of the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolios in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Consumer protection initiatives and court decisions related to the foreclosure process affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.In addition, Hawaii’s appellate courts have made rulings that increase the complexity and risk of nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  At the same time, a chronic backlog of cases in the Hawaii courts has slowed the judicial foreclosure process, which delays the Bank’s ability to take over, preserve, and sell the mortgaged property.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures and costs, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments or move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management, thereby decreasing our investment management revenues.10Table of Contents The Parent’s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, dividends on the Parent’s common and preferred stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent’s share repurchase program.  Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent.  The Parent’s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited if federal and state laws and regulations further limit the amount of dividends the Bank is permitted to pay the Parent.There can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2022, the Parent repurchased 627,629 shares of common stock at a total cost of $49.8 million under its share repurchase program.  We suspended share repurchases from March 2020 to July 2021 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $112.6 million on common shares during 2022.  In January 2023, the Parent’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share on the Parent’s outstanding common shares.  Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.  Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. Risks Related to Regulatory ChangesThe end of LIBOR may adversely affect our financial instruments that are directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar LIBOR settings.  In addition, U.S. banking regulatory agencies issued guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021.  At the same time, various alternative rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), have begun to be used more widely in both loan and derivative products.   We have loans, derivative contracts, and other financial instruments with rates that are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR.  As the transition progresses, the interest rates on these instruments, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with the same, may be adversely affected.  Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers, could adversely impact our reputation. The transition continues to be overseen by an enterprise-wide, cross-functional project team that reports to executive management on an ongoing basis.  The project team is organized around key work streams, which cover the products, systems, and operational processes impacted by the transition as well as client communication.  Since its formation, the project team has overseen the transition to non-LIBOR based adjustable rate mortgages and floating rate commercial loans as well as related customer derivatives (LIBOR-based ARMs no longer offered since November 2020 and LIBOR-based commercial loans no longer offered since December 2021) and continues to work toward facilitating the transition of legacy LIBOR products.  Fiscal and Monetary Policy changes may significantly impact our profitability and liquidity The Company’s business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government and its agencies.  The Bank is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States.  Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.  These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.  Changes to these policies of the Federal Reserve may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.11Table of Contents Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new interpretations, restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company’s business.The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act, other consumer protection laws, and their implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs, along with possible restrictions on our products, services and manner of operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.The CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  Staff changes to key positions within the CFPB by the Biden administration may result in the CFPB pursuing more strict enforcement policies, similar to that experienced under the Obama administration.  Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remains with the FRB.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products as a whole, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations, which also could result in increased costs as well as harm to our reputation in the event of a finding that we have not complied with the increased regulatory requirements.New laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be implemented, interpreted, repealed or reinstated, in the current regulatory and political climate, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.  Further, leadership and staff changes in regulatory agencies such as the CFPB, CFTC, SEC, and the Treasury Department could lead to changes in the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies.  The potential impact of any changes within these agencies cannot be predicted at this time.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.Compliance with Basel III resulted in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the “Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry” section in MD&A for more information.Changes in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Further changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  For example, the Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022, and introduced, among provisions, a new corporate minimum income tax on certain large corporations, an excise tax of 1% on certain share repurchases by corporations, and increased funding for the Internal Revenue Service.  Although we do not anticipate the new corporate minimum income tax will currently apply to us, changes in our business and any future regulations or other guidance on the interpretation and application of the new corporate minimum tax, as well as the potential application of the share repurchase excise tax, may result in additional taxes payable by us, which could materially and adversely affect our financial results and operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Business OperationsA failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial 12Table of Contents intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  In addition, our communications and information systems and operations (including those of third parties that facilitate our business activities) could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures, and similar events or disruptions.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.An interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, intelligence-gathering by foreign governments, or from accidental technological failure internally or by our vendors.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent emails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our customers’ devices.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving other companies’ losses of customer personal and financial information, we believe this risk could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs through the ongoing cost of technology investments to improve security, as well as the potential financial and reputational impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company.13Table of Contents Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus making it virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial and personal information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.  Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.  For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.  These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.Our mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change.We act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”) such as Fannie Mae.  As a seller and servicer for those loans, we make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements.  We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements.  We may be penalized and, in limited instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements.  Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs.Risks related to representation and warranty provisions may impact our mortgage loan servicing businessThe Company sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to Fannie Mae.  The Company also pools Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) insured and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to Ginnie Mae.  These pools of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans are securitized by Ginnie Mae.  The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans.  Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover ownership of the loan, validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and other matters.  As of December 31, 2022, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold by the Company was $2.1 billion.  The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian.  Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, the Company may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met.  Some agreements may require the Company to repurchase delinquent loans.  Upon receipt of a repurchase request, the Company works with investors or insurers to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution.  Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor or insurer and to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred.  The Company manages the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through its underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards.  For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company repurchased six residential mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance totaling $1.6 million as a result of the representation and warranty provisions contained in these contracts.  The loans were delinquent as to principal and interest at the time of repurchase, however, no material losses were incurred related to these repurchases.14Table of Contents Risks relating to residential mortgage loan servicing activities may adversely affect our results.In addition to servicing loans in the Company’s portfolio, substantially all of the loans the Company sells to investors are sold with servicing rights retained.  The Company also services loans originated by other mortgage loan originators.  As servicer, the Company’s primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the documents governing a securitization, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales.  Each agreement under which the Company acts as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements.  However, if the Company commits a material breach of obligations as servicer, the Company may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice.  The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor.  These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company.  Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to reserve for credit losses in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any credit allowance recognized will be measured as the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected over the security’s lifetime.Natural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations.Real estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.  The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii with its unique weather and geology.  Our business operations could suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to damage from weather or other natural disasters.  Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.  A natural disaster in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands could cause property values in the affected areas to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements.  A natural disaster could also impact borrowers’ ability to pay their financial obligations, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults. General Risk Factors
Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial technology companies and financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs, and may benefit from tax exemptions or lower tax rates.  As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures.We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.Both federal and local laws provide mechanisms for out-of-state banks and their holding companies to acquire or open branches in our service territories.  Failure to effectively address this competitive risk by competing, innovating and making effective use of new and existing channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.15Table of Contents Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal and/or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.We are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.We are, from time-to-time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  The outcome of these cases is uncertain.  Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.  See the Contingencies section of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.The soundness of other financial institutions may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.  "
13,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2022-03-01,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are what management believes are the material risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company.Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions Adverse changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings.Our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, public unrest, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  Additionally, financial markets may be adversely affected by the current or anticipated impact of military conflict, including escalating military tension between Russia and Ukraine, terrorism or other geopolitical events.The impacts of various travel restrictions and quarantine requirements for visitors to Hawaii has had a dramatic negative impact on tourism.  These events have contributed to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which has impacted and will continue to adversely impact us and our customers’ operations.  Though there has been an increase in tourism and economic recovery recently, many of the impacts in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands still linger. Deterioration of economic conditions, locally, nationally, and internationally could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues, higher expenses, and lower earnings.  The level of international visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Climate change and the governmental responses to it could have a material adverse impact on the Bank and its customersThe impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, natural disasters and rising sea levels, could impact the Bank’s operations as well as those of its customers and third party vendors upon which it relies.  Such events could also result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers’ ability to pay outstanding loans, or result in the deterioration of the value of our collateral causing a material adverse effect on the Bank’s financial condition and results of operation.  Furthermore, increasing regulation related to climate change could have an adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the Bank and its customers, including our credit portfolio.  Further legislation and regulatory requirements could increase the operating expenses of, or otherwise adversely impact, the Bank or its customers.  To the extent that the Bank or its customers experience increases in costs, reductions in the value of assets, constraints on operations or similar concerns driven by changes in regulation relating to climate change, the Bank’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the Hawaii economy and our business, the extent of the impact on our business and our financial results remains uncertain.The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.  The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects still cannot be determined with a reasonable level of certainty.  We have experienced unprecedented levels of government stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and have seen certain economic activities recovering since 2020, however, the lasting impacts of which are unknown. Novel viruses such as COVID-19 increase concerns related to illness when traveling and gathering in large numbers.  In response, the majority of the nation’s state and local jurisdictions imposed various restrictions in order to control the spread of COVID-19.  Though most of these restrictions have now been lifted there is the possibility that they could be imposed again in the future.9Table of Contents Even as more and more individuals become fully vaccinated against COVID-19, prior travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a lasting impact on tourism spending in Hawaii.  Because many of our customers, both commercial and consumer, derive at least some of their income from tourism, this dramatic drop in tourism spending affects them directly, as well as the Hawaii economy as a whole.  A downturn in the Hawaii economy and widespread reduction to our customers’ income will have a negative impact on our operations.  We are unable to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios.The COVID-19 pandemic, the institution of physical distancing, and shelter-in-place requirements resulted in both temporary and permanent closures of many businesses.  As a result, the demand for our products and services has been and may continue to be significantly impacted.  Our operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.  We have already temporarily or permanently closed certain of our branches and offices and many employees are now working remotely.  Though we have re-opened most of our branches, others remain closed.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions.  Foreclosures and evictions remain suspended.  We continue to work with our customers as many of the initial assistance programs have now expired.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios will depend on the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities, actions taken by other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, all of which are highly uncertain.Any reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital.Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads.  If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further.Increased credit losses for the Bank could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated expected credit losses over the life of the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolios in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.10Table of Contents Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Consumer protection initiatives and court decisions related to the foreclosure process affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.In addition, Hawaii’s appellate courts have made rulings that increase the complexity and risk of nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  At the same time, a chronic backlog of cases in the Hawaii courts has slowed the judicial foreclosure process, which delays the Bank’s ability to take over, preserve, and sell the mortgaged property.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures and costs, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments or move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management, thereby decreasing our investment management revenues.The Parent’s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, dividends on the Parent’s common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent’s share repurchase program.  Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent.  The Parent’s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited if federal and state laws and regulations further limit the amount of dividends the Bank is permitted to pay the Parent.There can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2021, the Parent repurchased 328,832 shares of common stock at a total cost of $27.3 million under its share repurchase program.  We suspended share repurchases from March 2020 to July 2021 in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $110.6 million on common shares during 2021.  In January 2022, the Parent’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.70 per share on the Parent’s outstanding common shares.  Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.  Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. 11Table of Contents  Risks Related to Regulatory ChangesThe end of LIBOR may adversely affect our financial instruments that are directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR. On March 5, 2021, the UK Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, confirmed that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021 for 1-week and 2-month US dollar LIBOR and immediately after June 30, 2023 for all remaining US dollar LIBOR settings.  In addition, U.S. banking regulatory agencies issued guidance encouraging banks to cease entering into new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate by December 31, 2021.  At the same time, various alternative rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), have begun to be used more widely in both loan and derivative products.   We have loans, derivative contracts, and other financial instruments with rates that are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR.  As the transition progresses, the interest rates on these instruments, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with the same, may be adversely affected.  Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers, could adversely impact our reputation. The Company formed an enterprise-wide, cross-functional project team to oversee the transition.  The project team reports to a steering committee as well as Management and the Board on a periodic basis.  The project team is organized around key work streams, which cover the products, systems, and operational processes impacted by the transition as well as client communication.  Since its formation, the project team has completed an inventory of existing LIBOR-indexed products, which is monitored on an ongoing basis, added LIBOR fallback language to new loans, and overseen the transition to non-LIBOR based adjustable rate mortgages and floating rate commercial loans.  Fiscal and Monetary Policy changes may significantly impact our profitability and liquidity The Company’s business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government and its agencies.  The Bank is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States.  Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.  These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.  Changes to these policies of the Federal Reserve may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new interpretations, restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company’s business.The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  The Dodd-Frank Act, other consumer protection laws, and their implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs, along with possible restrictions on our products, services and manner of operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.The CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  Staff changes to key positions within the CFPB by the Biden administration may result in the CFPB pursuing more strict enforcement policies, similar to that experienced under the Obama administration.  Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remains with the FRB.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products as a whole, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations, which also could result in increased costs as well as harm to our reputation in the event of a finding that we have not complied with the increased regulatory requirements.New laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be implemented, interpreted, repealed or reinstated, in the current regulatory and political climate, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability. 12Table of Contents  Bank of Hawaii and its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and applicable state regulation and supervision.  The bank regulatory scheme is primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders.  This regulatory framework affects our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes, and proposed changes can be expected from the new federal administration that took office in January 2021.  With Democratic control of the White House and both chambers of Congress there may be greater oversight of the banking industry. Further, leadership and staff changes in regulatory agencies such as the CFPB, CFTC, SEC, and the Treasury Department could lead to changes in the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies.  The potential impact of any changes within these agencies cannot be predicted at this time.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.Compliance with Basel III resulted in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the “Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry” section in MD&A for more information.Changes in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Further changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to Business OperationsA failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  In addition, our communications and information systems and operations (including those of third parties that facilitate our business activities) could be damaged or interrupted due to events such as natural or human-caused disasters (including public health crises) or extreme weather (including as a result of climate change), geopolitical events and security issues, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, operational failures, and similar events or disruptions.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.13Table of Contents An interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, intelligence-gathering by foreign governments, or from accidental technological failure internally or by our vendors.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent emails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our customers’ devices.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving other companies’ losses of customer personal and financial information, we believe this risk could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs through the ongoing cost of technology investments to improve security, as well as the potential financial and reputational impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company.Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus making it virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.14Table of Contents Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.  Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.  For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.  These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.Our mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change.We act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored entities (“GSEs”) such as Fannie Mae.  As a seller and servicer for those loans, we make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements.  We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements.  We may be penalized and, in limited instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements.  Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs.Risks related to representation and warranty provisions may impact our mortgage loan servicing businessThe Company sells residential mortgage loans in the secondary market primarily to the Fannie Mae.  The Company also pools FHA insured and VA guaranteed residential mortgage loans for sale to Ginnie Mae.  These pools of FHA-insured and VA-guaranteed residential mortgage loans are securitized by Ginnie Mae.  The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans to Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae and the insurance or guaranty agreements with FHA and VA contain provisions that include various representations and warranties regarding the origination and characteristics of the residential mortgage loans.  Although the specific representations and warranties vary among investors, insurance or guarantee agreements, they typically cover ownership of the loan, validity of the lien securing the loan, the absence of delinquent taxes or liens against the property securing the loan, compliance with loan criteria set forth in the applicable agreement, compliance with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and other matters.  As of December 31, 2021, the unpaid principal balance of residential mortgage loans sold by the Company was $2.3 billion.  The agreements under which the Company sells residential mortgage loans require delivery of various documents to the investor or its document custodian.  Although these loans are primarily sold on a non-recourse basis, the Company may be obligated to repurchase residential mortgage loans or reimburse investors for losses incurred if a loan review reveals that underwriting and documentation standards were potentially not met.  Some agreements may require the Company to repurchase delinquent loans.  Upon receipt of a repurchase request, the Company works with investors or insurers to arrive at a mutually agreeable resolution.  Repurchase demands are typically reviewed on an individual loan by loan basis to validate the claims made by the investor or insurer and to determine if a contractually required repurchase event has occurred.  The Company manages the risk associated with potential repurchases or other forms of settlement through its underwriting and quality assurance practices and by servicing mortgage loans to meet investor and secondary market standards.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased seven residential mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance totaling $0.9 million as a result of the representation and warranty provisions contained in these contracts.  The loans were delinquent as to principal and interest at the time of repurchase, however, no material losses were incurred related to these repurchases.Risks relating to residential mortgage loan servicing activities may adversely affect our results.In addition to servicing loans in the Company’s portfolio, substantially all of the loans the Company sells to investors are sold with servicing rights retained.  The Company also services loans originated by other mortgage loan originators.  As servicer, the Company’s primary duties are to: (1) collect payments due from borrowers; (2) advance certain delinquent payments of principal and interest; (3) maintain and administer any hazard, title, or primary mortgage insurance policies relating to the mortgage loans; (4) maintain any required escrow accounts for payment of taxes and insurance and administer escrow payments; and (5) foreclose on defaulted mortgage loans or, to the extent consistent with the documents governing a securitization, consider alternatives to foreclosure, such as loan modifications or short sales.  Each agreement under which the Company acts as servicer generally specifies a standard of responsibility for actions taken by the Company in such capacity and provides protection against expenses and liabilities incurred by the Company when acting in compliance with the respective servicing agreements.  However, if the Company commits a material breach of obligations as servicer, the Company may be subject to termination if the breach is not cured within a specified period following notice.  The standards governing servicing and the possible remedies for violations of such standards vary by investor.  These standards and remedies are determined by servicing guides issued by the investors as well as the contract provisions established between the investors and the Company.  Remedies could include repurchase of an affected loan.15Table of Contents  The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to reserve for credit losses in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any credit allowance recognized will be measured as the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected over the security’s lifetime.Natural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations.Real estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.  The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii with its unique weather and geology.  Our business operations could suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to damage from weather or other natural disasters.  Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.  A natural disaster in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands could cause property values in the affected areas to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements.  A natural disaster could also impact borrowers’ ability to pay their financial obligations, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults. General Risk Factors
Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial technology companies and financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs, and may benefit from tax exemptions or lower tax rates.  As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures.We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.Both federal and local laws provide mechanisms for out-of-state banks and their holding companies to acquire or open branches in our service territories.  Failure to effectively address this competitive risk by competing, innovating and making effective use of new and existing channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.We are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.We are, from time-to-time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  The outcome of these cases is uncertain.  Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  We may 16Table of Contents be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.  See the Contingencies section of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.We continue to experience higher turnover, consistent with others in the industry.  That said, the financial industry has been more resilient with signs of leveling toward the end of 2021.  Overall, sourcing and hiring of new employees has continued to keep pace with terminations.  Employee retention efforts, to include a one-time inflation adjustment in conjunction with annual merit increases to help employees with the rapid rate of inflation, continue as well.The soundness of other financial institutions may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.  "
8,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2021-03-01,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are what management believes are the material risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company.Risks Related to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions Changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, are expected to lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings.Our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, public unrest, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution and the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, and Federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.The impacts of various travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and quarantine requirements for visitors to Hawaii has had a dramatic negative impact on tourism.  These events have contributed to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which has impacted and will continue to adversely impact us and our customers’ operations.  It is uncertain how long these conditions will last or how significant the impacts will be in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.Recent deterioration of economic conditions, locally, nationally, and internationally could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues, higher expenses, and lower earnings.  In response to this deterioration, several government stimulus programs were initiated, including the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act and the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”).  The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the Hawaii economy and our business, and the extent and severity of the impact on our business and our financial results are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.The COVID-19 pandemic has had and is expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.  The duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its effects still cannot be determined with a reasonable level of certainty.  We have experienced unprecedented levels of government stimulus in response to COVID-19 in the current economic cycle, the lasting impacts of which are unknown. Novel viruses such as COVID-19 increase concerns related to illness when traveling and gathering in large numbers.  In response, the majority of the nation’s state and local jurisdictions imposed “shelter-in-place” orders, quarantines, executive orders or similar government orders and restrictions in order to control the spread of COVID-19.  Some jurisdictions have re-imposed restrictions after previously lifting them or have delayed further lifting of restrictions.  On March 23, 2020, the governor of Hawaii, signed a stay-at-home order and prohibited large gatherings.  The order contained exceptions for certain essential activities.  Furthermore, the stay-at-home order mandated all individuals arriving or returning to Hawaii by air be subject to a mandatory 10-day self-quarantine.The State of Hawaii’s stay-at-home order was originally set to expire on April 30, 2020, but was extended through May 31, 2020.  The order was subsequently changed to a safer-at-home order extended through July 31, 2020.  Subsequent orders were issued in August, September, October, November and December of 2020 with different requirements and restrictions for different islands within Hawaii.  The stay-at-home order and safer-at-home orders, along with the mandatory 10-day self-quarantine travel restrictions, have resulted in a dramatic decline in tourism in Hawaii.  Additionally, tourism has declined as various public events, attractions and venues have been closed or cancelled.  We cannot predict when these closures will end and cancellations diminish or when tourism levels in Hawaii will recover.  This decline in tourism has, and is expected to continue to have, a negative impact to the Hawaii economy and our financial results. 8Table of Contents Though some of the original restrictions have been relaxed, the mandatory 10-day self-quarantine travel restriction has been extended indefinitely.  Beginning October 15, 2020, arriving passengers and interisland travelers may avoid the self-quarantine requirements by providing proof of a recent negative test result for COVID-19 prior to boarding.  At this time Oahu is not requiring additional testing upon arrival but other islands are pursuing additional restrictions such as arrival testing.  Whether, and by how much, this will increase visitor arrivals and restore the tourism industry in Hawaii is uncertain.  In addition, these measures may be lifted or reinstated by the government as the infection rates of COVID-19 in Hawaii change, causing uncertainty and deterring travel to Hawaii.Travel restrictions and mandatory quarantines related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a lasting impact on tourism in Hawaii.  Because many of our customers, both commercial and consumer, derive at least some of their income from tourism, this dramatic drop in tourism affects them directly, as well as the Hawaii economy as a whole.  A downturn in the Hawaii economy and widespread impact to our customers’ income have a negative impact on our operations.  We are unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic and related impacts will continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital and liquidity ratios.The COVID-19 pandemic, the institution of physical distancing, and shelter-in-place requirements resulted in both temporary and permanent closures of many businesses.  As a result, the demand for our products and services has been and may continue to be significantly impacted.  The COVID-19 pandemic could prompt credit losses in our loan portfolios and increase our allowance for credit losses, particularly as businesses remain closed and as more customers draw on lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses.  Our operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, due to illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic.  We have already temporarily or permanently closed certain of our branches and offices and many employees are now working remotely.  Though we have re-opened some of our branches, others remain closed.  Similarly, though some employees have returned to the office, many continue to work remotely and it is anticipated that staffing levels at our headquarters will remain lower than pre-pandemic levels for some time.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we temporarily suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions, and involuntary automobile repossessions.  Foreclosures and evictions remain suspended.  We offered other expanded assistance to customers such as fee waivers, payment deferrals or forbearances on automobile loans and leases, mortgages, home equity loans and lines, as well as commercial, small business and personal loans. We continue to work with our customers as many of the initial assistance programs have been extended or renewed.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, results of operations, financial condition, regulatory capital, and liquidity ratios, will depend on the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions taken by governmental authorities, the availability of federal, state, or local funding programs, actions taken by other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the pace of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, all of which are highly uncertain.Any reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital.Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.9Table of Contents Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads.  If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further.Increased credit losses for the Bank could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated expected credit losses over the life of the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolios in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate further nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Consumer protection initiatives and court decisions related to the foreclosure process affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.In addition, Hawaii’s appellate courts have made rulings that increase the complexity and risk of nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  At the same time, a chronic backlog of cases in the Hawaii courts has slowed the judicial foreclosure process, which delays the Bank’s ability to take over, preserve, and sell the mortgaged property.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures and costs, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments or move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management, thereby decreasing our investment management revenues.The Parent’s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, dividends on the Parent’s common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent’s share repurchase program.  Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent.  The Parent’s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited if federal and state laws and regulations further limit the amount of dividends the Bank is permitted to pay the Parent.There can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2020, the Parent repurchased 156,358 shares of common stock at a total cost of $14.0 million under its share repurchase program.  On March 17, 2020, we suspended share repurchases in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market conditions, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $107.4 million during 2020.  In January 2021, the Parent’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.67 per share on the Parent’s outstanding shares.  10Table of Contents Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.  Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price. Risks Related to Regulatory ChangesThe anticipated end of LIBOR on December 31, 2021, may adversely affect our financial instruments that are directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR. On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR announced that after December 31, 2021, it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR.  With this announcement there is uncertainty about the continued availability of LIBOR after December 31, 2021 (which may be extended). If LIBOR ceases to be available or the methods of calculating LIBOR change from the current methods, financial products with interest rates tied to LIBOR may be adversely affected.  Even if LIBOR remains available it is uncertain whether it will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments.  We have loans, derivative contracts, and other financial instruments with rates that are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR.  If any of the foregoing were to occur, the interest rates on these instruments, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with the same, may be adversely affected. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. The Company has formed an enterprise-wide, cross-functional project team to oversee the transition.  The project team reports to a steering committee as well as Management and the Board on a periodic basis.  The project team is organized around key work streams, which cover the products, systems, and operational processes impacted by the transition as well as client communication.  In addition, the project team has completed an inventory of existing LIBOR-indexed products, which is monitored on an ongoing basis, LIBOR fallback language has been added to new loans, and LIBOR-based mortgage ARMs have been removed from our product offering. Fiscal and Monetary Policy changes may significantly impact our profitability and liquidity The Company’s business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government and its agencies.  The Bank is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States.  Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.  These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.  Changes to these policies of the Federal Reserve may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new interpretations, restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company’s business.The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  Although almost all of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, some of the rules have yet to be implemented and others are being interpreted by federal regulators and the courts.  The Dodd-Frank Act, other consumer protection laws, and their implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs, along with possible restrictions on our products, services and manner of operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.11Table of Contents The CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  Staff changes to key positions within the CFPB by the Biden administration may result in the CFPB pursuing more strict enforcement policies, similar to that experienced under the Obama administration.  Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remains with the FRB.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products as a whole, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations, which also could result in increased costs as well as harm to our reputation in the event of a finding that we have not complied with the increased regulatory requirements.New laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be implemented, interpreted, repealed or reinstated, in the current regulatory and political climate, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability. Bank of Hawaii and its nonbank subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and applicable state regulation and supervision.  The bank regulatory scheme is primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds, and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders.  This regulatory framework affects our lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy, and growth, among other things.  Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations, and policies for possible changes, and proposed changes can be expected from the new federal administration taking office in January 2021.  With Democratic control of the White House and both chambers of Congress there may be greater oversight of the banking industry.  This may include increased scrutiny of the banking industry’s efforts to provide COVID-19 relief programs as well as consumer financial rights as a whole.   Further, leadership and staff changes in regulatory agencies such as the CFPB, CFTC, SEC, and the Treasury Department could lead to changes in the rulemaking, supervision, examination and enforcement priorities and policies of the agencies.  The potential impact of any changes within these agencies cannot be predicted at this time.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.Compliance with Basel III resulted in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the “Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry” section in MD&A for more information.Changes in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Further changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations. 12Table of Contents Risks Related to Business OperationsA failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.An interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, intelligence-gathering by foreign governments, or from accidental technological failure internally or by our vendors.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent emails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our customers’ devices.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the email or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via email or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving other companies’ losses of customer personal and financial information, we believe this risk could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs through the ongoing cost of technology investments to improve security, as well as the potential financial and reputational impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company.13Table of Contents Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus making it virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.  Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.  For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.  These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.Our mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change.We act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored entities (“GSEs”) such as Fannie Mae.  As a seller and servicer for those loans, we make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements.  We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements. We may be penalized and, in limited instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements.  Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to reserve for credit losses in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any credit allowance recognized will be measured as the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected over the security’s lifetime.Natural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations.Real estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.  The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii with its unique weather and geology.  Our business operations could suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to damage from weather or other natural disasters.  Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.  A natural disaster in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands could cause property values in the affected areas to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements.  A natural disaster could also impact borrowers’ ability to pay their financial obligations, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults. 14Table of Contents General Risk Factors
Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and

1,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2020-03-02,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are what management believes are the most significant risk and uncertainties that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution and the spread of COVID-19 virus, and Federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  As a result, such events may contribute to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which could adversely impact us and our customers’ operations.  General economic conditions in Hawaii remained stable in 2019 due to low interest rates, a relatively healthy construction sector and growing visitor arrivals.  However, deterioration of economic conditions, either locally, nationally, or internationally could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues and lower earnings.  The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Any reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.  Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads.  If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected. 8Table of ContentsUncertainty about the continuing availability of LIBOR may adversely affect our businessOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR announced that after December 31, 2021, it would no longer compel banks to submit the rates required to calculate LIBOR. With this announcement there is uncertainty about the continued availability of LIBOR after 2021. If LIBOR ceases to be available or the methods of calculating LIBOR change from the current methods, financial products with interest rates tied to LIBOR may be adversely affected. Even if LIBOR remains available it is uncertain whether it will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. We have loans, derivative contracts, and other financial instruments with rates that are either directly or indirectly tied to LIBOR. If any of the foregoing were to occur, the interest rates on these instruments, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with the same, may be adversely affected. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation.  The Company is continuing its implementation efforts through its Company-wide implementation team. The implementation team meets periodically to discuss the latest developments and ensure progress is being made.Fiscal and Monetary PoliciesThe Company’s business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government and its agencies.  The Bank is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States.  Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.  These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.  Changes to these policies of the Federal Reserve may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.Although economic conditions are currently stable nationally and in Hawaii, increased credit losses for us could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolio in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new interpretations, restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company’s business.The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  Although almost all of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, some of the rules have yet to be implemented and others are being interpreted by federal regulators and the courts.  The Dodd-Frank Act, other consumer protection laws, and their implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs, along with possible restrictions on our products, services and manner of operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.9Table of ContentsThe CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remains with the FRB.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products as a whole, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations, which also could result in increased costs as well as harm to our reputation in the event of a finding that we have not complied with the increased regulatory requirements.  New laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be implemented, interpreted, repealed or reinstated, in the current regulatory and political climate, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.   Compliance with Basel III resulted in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the “Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry” section in MD&A for more information.Consumer protection initiatives and court decisions related to the foreclosure process affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.In addition, Hawaii’s appellate courts have made rulings that increase the complexity and risk of nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  At the same time, a chronic backlog of cases in the Hawaii courts has slowed the judicial foreclosure process, which delays the Bank’s ability to take over, preserve and sell the mortgaged property.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures and costs, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs, and may benefit from tax exemptions or lower tax rates.  As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures.We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.  Both federal and local laws provide mechanisms for out-of-state banks and their holding companies to acquire or open branches in our service territories.  Failure to effectively address this competitive risk by competing, innovating and making effective use of new and existing channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.10Table of ContentsA failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.An interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operating systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, intelligence-gathering by foreign governments, or from accidental technological failure internally or by our vendors.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent E-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our customers’ devices.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the E-mail or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via E-mail or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving other companies’ losses of customer personal and financial information, we believe this risk could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs through the ongoing cost of technology investments to improve security, as well as the potential financial and reputational impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company.  11Table of ContentsAlthough we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.We are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.We are, from time-to-time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  The outcome of these cases is uncertain.  Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.  See the Contingencies section of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Changes in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Further changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.12Table of ContentsThe soundness of other financial institutions may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments, move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management and thereby decrease our investment management revenues. Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.  Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.  For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.  These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.Our mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change. We act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored entities (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae.  As a seller and servicer for those loans, we make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements.  We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements. We may be penalized and, in limited instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements.  Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to reserve for credit losses in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any credit allowance recognized will be measured as the difference between the security’s amortized cost basis and the amount expected to be collected over the security’s lifetime.The Parent’s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, for example, dividends on the Parent’s common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent’s share repurchase program. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent.  The Parent’s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited if federal and state laws and regulations further limit the amount of dividends the Bank is permitted to pay the Parent.13Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2019, the Parent repurchased 1,642,998 shares of common stock at a total cost of $134.7 million under its share repurchase program.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $105.5 million during 2019.  In January 2020, the Parent’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.67 per share on the Parent’s outstanding shares.  In addition, from January 1, 2020 through February 14, 2020, the Parent repurchased an additional 114,358 shares of common stock at an average cost of $92.63 per share and a total cost of $10.6 million.Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.  Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Natural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations.Real estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.  The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii with its unique weather and geology.  Our business operations could suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to damage from weather or other natural disasters.  Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.  A natural disaster in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands could cause property values in the affected areas to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements.  A natural disaster could also impact borrowers’ ability to pay their financial obligations, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults. Potential impacts from novel viruses and an increase in concern about the risk of illness are likely to adversely impact tourism in Hawaii and results from operations.Novel viruses, such as COVID-19, increase concerns related to illness when traveling, and travel restrictions related to the outbreak appear likely to cause a drop in tourism in Hawaii.  Because many of our customers, both commercial and consumer, derive some or all of their income from tourism, any drop in tourism may affect them as well as the Hawaii economy as a whole.  A downturn in the Hawaii economy or widespread impact to our customers’ income could have an impact on our operations that is difficult for us to forecast though it may be material.  The Company is monitoring this changing environment, taking appropriate anticipatory actions and responding accordingly.14Table of Contents"
4,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2019-03-01,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are some of the important inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution, and Federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  As a result, such events may contribute to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which could adversely impact us and our customers’ operations.  General economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy in 2018, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry.  However, deterioration of economic conditions, either locally, nationally, or internationally could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues and lower earnings.  The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Any reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.  Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads.  If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected. 8Table of ContentsFiscal and Monetary PoliciesThe Company’s business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the Federal Government and its agencies.  The Bank is particularly affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States.  Among the instruments of monetary policy available to the Federal Reserve are (a) conducting open market operations in U.S. government securities, (b) changing the discount rates of borrowings of depository institutions, (c) imposing or changing reserve requirements against depository institutions’ deposits, and (d) imposing or changing reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates.  These methods are used in varying degrees and combinations to directly affect the availability of bank loans and deposits, as well as the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits.  Changes to these policies of the Federal Reserve may have a material effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.Although economic conditions are currently healthy nationally and in Hawaii, increased credit losses for us could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolio in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new interpretations, restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company’s business.The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  Although almost all of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, some of the rules have yet to be implemented and others are being interpreted by federal regulators and the courts.  The Dodd-Frank Act, other consumer protection laws, and their implementing rules and regulations are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs, along with possible restrictions on our products, services and manner of operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.The CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remains with the FRB.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products as a whole, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations, which also could result in increased costs as well as harm to our reputation in the event of a finding that we have not complied with the increased regulatory requirements.  New laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be implemented, interpreted, repealed or reinstated, in the current regulatory and political climate, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.   Compliance with Basel III may result in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the “Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry” section in MD&A for more information.9Table of ContentsConsumer protection initiatives and court decisions related to the foreclosure process could affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.In addition, Hawaii’s appellate courts have made rulings that increase the complexity and risk of nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  At the same time, a chronic backlog of cases in the Hawaii courts has slowed the judicial foreclosure process, which may significantly delay the Bank’s ability to take over, preserve and sell the mortgaged property.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures and costs, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs, and may benefit from tax exemptions or lower tax rates.  As a result, some of these competitors may have lower cost structures.We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.  Both federal and local laws provide mechanisms for out-of-state banks and their holding companies to acquire or open branches in our service territories.  Failure to effectively address this competitive risk by competing, innovating and making effective use of new and existing channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.A failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.10Table of ContentsAn interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operations systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, intelligence-gathering by foreign governments, or from accidental technological failure internally or by our vendors.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions around the world have increased.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent E-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our customers’ computers.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the E-mail or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via E-mail or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving other companies’ losses of customer personal and financial information, we believe this risk could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs through the ongoing cost of technology investments to improve security, as well as the potential financial ad reputational impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company.  Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.11Table of ContentsNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.We are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.We are, from time-to-time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  The outcome of these cases is uncertain.  Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.  See the Contingencies section of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Changes in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Further changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.The soundness of other financial institutions may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.12Table of ContentsChanges in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments, move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management and thereby decrease our investment management revenues. Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.  Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.  For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.  These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.Our mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change. We act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored entities (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae.  As a seller and servicer for those loans, we make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements.  We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements. We may be penalized and, in limited instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements.  Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.The Parent’s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, for example, dividends on the Parent’s common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent’s share repurchase program. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent. If the amount of dividends paid by the Bank is further limited, the Parent’s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited as well.13Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2018, the Parent repurchased 1,079,397 shares of common stock at a total cost of $88.3 million under its share repurchase program.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $98.5 million during 2018.  In January 2019, the Parent’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.62 per share on the Parent’s outstanding shares.  In addition, from January 1, 2019 through February 15, 2019, the Parent repurchased an additional 298,500 shares of common stock at an average cost of $75.46 per share and a total cost of $22.5 million.Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time-to-time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.  Dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Natural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations.Real estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.  The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii with its unique weather and geology.  Our business operations could suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to damage from weather or other natural disasters.  Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.  A natural disaster in Hawaii or the Pacific Islands could cause property values in the affected areas to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements.  A natural disaster could also impact borrowers’ ability to pay their financial obligations, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults. 14Table of Contents"
6,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2018-02-28,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are some of the important inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution, and Federal, State of Hawaii and local government budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  As a result, such events may contribute to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which could adversely impact us and our customers’ operations.  General economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy in 2017, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry.  However, deterioration of economic conditions, either locally or nationally, could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues and lower earnings.  The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Any reduction in defense spending by the federal government could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  We primarily rely on customer deposits as a sizable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.  Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads.  If we are unable to continue to fund loans and other assets through customer deposits or access capital markets on favorable terms or if we otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectively, our liquidity, net interest margin, financial results and conditions may be adversely affected. Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.9Table of ContentsAlthough economic conditions are currently healthy nationally and in Hawaii, increased credit losses for us could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolio in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company’s business.After the financial crisis which began in 2008, regulators increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions.  Laws and regulations, and in particular banking and securities laws, are under intense scrutiny.  The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  Although many of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, some of the rules have yet to be implemented and will require further interpretation and rulemaking by federal regulators.  We are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as statements and initiatives by the new administration regarding potential delay or cancellation of such rulemaking, in our efforts to comply with these new laws and regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing rules and regulations have resulted and are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs and fees, along with possible restrictions on our operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.The CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations and/or investigations, which also could result in increased costs and harm to our reputation in the event of a failure to comply with the increased regulatory requirements.  All of these rules have created challenges for product and service offerings, operations and compliance programs for the Company.Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remain with the FRB.  Many of the rules and regulations of the CFPB have not been implemented, and therefore, the scope and impact of the CFPB’s actions cannot be determined at this time.  This creates significant uncertainty for us and for the financial services industry in general.These new laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be fully implemented, repealed or reinstated, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements and the introduction of stress testing requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.  The phase-in period for the final rules began for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule’s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. On October 9, 2012, the FRB published final rules implementing the stress testing requirements for banks, such as the Company, with total consolidated assets of more than $10.0 billion but less than $50.0 billion.  The final stress testing rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities, as well as rules governing controls, oversight and disclosure.Compliance with Basel III and the results of our stress testing may result in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the “Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry” section in MD&A for more information.10Table of ContentsConsumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process could affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.Hawaii has overhauled its rules for nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  The revised rules have had the unintended effect of many lenders forgoing nonjudicial foreclosures entirely and filing all foreclosures in court, creating a backlog that has slowed the judicial foreclosure process.  In addition, the joint federal-state settlement with several mortgage servicers over foreclosure practice abuses creates additional uncertainty for the Company, and the mortgage servicing industry in general, as it relates to the implementation of mortgage loan modifications and loss mitigation practices in the future.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies, all of which may be based in or outside of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs.  As a result, some of our competitors may have lower cost structures.  Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.  Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, banks and bank holding companies from any state are permitted to acquire banks located in any other state, subject to certain conditions, including certain nationwide and state-imposed deposit concentration limits.  Because the Code permits de novo branching by out-of-state banks, those banks may establish new branches in Hawaii.  Interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located. Failure to effectively compete, innovate, and to make effective use of available channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.A failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.An interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or from accidental technological failure.  Further, to access our products and services our 11Table of Contentscustomers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including payment card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operations systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, payment card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our customers’ computers.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the e-mail or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via e-mail or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile data breaches involving customer personal and financial information, we believe the potential impact of a cyber security incident involving the Company, any exposure to consumer losses and the cost of technology investments to improve security could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs.  Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber-attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.12Table of ContentsWe are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.We are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  The outcome of these cases is uncertain.  Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.  See the Contingencies section of Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.Changes in income tax laws and interpretations, or in accounting standards, could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Further changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.The soundness of other financial institutions, as counterparties, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments, move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management and thereby decrease our investment management revenues. 13Table of ContentsOur mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.  Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.  For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.  These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.Our mortgage loan servicing business may be impacted if we do not meet our obligations, or if servicing standards change. We act as servicer for mortgage loans sold into the secondary market, primarily to government sponsored entities (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae.  As a seller and servicer for those loans, we both make warranties about their origination and are required to perform servicing according to complex contractual and handbook requirements.  We maintain systems and procedures intended to ensure that we comply with these requirements. We may be penalized and, in rare instances required to repurchase certain mortgages, due to alleged failures to adhere to these requirements.  Should GSEs change the requirements in their servicing handbooks, we may sustain higher compliance costs.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.The Parent’s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, for example, dividends on the Parent’s common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent’s share repurchase program. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent. If the amount of dividends paid by the Bank is further limited, the Parent’s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited as well.14Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2017, the Parent repurchased 549,199 shares of common stock at a total cost of $45.0 million under its share repurchase program.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $87.1 million during 2017.  In January 2018, the Parent’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share on the Parent’s outstanding shares.  In addition, from January 1, 2018 through February 16, 2018, the Parent repurchased an additional 80,000 shares of common stock at an average cost of $84.27 per share and a total cost of $6.7 million.Whether we continue, and the amount and timing of, such dividends and/or stock repurchases is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.  A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Natural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property values and bank operations.Real estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.  The Bank owns or leases many real estate properties in connection with its operations, primarily located in Hawaii.  Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.  A natural disaster could cause property values to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements.  A natural disaster could also impact collateral values, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults.  Our business operations could also suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to weather-related damage.15Table of Contents"
9,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2017-02-27,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are some of the important inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution, and Federal, State of Hawaii and County budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  As a result, such events may contribute to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which could adversely impact us and our customers’ operations.  General economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy in 2016, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry.  However, deterioration of economic conditions, either locally or nationally, could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues and lower earnings.  The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Changes in defense spending by the federal government as a result of congressional budget cuts could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.  Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.Although economic conditions are currently healthy nationally and in Hawaii, increased credit losses for us could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolio in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  9Table of ContentsShould economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company’s business.In light of the financial crisis which began in 2008, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions.  Laws and regulations, and in particular banking and securities laws, are under intense scrutiny.  The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  Although many of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, some of the rules required to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be implemented and will require further interpretation and rulemaking by federal regulators.  We are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as statements and initiatives by the new administration regarding potential delay or cancellation of such rulemaking, in our efforts to comply with these new laws and regulations.  The Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing rules and regulations have resulted and are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs and fees, along with possible restrictions on our operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.The CFPB has exercised its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations and/or investigations, which also could result in increased costs and harm to our reputation in the event of a failure to comply with the increased regulatory requirements.  All of these rules have created challenges for product and service offerings, operations and compliance programs for the Company.Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remain with the FRB.  Many of the rules and regulations of the CFPB have not been implemented, and therefore, the scope and impact of the CFPB’s actions cannot be determined at this time.  This creates significant uncertainty for us and for the financial services industry in general.These new laws, regulations, and changes, and the uncertainty surrounding whether such laws, regulations and changes will be fully implemented, repealed or reinstated, may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements and the introduction of stress testing requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.  The phase-in period for the final rules began for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule’s requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. On October 9, 2012, the FRB published final rules implementing the stress testing requirements for banks, such as the Company, with total consolidated assets of more than $10.0 billion but less than $50.0 billion.  The final stress testing rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities, as well as rules governing controls, oversight and disclosure.Compliance with Basel III and the results of our stress testing may result in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the “Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry” section in MD&A for more information.10Table of ContentsConsumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process could affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.Hawaii has overhauled its rules for nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  The revised rules have had the unintended effect of many lenders forgoing nonjudicial foreclosures entirely and filing all foreclosures in court, creating a backlog that has slowed the judicial foreclosure process.  In addition, the joint federal-state settlement with several mortgage servicers over foreclosure practice abuses creates additional uncertainty for the Company, and the mortgage servicing industry in general, as it relates to the implementation of mortgage loan modifications and loss mitigation practices in the future.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies, all of which may be based in or outside of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs.  As a result, some of our competitors may have lower cost structures.  Also, some of our competitors, through delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.  Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, banks and bank holding companies from any state are permitted to acquire banks located in any other state, subject to certain conditions, including certain nationwide and state-imposed deposit concentration limits.  Because the Code permits de novo branching by out-of-state banks, those banks may establish new branches in Hawaii.  Interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located. Failure to effectively compete, innovate, and to make effective use of available channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.The Parent’s liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, for example, dividends on the Parent’s common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent’s share repurchase program.  Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent.  If the amount of dividends paid by the Bank is further limited, the Parent’s ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited as well.A failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.11Table of ContentsAn interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or from accidental technological failure.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations and requirements regarding operational and information security have increased, our operations systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through “trojan horse” programs to our customers’ computers.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the e-mail or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via e-mail or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber-crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile retail data breaches involving customer personal and financial information, we believe the potential impact on the Company and any exposure to consumer losses and the cost of technology investments to improve security could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs.  Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.

Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.12Table of ContentsNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion, could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.

We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.13Table of ContentsChanges in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments, move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management and thereby decrease our investment management revenues. Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.  Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights.  Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio.  For example, we may occasionally decide to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio (as opposed to selling the loans in the secondary market) which would reduce our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.  These variables could adversely affect mortgage banking income.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.There can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2016, the Parent repurchased 847,964 shares of common stock at a total cost of $58.0 million under its share repurchase program.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $81.2 million during 2016.  In January 2017, the Parent’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.50 per share on the Parent’s outstanding shares.  In addition, from January 1, 2017 through February 15, 2017, the Parent repurchased an additional 51,500 shares of common stock at an average cost of $86.39 per share and a total cost of $4.4 million.Whether we continue, and the amount and timing of, such dividends and/or stock repurchases is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.  A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.Natural disasters and adverse weather could negatively affect real estate property and bank operations.Real estate and real estate property values play an important role for the Bank in several ways.  The Bank owns many real estate properties, primarily located in Hawaii.  Real estate is also utilized as collateral for many of our loans.  A natural disaster could cause property values to fall, which could require the Bank to record an impairment on its financial statements.  A natural disaster could also impact collateral values, which would increase our exposure to loan defaults.  Our business operations could also suffer to the extent the Bank cannot utilize its branch network due to weather-related damage.14Table of Contents"
0,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2016-02-29,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are some of the important inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse effect on the Company. Changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii, Guam and other Pacific Islands, could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, the U.S. military, real estate, construction, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution, and Federal, State of Hawaii and County budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  As a result, such events may contribute to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which could adversely impact us and our customers' operations.  General economic conditions in Hawaii remained healthy in 2015, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an active construction industry.  However, deterioration of economic conditions, either locally or nationally, could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues and lower earnings.  The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Changes in defense spending by the federal government as a result of congressional budget cuts could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability and willingness of the U.S. Government to enact legislation.  U.S. Government appropriations have been and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.  Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.Although economic conditions are currently healthy nationally and in Hawaii, increased credit losses for us could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolio in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  9Table of ContentsShould economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company's business.In light of the financial crisis which began in 2008, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions.  Laws and regulations, and in particular banking and securities laws, are under intense scrutiny.  The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  Although many of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, some of the rules required to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be implemented and will require further interpretation and rulemaking by federal regulators.  We are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act in our efforts to comply with these new laws and regulations.  While the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on us cannot currently be determined, the law and its implementing rules and regulations have resulted and are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs and fees, along with possible restrictions on our operations, any of which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.  The CFPB has begun to exercise its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer financial products, as well as expanded data collection and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  The CFPB has recently focused its rulemaking in several areas, particularly in the area of mortgage reform involving the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Reg X), the Truth-in-Lending Act (Reg Z), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Reg B), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  On January 10, 2014, the CFPB issued a number of new rules impacting residential mortgage lending practices.  As a result of greater regulatory scrutiny of consumer financial products, the Company has become subject to more and expanded regulatory examinations and/or investigations, which also could result in increased costs and harm to our reputation in the event of a failure to comply with the increased regulatory requirements.  All of these rules have created challenges for product and service offerings, operations and compliance programs for the Company.  Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remain with the FRB.  Many of the rules and regulations of the CFPB have not been implemented, and therefore, the scope and impact of the CFPB's actions cannot be determined at this time.  This creates significant uncertainty for us and for the financial services industry in general.These new laws, regulations, and changes may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.  The future impact of the many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives on the Company's business and results of operations will depend upon regulatory interpretation and rulemaking that still must be undertaken.  As a result, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act or of other future legislation or regulation, including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements and the introduction of stress testing requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions are required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements increased for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.  The phase-in period for the final rules began for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. On October 9, 2012, the FRB published final rules implementing the stress testing requirements for banks, such as the Company, with total consolidated assets of more than $10.0 billion but less than $50.0 billion.  The final stress testing rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities, as well as rules governing controls, oversight and disclosure.Compliance with Basel III and the results of our stress testing may result in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the ""Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry"" section in MD&A for more information.10Table of ContentsConsumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process could affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.In recent years, Hawaii overhauled its rules for nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  Previously, nonjudicial foreclosures were how most lenders handled foreclosures in Hawaii, as the process was quicker and less expensive than going through court.  The revised rules had the unintended effect of many lenders forgoing nonjudicial foreclosures entirely and filing all foreclosures in court, creating a backlog that has slowed the judicial foreclosure process.  Although some of the backlog has been cleared, many lenders continue to use the judicial foreclosure process exclusively, making the foreclosure process very lengthy.  There is discussion about further changes to the foreclosure laws in Hawaii, with the potential to create further delays for new and existing cases.  In addition, the joint federal-state settlement with several mortgage servicers over foreclosure practice abuses creates additional uncertainty for the Company and the mortgage servicing industry in general as it relates to the implementation of mortgage loan modifications and loss mitigation practices in the future.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, savings associations, credit unions, mortgage companies, finance companies, mutual funds, brokerage firms, insurance companies, and other non-traditional providers of financial services, including financial service subsidiaries of commercial and manufacturing companies, all of which may be based in or outside of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Some of our competitors are not subject to the same level of regulation and oversight that is required of banks and BHCs.  As a result, some of our competitors may have lower cost structures.  Also, some of our competitors, through alternative delivery channels such as the Internet, may be based outside of the markets that we serve.  Under the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act, banks and bank holding companies from any state are permitted to acquire banks located in any other state, subject to certain conditions, including certain nationwide and state-imposed deposit concentration limits.  Because the Code permits de novo branching by out-of-state banks, those banks may establish new branches in Hawaii.  Interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located. Failure to effectively compete, innovate, and to make effective use of available channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.The Parent's liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, for example, dividends on the Parent's common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent's share repurchase program.  Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent.  If the amount of dividends paid by the Bank is further limited, the Parent's ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited as well.A failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and 11Table of Contentswidespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.An interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and targeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may result from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or from accidental technological failure.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  As customer, public, legislative and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security have increased, our operations systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures, disruptions and breakdowns.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through ""trojan horse"" programs to our customers' computers.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the e-mail or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via e-mail or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In light of several recent high-profile retail data breaches involving customer personal and financial information, we believe the potential impact on the Company and any exposure to consumer losses and the cost of technology investments to improve security could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs.  Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and exposing the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us or reduce the level of business that our customers do with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.12Table of ContentsNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.We are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.We are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  The outcome of these cases is uncertain.  Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.Changes in income tax laws or interpretations or in accounting standards could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are issued or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.The soundness of other financial institutions, as counterparties, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.

Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.There can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2015, the Parent repurchased 802,255 shares of common stock at a total cost of $50.2 million under its share repurchase program.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $78.4 million during 2015.  In January 2016, the Parent's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share on the Parent's outstanding shares.  In addition, from January 1, 2016 through February 17, 2016, the Parent repurchased an additional 149,500 shares of common stock at an average cost of $59.50 per share and a total cost of $8.9 million.Whether we continue, and the amount and timing of, such dividends and/or stock repurchases is subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders.  We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all.

15,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2015-02-24,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.

As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. Government to enact legislation, such as appropriations bills on the debt ceiling.  U.S. Government appropriations have and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.

In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.  Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.Although economic conditions are improving nationally and in Hawaii, increased credit losses for us could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.  The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities.  We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date.  Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolio in determining the 9Table of Contentslevel of the reserve for credit losses.  Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions.  Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company's business.In light of the financial crisis which began in 2008, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions.  Laws and regulations, and in particular banking and securities laws, are under intense scrutiny.  The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  Although many of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, roughly half of the rules required to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be implemented and will require further interpretation and rulemaking by federal regulators.  We are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act in our efforts to comply with these new laws and regulations.  While the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on us cannot currently be determined, the law and its implementing rules and regulations have resulted and are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs and fees, along with possible restrictions on our operations, any of which may have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition.  The CFPB has begun to exercise its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority of consumer products, as well as expanded data collecting and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  The CFPB has recently focused its rulemaking in several areas, particularly in the areas of mortgage reform involving the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Reg X), the Truth-in-Lending Act (Reg Z), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Reg B), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  On January 10, 2014, several mortgage-related rules went into effect involving, among other things, new Ability-to-Repay requirements, standards for the “Qualified Mortgage” safe harbor, a new regulatory framework for mortgage servicing, and changes to loan originator compensation arrangements.  All of these rules have created challenges for product and service offerings, operations and compliance programs for the Company.  Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, remain with the FRB.  Many of the rules and regulations of the CFPB have not been implemented, and therefore, the scope and impact of the CFPB's actions cannot be determined at this time.  This creates significant uncertainty for us and for the financial services industry in general.These new laws, regulations, and changes may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.  The future impact of the many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives on the Company's business and results of operations will depend upon regulatory interpretation and rulemaking that still must be undertaken.  As a result, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act or of other future legislation or regulation, including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements and the introduction of stress testing requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions will be required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.  Under the final rules issued by the banking regulators, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by the Company.  The phase-in period for the final rules began for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with all of the final rule's requirements phased in over a multi-year schedule. On October 9, 2012, the FRB published final rules implementing the stress testing requirements for banks, such as the Company, with total consolidated assets of more than $10.0 billion but less than $50.0 billion, but delayed the initial stress test until the fall of 2013 (utilizing data as of September 30, 2013).  The final stress testing rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities, as well as rules governing controls, oversight and disclosure.Compliance with Basel III and the results of our stress testing may result in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements.  See the ""Regulatory Initiatives Affecting the Banking Industry"" section in MD&A for more information.10Table of ContentsConsumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process could affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.In recent years, Hawaii overhauled its rules for nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures.  Previously, nonjudicial foreclosures were how most lenders handled foreclosures in Hawaii, as the process was quicker and less expensive than going through court.  The revised rules had the unintended effect of many lenders forgoing nonjudicial foreclosures entirely and filing all foreclosures in court, creating a backlog that has slowed the judicial foreclosure process.  Although some of the backlog has been cleared, many lenders continue to use the judicial foreclosure process exclusively, making the foreclosure process very lengthy.  There is discussion about further changes to the foreclosure laws in Hawaii, with the potential to create further delays for new and existing cases.  In addition, the joint federal-state settlement with several mortgage servicers over foreclosure practice abuses creates additional uncertainty for the Company and the mortgage servicing industry in general as it relates to the implementation of mortgage loan modifications and loss mitigation practices in the future.  The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations.  Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively.  We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage companies, broker dealers, and insurance companies, all of which may be based in or outside of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues.  The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services.  Failure to effectively compete, innovate, and to make effective use of available channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.The Parent's liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank.  The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank.  These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, for example, dividends on the Parent's common stock or to repurchase common stock under the Parent's share repurchase program.  Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent.  If the amount of dividends paid by the Bank is further limited, the Parent's ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited as well.A failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business.  In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access.  These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.An interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions have been, and are likely to continue to be, the target of cybersecurity threats and attacks, which may range from uncoordinated individual attempts to sophisticated and 11Table of Contentstargeted measures directed at us.  These cybersecurity threats and attacks may include, but are not limited to, attempts to access information, including customer and company information, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.Our business requires the collection and retention of large volumes of customer data, including credit card numbers and other personally identifiable information in various information systems that we maintain and in those maintained by third parties with whom we contract to provide data services.  We also maintain important internal company data such as personally identifiable information about our employees and information relating to our operations.  The integrity and protection of that customer and company data is important to us.  Our collection of such customer and company data is subject to extensive regulation by private groups such as the payment card industry, as well as governmental authorities.Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications in attempts to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through ""trojan horse"" programs to our customers' computers.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the e-mail or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via e-mail or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In view of the recent high-profile retail data breaches involving customer personal and financial information, the potential impact on the Company and any exposure to consumer losses and the cost of technology investments to improve security could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and increase our costs.  Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows as well as damage our brand and reputation.Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.12Table of ContentsWe are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.We are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  The outcome of these cases is uncertain.  Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our financial results for any particular period.Changes in income tax laws or interpretations or in accounting standards could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect to our financial condition or results of operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are imposed or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.The soundness of other financial institutions, as counterparties, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments, move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management and thereby decrease our investment management revenues. Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity. Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in 13Table of Contentsour strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio. For example, we may occasionally change the proportion of our loan originations that are sold in the secondary market and added to our loan portfolio.Our mortgage banking income decreased in 2014 compared to 2013 primarily due to lower mortgage application and production volume as refinancing activity declined.  Also contributing to the decrease was our decision to add more conforming saleable loans to our portfolio in 2014 which reduced our gains on sales of residential mortgage loans.  Further decreases in mortgage banking income could adversely affect our results of operations.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.There can be no assurance that the Parent will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2014, the Parent repurchased 1.1 million shares of the Parent's common stock at a total cost of $60.7 million under its share repurchase program.  The Parent also paid cash dividends of $79.7 million during 2014.  In January 2015, the Parent's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share on the Parent's outstanding shares.  In addition, from January 1, 2015 through February 13, 2015, the Parent repurchased an additional 149,048 shares of common stock at an average cost of $57.16 per share and a total cost of $8.5 million.  As of February 13, 2015, remaining buyback authority was $64.7 million of the total $2.0 billion repurchase amount authorized by our Board of Directors.Whether we continue and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders. We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.14Table of Contents"
11,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2014-02-25,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to various risks resulting from changing economic, environmental, political, industry, business, financial and regulatory conditions.  The risks and uncertainties described below are some of the important inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse affect on the Company. Changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands (Guam and nearby islands), could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.  These local economies rely heavily on tourism, real estate, government, and other service-based industries.  Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, climate change, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues including Asian air pollution, and Federal, State of Hawaii and County budget issues may impact consumer and corporate spending.  As a result, such events may contribute to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which could adversely impact us and our customers' operations.  General economic conditions in Hawaii continued to be healthy in 2013, led by a strong tourism industry, relatively low unemployment, rising real estate prices, and an accelerating construction industry.  However, deterioration of economic conditions or the slow pace of economic recovery, either locally or nationally, could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues and lower earnings.  The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor.  We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made.  The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Changes in defense spending by the federal government as a result of congressional budget cuts could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate.  The funding of the U.S. military is subject to the overall U.S. Government budget and appropriation decisions and processes which are driven by numerous factors, including geo-political events, macroeconomic conditions, and the ability of the U.S. Government to enact legislation, such as appropriations bills on the debt ceiling.  U.S. Government appropriations have and likely will continue to be affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation.  Cuts in defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings.  Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings.  In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers.  Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities.  Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits.  Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.Although economic conditions are improving nationally and in Hawaii, increased credit losses for us could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.

Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including new restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company's business.In light of current conditions and the market expectation of a slow economic recovery, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions.  Laws and regulations, and in particular banking, securities and tax laws, are under intense scrutiny because of the current economic environment.  The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, triggered sweeping reforms to the financial services industry.  Although many of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, roughly half of the rules required to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be implemented and will require further interpretation and rulemaking by federal regulators.  We are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations.  While the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on us cannot currently be determined, the law and its implementing rules and regulations have resulted and are likely to continue to result in increased compliance costs and fees, along with possible restrictions on our operations, any of which may have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition.  The regulation of most consumer financial products and services is now centralized in the CFPB, where it has begun to exercise its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority, as well as expanded data collecting and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets.  The CFPB has recently focused its rulemaking in several areas, particularly in the areas of mortgage reform involving the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Reg X), the Truth-in-Lending Act (Reg Z), the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (Reg B), and the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  In January 2013, the CFPB issued six mortgage-related rulemakings involving, among other things, new Ability-to-Repay requirements, standards for the “Qualified Mortgage” safe harbor, a new regulatory framework for mortgage servicing, and changes to loan originator compensation arrangements, all of which will create challenges for product and service offerings, operations and compliance programs.  These rules became effective January 10, 2014.Regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, will remain with the FRB.  Many of the rules and regulations of the CFPB have not been implemented, and therefore, the scope and impact of the CFPB's actions cannot be determined at this time.  This creates significant uncertainty for the Company and the financial services industry in general.These new laws, regulations, and changes may continue to increase our costs of regulatory compliance.  They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability.  The future impact of the many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives on the Company's business and results of operations will depend upon regulatory interpretation and rulemaking that will be undertaken over the next several months and years.  As a result, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act or of other future legislation or regulation, including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements and the introduction of stress testing requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, financial institutions will be required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital.

These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers.  These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints.  Although we have safeguards and business continuity plans in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.11Table of ContentsAn interruption or breach in security of our information systems or those related to merchants and third party vendors, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions, have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events.  These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure.  Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems.  The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, bank account information or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through ""trojan horse"" programs to our customers' computers.  These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the e-mail or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via e-mail or download a program.  Despite our efforts to mitigate these threats through product improvements, use of encryption and authentication technology to secure online transmission of confidential consumer information, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds against us or our merchants and our third party service providers remain a serious issue.  The pervasiveness of cyber security incidents in general and the risks of cyber crime are complex and continue to evolve.  In view of the recent high-profile retail data breaches involving customer personal and financial information, the potential impact on the Company and any exposure to consumer losses and the cost of technology investments to improve security could cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and an increase in our costs.  Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.  Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected.  Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, and thus it is virtually impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk.  A security breach or other significant disruption could: 1) Disrupt the proper functioning of our networks and systems and therefore our operations and/or those of certain of our customers; 2) Result in the unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours or our customers, including account numbers and other financial information; 3) Result in a violation of applicable privacy, data breach and other laws, subjecting the Bank to additional regulatory scrutiny and expose the Bank to civil litigation, governmental fines and possible financial liability; 4) Require significant management attention and resources to remedy the damages that result; or 5) Harm our reputation or cause a decrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us.  The occurrence of any such failures, disruptions or security breaches could have a negative impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.Negative public opinion could damage our reputation and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.Reputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings, liquidity, and capital from negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethical issues, or inadequate protection of customer information.  We expend significant resources to comply with regulatory requirements.  Failure to comply could result in reputational harm or significant legal or remedial costs.  Damage to our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract new customers, and adversely impact our earnings and liquidity.We are subject to certain litigation, and our expenses related to this litigation may adversely affect our results.We are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings arising from our normal business activities.  These claims and legal actions, including supervisory actions by our regulators, could involve large monetary claims and significant defense costs.  12Table of ContentsThe outcome of these cases is uncertain.  Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have material financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  We may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities, which could materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.  Based on information currently available, we believe that the eventual outcome of known actions against us will not be materially in excess of such amounts accrued by us.  However, in the event of unexpected future developments, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of those matters may be material to our statement of income for any particular period.Changes in income tax laws or interpretations or in accounting standards could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in income tax laws could be enacted, or interpretations of existing income tax laws could change, causing an adverse effect to our financial condition or results of operations.  Similarly, our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we report our financial condition and results of operations.  Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of our assets, liabilities, and financial results.  Periodically, new accounting standards are imposed or existing standards are revised, changing the methods for preparing our financial statements.  These changes are not within our control and may significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations.Our performance depends on attracting and retaining key employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.Our success is dependent on our ability to recruit qualified and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.  Competition for these qualified and skilled people is intense.  There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.  Failure to retain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualified personnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete.The soundness of other financial institutions, as counterparties, may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, lending, counterparty, or other relationships.  As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions or the financial services industry in general have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions.  We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, mutual funds, and other institutional clients.  Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client.  In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us.  Such losses could materially affect our financial condition or results of operations.Changes in the capital markets could materially affect the level of assets under management and the demand for our other fee-based services.Changes in the capital markets could affect the volume of income from and demand for our fee-based services.  Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management.  Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments, move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management and thereby decrease our investment management revenues. Our mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity. Interest rates can affect the amount of mortgage banking activity and impact fee income and the fair value of our derivative financial instruments and mortgage servicing rights. Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio. For example, we may occasionally change the proportion of our loan originations that are sold in the secondary market and added to our loan portfolio.Our mortgage banking income was particularly strong in 2012 due to high levels of loan refinancing activity and loan sales, which were the result of low interest rates.  Our mortgage banking income decreased in 2013 compared to 2012 as rising interest rates 13Table of Contentsduring 2013 adversely impacted the salable loan pipeline volume and its related loan sales margins.  Further decreases in mortgage banking income could adversely affect our results of operations.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value.  Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value.  Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk.  The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities.  Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio.  The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.There can be no assurance that we will continue to declare cash dividends or repurchase stock.During 2013, we repurchased 0.7 million shares of our common stock at a total cost of $35.5 million under our share repurchase program.  We also paid cash dividends of $80.5 million during 2013.  In January 2014, the Parent's Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share on the Parent's outstanding shares.  In addition, from January 1, 2014 through February 14, 2014, the Parent repurchased an additional 113,500 shares of common stock at an average cost of $57.85 per share and a total cost of $6.6 million.  As of February 14, 2014, remaining buyback authority was $27.4 million of the total $1.9 billion repurchase amount authorized by our Board of Directors. Whether we continue and the amount and timing of such dividends and/or stock repurchases are subject to capital availability and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interest of our shareholders. We continue to evaluate the potential impact that regulatory proposals may have on our liquidity and capital management strategies, including Basel III and those required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The actual amount and timing of future dividends and share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, federal and state regulatory restrictions, and various other factors.  In addition, the amount we spend and the number of shares we are able to repurchase under our stock repurchase program may further be affected by a number of other factors, including the stock price and blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares.  Our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases may change from time to time, and we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to declare dividends and/or repurchase stock in any particular amounts or at all. A reduction in or elimination of our dividend payments and/or stock repurchases could have a negative effect on our stock price.14Table of Contents"
7,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2013-02-26,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks and uncertainties described below are some of the important inherent risk factors that could affect our business and operations, although they are not the only risks that may have a material adverse affect on the Company. Changes in business and economic conditions, in particular those of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands (Guam and nearby islands), could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lower earnings. Unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified, our business and earnings are closely tied to the economies of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. These local economies rely heavily on tourism, real estate, government, and other service-based industries. Lower visitor arrivals or spending, real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, increases in energy costs, the availability of affordable air transportation, natural disasters and adverse weather, public health issues, and State of Hawaii and County budget issues impact consumer and corporate spending. As a result, such events may contribute to a significant deterioration in general economic conditions in our markets which could adversely impact us and our customers' operations.   Hawaii's economy continued to improve during 2012 due to increasing visitor arrivals and spending. However, deterioration of economic conditions or the slow pace of economic recovery could adversely affect the quality of our assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, which could lead to lower revenues and lower earnings. The level of visitor arrivals and spending, housing prices, and unemployment rates are some of the metrics that we continually monitor. We also monitor the value of collateral, such as real estate, that secures the loans we have made. The borrowing power of our customers could also be negatively impacted by a decline in the value of collateral.Changes in defense spending by the federal government as a result of congressional budget cuts could adversely impact the economy in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands.The U.S. military has a major presence in Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. As a result, the U.S. military is an important aspect of the economies in which we operate. Proposals to cut defense and other security spending could have an adverse impact on the economies in which we operate, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Difficult market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected our industry.The banking industry continues to be affected by a depressed real estate market, high levels of unemployment, low demand for new lending opportunities, and low interest margins. Dramatic declines in the national housing market over the past several years, with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset values by financial institutions. Although economic conditions in Hawaii and the U.S. are showing signs of improvement, a further decline in real estate values, home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment could have an adverse effect on our borrowers and/or their customers, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Continued economic conditions that negatively affect the housing market, the job market and the demand for other goods and services could cause the credit quality of the Company's loan portfolios to deteriorate, which would have a negative impact on the Company's business.Real estate values in Hawaii were somewhat more resilient than many markets on the U.S. Mainland over recent years. Furthermore, our commercial and consumer delinquencies improved in 2012. However, there is no assurance that these trends will continue in future periods.  Risks from the debt crisis in Europe could result in a disruption of the financial markets which may have a detrimental impact on global economic conditions and affect economic conditions in Hawaii. There remains considerable uncertainty as to future developments in the European debt crisis and the impact on financial markets. Market and economic disruptions have affected, and may continue to affect, consumer confidence levels, spending, and credit factors, such that our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.8Table of ContentsChanges in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operations and capital. Our earnings are highly dependent on the spread between the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in market interest rates impact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and the rates paid on deposits and borrowings. In addition, changes to market interest rates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits, and borrowings, and the credit profile of our current borrowers. Interest rates are affected by many factors beyond our control, and fluctuate in response to general economic conditions, currency fluctuations, and the monetary and fiscal policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence the origination of loans and leases, the purchase of investments, the generation of deposits, and the rates received on loans and investment securities and paid on deposits. Any substantial prolonged change in market interest rates may negatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases, and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads, any of which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.Credit losses could increase if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate.Although economic conditions are improving nationally and in Hawaii, increased credit losses for us could result if economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate. The risk of nonpayment on loans and leases is inherent in all lending activities. We maintain a reserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherent in the loan, lease, and commitment portfolios as of the balance sheet date. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the loan and lease portfolio in determining the level of the reserve for credit losses. Many of these assumptions are based on current economic conditions. Should economic conditions stagnate or deteriorate nationally or in Hawaii, we may experience higher credit losses in future periods.Inability of our borrowers to make timely repayments on their loans, or decreases in real estate collateral values may result in increased delinquencies, foreclosures, and customer bankruptcies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  Legislation and regulatory initiatives affecting the financial services industry, including restrictions and requirements, could detrimentally affect the Company's business.In light of current conditions and the market expectation of a slow economic recovery, regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of financial institutions. Laws and regulations, and in particular banking, securities and tax laws, are under intense scrutiny because of the current economic environment. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in July 2010, affected sweeping reforms to the financial services industry. Although some of the rules and regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act have already gone into effect, many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act have yet to be implemented and will require further interpretation and rulemaking by federal regulators. We are closely monitoring all relevant sections of the Dodd-Frank Act to ensure continued compliance with laws and regulations. While the ultimate effect of the Dodd-Frank Act on us cannot currently be determined, the law and its implementing rules and regulations are likely to result in increased compliance costs and fees, along with possible restrictions on our operations, any of which may have a material adverse affect on our operating results and financial condition. The regulation of most consumer financial products and services is now centralized in the CFPB, where it has begun to exercise its broad rule-making, supervisory, and examination authority, as well as expanded data collecting and enforcement powers, over depository institutions with more than $10.0 billion in assets. However, regulation of overall safety and soundness, the CRA, federal housing and flood insurance, as they pertain to consumer financial products and services, will remain with the FRB. Much of the rules and regulations of the CFPB have not been implemented, and therefore, the scope and impact of the CFPB's actions cannot be determined at this time. This creates significant uncertainty for the Company and the financial services industry in general.These new laws, regulations, and changes may increase our costs of regulatory compliance. They may significantly affect the markets in which we do business, the markets for and value of our investments, and our ongoing operations, costs, and profitability. The future impact of the many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and other legislative and regulatory initiatives on the Company's business and results of operations will depend upon regulatory interpretation and rulemaking that will be undertaken over the next several months and years. As a result, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act or of other future legislation or regulation, including the extent to which it could increase costs or limit our ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner, or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.9Table of ContentsChanges in the capital, leverage, liquidity requirements and the introduction of stress testing requirements for financial institutions could materially affect future requirements of the Company.Under Basel III, it is expected that financial institutions will be required to have more capital and a higher quality of capital. Basel III is also expected to impose a leverage ratio requirement and liquidity standards. The new minimum capital requirements were to be phased in between January 2013 and January 2015.  However, on November 9, 2012, the U.S. federal banking agencies indicated that a delay in implementation of the proposed dates was necessary, but did not provide a substitute effective date for the new rules. Implementation of these new capital and liquidity requirements has created significant uncertainty with respect to the future requirements for financial institutions. In October 2012, the FRB published final rules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act stress testing requirements for banks with total consolidated assets of more than $10.0 billion. The final stress testing rules set forth the timing and type of stress test activities as well as rules governing controls, oversight and disclosure. Compliance with Basel III and the results of our stress testing may result in increased capital, liquidity, and disclosure requirements. See the ""Regulatory Initiatives Related to Liquidity, Capital, and Stress Testing"" section in MD&A for more information.Consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process could affect our remedies as a creditor.Proposed consumer protection initiatives related to the foreclosure process, including voluntary and/or mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure, could increase our credit losses or increase our expense in pursuing our remedies as a creditor.For example, in May 2011, a new Hawaii foreclosure law (""Act 48"") overhauled rules for nonjudicial, or out-of-court, foreclosures. Previously, nonjudicial foreclosures were how lenders handled the vast majority of foreclosures in Hawaii, as the process was quicker and less expensive than going through court. Act 48 was intended to curb potential lender abuses while providing qualified owner-occupants an option to have a dispute resolution professional assist with foreclosure mitigation in front of a lender's representative before a foreclosure sale can proceed. However, Act 48 has had the unintended effect of lenders forgoing nonjudicial foreclosures entirely and filing all foreclosures in court, creating a backlog that has slowed the judicial foreclosure process. In June 2012, Act 182 was enacted partially in an attempt to modify Act 48 to make it more acceptable for lenders to pursue nonjudicial foreclosures. The manner in which these issues are ultimately resolved could impact our foreclosure procedures, which in turn could affect our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the joint federal-state settlement with several mortgage servicers over foreclosure practice abuses creates additional uncertainty for the Company and the mortgage servicing industry in general as it relates to the implementation of mortgage loan modifications and loss mitigation practices in the future.Competition may adversely affect our business.Our future depends on our ability to compete effectively. We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and other financial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts, credit unions, mortgage companies, broker dealers, and insurance companies, all of which may be based in or outside of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. We expect competitive conditions to intensify as consolidation in the financial services industry continues. The financial services industry is also likely to become more competitive as further technological advances enable more companies, including non-depository institutions, to provide financial services. Failure to effectively compete, innovate, and to make effective use of available channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.The Parent's liquidity is dependent on dividends from the Bank.The Parent is a separate and distinct legal entity from the Bank. The Parent receives substantially all of its cash in the form of dividends from the Bank. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay, for example, dividends on the Parent's common stock or to repurchase common stock under our share repurchase program. Various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the Bank may pay to the Parent. If the amount of dividends paid by the Bank is further limited, the Parent's ability to meet its obligations, pay dividends to shareholders, or repurchase stock, may be further limited as well.10Table of ContentsA failure in or breach of our operational systems, information systems, or infrastructure, or those of our third party vendors and other service providers, may result in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.We rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business. In addition, we rely on third parties to provide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and general ledger processing, internet connections, and network access. These types of information and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. These third parties with which we do business or that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing firms, financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations, could also be sources of operational and information security risk to us, including from breakdowns or failures of their own systems or capacity constraints. Although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place, our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our business and our customers, resulting in financial losses, loss of customers, or damage to our reputation.An interruption or breach in security of our information systems, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, or result in financial losses.Our technologies, systems, networks and software, and those of other financial institutions, have been and are likely to continue to be the target of cyber attacks, malicious code, computer viruses and denial of service attacks that could result in unauthorized access, misuse, loss or destruction of data (including confidential customer information), account takeovers, unavailability of service or other events. These types of threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice on the part of external or internal parties, or may result from accidental technological failure. Further, to access our products and services our customers may use computers and mobile devices that are beyond our security control systems. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, has increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. Our customers and employees have been, and will continue to be, targeted by parties using fraudulent e-mails and other communications to misappropriate passwords, credit card numbers, or other personal information or to introduce viruses or other malware through ""trojan horse"" programs to our customers' computers. These communications may appear to be legitimate messages sent by the Bank or other businesses, but direct recipients to fake websites operated by the sender of the e-mail or request that the recipient send a password or other confidential information via e-mail or download a program. Despite our efforts to mitigate these tactics through product improvements, and customer and employee education, such attempted frauds remain a serious problem that may cause customer and/or Bank losses, damage to our brand, and an increase in our costs.Although we make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our information systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption, there can be no assurance that our security efforts and measures will be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions would not be successful or damaging.

There are a limited number of qualified personnel in the markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued services of many of our current management and other key employees.

Our investment management revenues depend in large part on the level of assets under management. Market volatility that leads customers to liquidate investments, move investments to other institutions or asset classes, as well as lower asset values can reduce our level of assets under management and thereby decrease our investment management revenues. 12Table of ContentsOur mortgage banking income may experience significant volatility.Our mortgage banking income is highly influenced by the level and direction of mortgage interest rates, real estate activity, and refinancing activity.

Mortgage banking income may also be impacted by changes in our strategy to manage our residential mortgage portfolio. For example, we may occasionally change the proportion of our loan originations that are sold in the secondary market and added to our loan portfolio.Our strong mortgage banking results for 2012 were primarily due to high levels of loan refinancing activity and loan sales, which were the result of low interest rates.  We also sold loans in the secondary market at relatively higher margins in 2012 compared to prior years.  Our mortgage banking results for 2012 is not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in 2013.  Our investment in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (the ""FHLB"") stock may be subject to impairment charges in future periods if the financial condition of the FHLB declines further.The Bank is a member of the FHLB, and as such, is required to hold FHLB stock as a condition of membership. As of December 31, 2012, the carrying value of our FHLB stock was $60.2 million and consisted of 602,001 shares valued at a par value of $100 per share. Ownership of FHLB stock is restricted and the stock can only be redeemed or sold at par value and only to the FHLB or to another member institution. In August 2009, the FHLB received a capital classification of ""undercapitalized"" from its primary regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (the ""Finance Agency""). However, on September 7, 2012, the FHLB reported that its financial health has been steadily improving. As such, the Finance Agency upgraded the FHLB's classification to “adequately capitalized,” which allows it, conditions permitting, to repurchase a small amount of excess capital stock for the first time since December 2008. In 2007, the Company requested the redemption of 361,645 shares of FHLB common stock. In 2012, the FHLB redeemed 10,923 shares of their stock at par value of $100 per share for a total of $1.1 million. This redemption reduced our holdings in FHLB stock from $61.3 million as of December 31, 2011 to $60.2 million as of December 31, 2012.Although the FHLB is showing signs of financial improvement, the FHLB is still dealing with generally weak demand for wholesale funding, including FHLB advances, and the possibility that further declines in the value of its private-label mortgage-backed securities could cause it to fall below its risk-based capital requirements. Such adverse occurrences could subject our FHLB stock to future impairment charges. See discussion in MD&A and Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements related to the impairment analysis of our FHLB stock as of December 31, 2012.The requirement to record certain assets and liabilities at fair value may adversely affect our financial results.We report certain assets, including available-for-sale investment securities, at fair value. Generally, for assets that are reported at fair value we use quoted market prices or valuation models that utilize market data inputs to estimate fair value. Because we record these assets at their estimated fair value, we may incur losses even if the asset in question presents minimal credit risk. The level of interest rates can impact the estimated fair value of investment securities. Disruptions in the capital markets may require us to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods with respect to investment securities in our portfolio. The amount and timing of any impairment recognized will depend on the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of our investment securities and our estimation of the anticipated recovery period.Changes to the amount and timing of proposed common stock repurchases.The actual amount and timing of future share repurchases, if any, will depend on market and economic conditions, applicable SEC rules, and various other factors. 13Table of Contents"

14,BOH,BANK OF HAWAII CORP,2007-02-22,"RiskFactorsThere are a number of risks and uncertainties thatcould cause our financial results and condition to differ materially fromexpected results.Changes in business and economic conditions, inparticular those of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands (Guam and nearby islands andAmerican Samoa) could lead to lower revenue, lower asset quality, and lowerearnings.Our business and earnings are closely tied to generalbusiness and economic conditions, particularly the economies of Hawaii and thePacific Islands, which are heavily influenced by tourism, government, and otherservice-based industries. Factors that could affect the general economy includegeopolitical risks, such as real or threatened acts of war or terrorism, higherenergy costs, reduced consumer or corporate spending, natural disasters oradverse weather, public health issues, and the normal cyclical nature of theeconomy. A sustained economic downturn could adversely affect the quality ofour assets, credit losses, and the demand for our products and services, whichcould lead to lower revenue and lower earnings.Changes in interestrates could adversely impact our results of operations.Our earnings are highly dependent on the spreadbetween the interest earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and theinterest paid on deposits and borrowings. Changes in market interest ratesimpact the rates earned on loans, leases, and investment securities and therates paid on deposits and borrowings. In addition, changes to market interestrates could impact the level of loans, leases, investment securities, deposits,and borrowings, and the credit profile of existing loans and leases. Interestrates may be affected by many factors beyond our control, including generaleconomic conditions, and the monetary and fiscal policies of variousgovernmental and regulatory authorities. Changes in interest rates maynegatively impact our ability to attract deposits, originate loans and leases,and achieve satisfactory interest rate spreads which could adversely affect ourfinancial condition or results of operations.Our reserve forcredit losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan and lease losses.The risk of nonpayment of loans and leases is inherentin all lending activities, and nonpayment, if it occurs, may have an adverseeffect on our financial condition or results of operation. We maintain areserve for credit losses to absorb estimated probable credit losses inherentin the loan and lease and commitment portfolios as of the balance 7 sheet date. In determining the level of the reservefor credit losses, management makes various assumptions and judgments about theloan and lease portfolio. If our assumptions are incorrect, the reserve forcredit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses, which could adverselyaffect our financial condition or results of operations.Many of our loans are secured by real estate in Hawaiiand Guam. If these locations experience an economic downturn that impacts realestate values and customers ability to repay, loan and lease losses couldexceed the estimates that are currently included in the reserve for creditlosses.Our operations aresubject to extensive regulation.Our operations are subject to extensive regulation byfederal and state governmental authorities. The regulations are primarilyintended to protect depositors, customers and the banking system as a whole. Failureto comply with all applicable regulations could lead to severe penalties anddamage to our reputation. Furthermore, the regulatory environment is constantlyundergoing change and the impact of changes to laws and regulations, theinterpretation of such laws or regulations, or other actions by regulatory agenciescould make regulatory compliance more difficult or expensive for us.Competition mayadversely affect our business.Our future growth and success depends on our abilityto compete effectively. We compete for deposits, loans, leases, and otherfinancial services with a variety of competitors, including banks, thrifts,credit unions, mortgage companies, broker dealers, and insurance companies allof which may be based in or out of Hawaii and the Pacific Islands. Thefinancial services industry is also likely to become more competitive asfurther technological advances enable more companies to provide financialservices. Failures to effectively compete, innovate, and make effective use ofavailable channels to deliver our products and services could adversely affectour financial condition or results of operations.Our liquidity isdependent on dividends from the Bank.The Banks ability to pay dividends to the Parent islimited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon thefinancial condition of the Bank and other factors that the Federal ReserveBoard could assert that payment of dividends from the Bank to Parent would bean unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the Bank was unable to paydividends to the Parent, dividends on our common stock which we pay toshareholders could be adversely affected. Failure to pay dividends or areduction in the dividend rate could have a material adverse effect on themarket price of our common stock.An interruption orbreach in security of our information systems may result in a loss ofcustomers.We rely heavily on communications and informationsystems to conduct our business. In addition, we rely on third parties toprovide key components of our infrastructure, including loan, deposit and generalledger processing, internet connections, and network access. Any disruption inservice of these key components could adversely affect our ability to deliverproducts and services to our customers and otherwise to conduct our operations.Furthermore, any security breach of our information systems or data, whethermanaged by us or by third parties, could harm our reputation or cause adecrease in the number of customers that choose to do business with us.Reputational andlegal risk.Reputational harm could result from our actual oralleged conduct in a variety of areas, including legal and regulatorycompliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, ethicalissues, or inadequate protection of customer information. We use significantresources to comply with our various regulatory requirements, includingthe requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, and any failure to complycould result in reputational harm or significant legal or remediation costs. Damageto our reputation could adversely affect our ability to retain and attract newcustomers. In addition, new litigation or changes in existing litigation,claims and assessments, environmental liabilities and costs involved inresolving or defending against any such matters could have a negative effect onour financial condition or results of operations.8 Changes in accounting standards or in income tax lawsor interpretations could materially affect our financial condition or resultsof operations.Our accounting policies and methods are fundamental tohow we report our financial condition and results of operations. Some of thesepolicies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value ofour assets, liabilities, and financial results. Periodically, new accounting standardsare issued or revisions made to existing standards that may change the methodsgoverning the preparation of our financial statements. Similarly, new taxlegislation could be enacted or interpretations of existing tax laws couldchange causing an adverse effect to our financial condition or results ofoperations.Our performance depends on attracting and retainingkey employees and skilled personnel to operate our business effectively.There are a limited number of qualified personnel inthe markets we serve, so our success depends in part on the continued servicesof many of our current management and other key employees. Hawaiis current lowunemployment rate also contributes to the difficulty of attracting andretaining qualified employees at all management and staffing levels. Failure tomaintain our key employees and maintain adequate staffing of qualifiedpersonnel could adversely impact our operations and our ability to compete"
