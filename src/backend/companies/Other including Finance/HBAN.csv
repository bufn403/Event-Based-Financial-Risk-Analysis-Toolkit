13,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2024-02-16,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
  The risks and uncertainties listed below present risks that could have a material impact on Huntington’s financial condition, the results of operations, or its business. Some of these risks and uncertainties are interrelated and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones Huntington faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Huntington or that Huntington believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. Additionally refer to factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.” For more information on how we manage risks, see discussion in the “Risk Governance” section of our MD&A. In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.Credit Risks:Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $2.4 billion at December 31, 2023, represented management’s estimate of the current expected losses in our loan and lease portfolio (ALLL) as well as our unfunded lending commitments (AULC). We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider probability of default, loss given default, and exposure at default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term of the credit exposure. The economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover lifetime losses of the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Continued economic uncertainty and a recessionary or stagnant economy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions, including persistent inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain issues or labor shortages, which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally, and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us;•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us; and•An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.2023 Form 10-K     27Table of ContentsA U.S. government debt default would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance, including a decrease in the value of Treasury bonds and other government securities held by us, which could negatively impact the Bank’s capital position and its ability to meet regulatory requirements. Other negative impacts of a U.S. government debt default, budget deficit concerns, government shutdown, or related credit ratings downgrades could include volatile capital markets, an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar, as well as increased default rates among borrowers in light of increased economic uncertainty. Some of these impacts might occur even in the absence of an actual default or government shutdown as a consequence of extended political negotiations around the threat of such a default or government shutdown.Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. In addition, the Federal Reserve’s monetary policies, including changes in the federal funds rate and increasing or reducing the size of its balance sheet, may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment. A decline in interest rates could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits. Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios. For more information, refer to “Market Risk” section of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are sensitive to rising and falling rates. Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease, and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase, and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise.In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client-based transactions. 28     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsInflation could negatively impact our business, our profitability, and our stock price.Prolonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention. Additionally, inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and clients’ purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease our appetite for new credit extensions. These inflationary pressures could result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing our stock price to suffer.Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits. In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Technological advances have made it possible for our non-bank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including mobile payments, online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing, and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence where their customers are located. Legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector. For example, the Economic Growth Act and the Tailoring Rules reduce the regulatory burden of certain large BHCs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large BHCs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, electronic platforms, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin. For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1: Business.Liquidity Risks:Changes in Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry, or changes in interest rates, could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers. The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general, and us in particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g., changes in FDIC insurance, liquidity requirements, etc.), changes in the financial condition of Huntington, other banks, or the banking industry in general, changes in the interest rates our competitors pay on their deposits, and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market-related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.2023 Form 10-K     29Table of ContentsWe are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds. Huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of our operations, and Huntington depends upon dividends from the Bank to service Huntington’s debt and to pay dividends to Huntington’s shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to Huntington by the Bank. In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary’s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries. In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock. Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Preferred and Common Stock. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources can include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank. Our ability to access the capital markets, if needed, will depend on a number of factors, including the state of the financial markets. Rising interest rates, disruptions in financial markets, negative perceptions of our business or our financial strength, negative perceptions of the overall banking industry or of other regional banks, or other factors may impact our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, on terms acceptable to us. For example, in the event of future turmoil in the banking industry or other idiosyncratic events, there is no guarantee that the U.S. government will invoke the systemic risk exception, create additional liquidity programs, or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity. Any diminished ability to access short-term funding or capital markets to raise additional capital, if needed, could subject us to liability, restrict our ability to grow, require us to take actions that would affect our earnings negatively or otherwise adversely affect our business and our ability to implement our business plan, capital plan and strategic goals.A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate Huntington and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of Huntington or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.30     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsInstability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The macroeconomic environment in the U.S. is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets. For example, global conflicts (including the continuing conflicts involving Ukraine and the Russian Federation and those in the Middle East) or other similar events, as well as government actions of other restrictions in connection with such events, and trade negotiations between the U.S. and other nations could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the Company and its clients and counterparties. In addition, global supply chain disruptions may cause prolonged inflation, adversely impact consumer and business confidence, and adversely affect the economy as well as our financial condition and results.Operational Risks:Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include: sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist attacks. Additional events beyond our control that could impact our business directly or indirectly include natural disasters such as earthquakes and weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods. Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of these events can be predicted, and the frequency and severity of weather events may be impacted by climate changes. In addition, we may need to take our systems off-line if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring, and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.2023 Form 10-K     31Table of ContentsWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.We, our customers, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ network access or business operations. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences for us.Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Due to increasing geopolitical tensions, nation state cyber-attacks and ransomware are both increasing in sophistication and prevalence. Targeted social engineering and email attacks (i.e., “spear phishing” attacks) are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. The speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited often before security patches are published continues to rise. Remote work further increases the risk that we may experience cyber incidents as a result of our employees, vendors, and other third parties with which we interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments. 32     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsThe risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. Further, our ability to monitor our vendors’ cybersecurity practices is limited. Although we generally have agreements relating to cybersecurity and data privacy in place with our vendors, we cannot guarantee that such agreements will prevent a cyber-incident impacting our systems or information or enable us to obtain adequate or any reimbursement from our service providers in the event we should suffer any such incidents. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cyber-incidents attributed to our vendors as they relate to the information we share with them.We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the customers, clients, and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or expand our business.Cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including: loss of customers and business opportunities; costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; or damage to our or our customers’ and/or third parties’ computers or systems. The occurrence of any of these events could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.For more information regarding the Company’s process for assessing, identifying, and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats, refer to Item 1C: Cybersecurity.Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.As cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations that would enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including us and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Laws in all 50 states generally require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data under certain circumstances. For more information regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”2023 Form 10-K     33Table of ContentsWe receive, maintain, and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of these types of information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information and personal financial information that is collected and handled. For example, under California state law, the CCPA broadly defines personal information and substantially increases the rights of California residents to understand how their personal information is collected, used, and otherwise processed by commercial businesses, such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information. Numerous other states have also enacted or are in the process of enacting state-level privacy, data protection and/or data security laws and regulations. For more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”Further, we make public statements about our use, collection, disclosure, and other processing of personal information through our privacy policies, information provided on our website and press statements. Although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about privacy, data protection, and data security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer, or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted, or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies, or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results.We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures. Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers. There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack. These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products, and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions. Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the U.S. Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire. These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions. Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests. Additionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction. 34     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating expected lifetime credit losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process). Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, inaccurate data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.All models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information. In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information are insufficient.We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure. We rely on third-party service providers, both domestically and offshore, to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. The Risk Oversight Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships. Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships. Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses. 2023 Form 10-K     35Table of ContentsChanges in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. For further discussion, see Note 2 - “Accounting Standards Update” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.Our goodwill could become impaired in the future. If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington, adversely impacting Huntington liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt. Assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation include earnings projections, the discount rates used in the income approach to measure fair value, and observed peer multiples used in estimating the fair value under the market approach. We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank’s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, which in turn could impact our ability to pay dividends. At December 31, 2023, the book value of our goodwill was $5.6 billion, substantially all of which was recorded at the Bank. Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce Huntington’s earnings, as well. Climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations, businesses, and customers. There is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Under medium or longer-term scenarios, such events, if uninterrupted or unaddressed, could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market initiatives. Transition risks, including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations or taxes, could increase our expenses and undermine our strategies. In addition, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our customers’ involvement, in certain industries or projects, in the absence of mitigation and/or transition measures, associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have established a formal climate risk program to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management processes across all established risk pillars, such as market, credit, and operational risks. While the timing and severity of climate change may not be entirely predictable and our risk management processes may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure, we continue to build capabilities to identify, assess, and manage climate risks.36     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsCompliance Risks:We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.The banking industry is highly regulated. We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, CFPB, FDIC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole - not to protect shareholders. These laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters,” among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividend or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Such regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base, and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules, and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.Under the supervision of the CFPB, our Consumer and Business Banking products and services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. Also, federal and state regulators have been increasingly focused on sales practices of branch personnel, including taking regulatory action against other financial institutions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, increase the cost of collection, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject may increase in times of  financial crisis, as well as a result of other factors such as technological and market changes. Compliance with these laws and regulations have resulted in and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations, especially those that apply to our consumer operations, which has been an area of heightened focus, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results.2023 Form 10-K     37Table of ContentsWe expect the current administration will continue to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the former administration. This reform agenda could include a heightened focus on consumer protection, fair lending, the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change, heightened scrutiny on Bank Secrecy Act and AML requirements, topics related to social equity, executive compensation, and increased capital and liquidity, as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends. In addition, mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny. We also expect reform proposals for the short-term wholesale markets. The evolving regulatory and supervisory environment and uncertainty about the timing and scope of future laws, regulations and policies may contribute to decisions we may make to suspend, reduce, or withdraw from existing businesses, activities, or initiatives, which may result in potential lost revenue or significant restructuring or related costs or exposures.In addition, regulatory responses in connection with severe market downturns or unforeseen stress events may alter or disrupt our planned future strategies and actions. Adverse developments affecting the overall strength and soundness of other financial institutions, the financial services industry as a whole, and the general economic climate and U.S. Treasury market could have a negative impact on perceptions about the strength and soundness of our business even if we are not subject to the same adverse developments. During 2023, the FDIC took control and was appointed receiver of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank, and First Republic Bank, respectively. The failure of other banks and financial institutions and the measures taken by governments and regulators in response to these events could adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.For more information on litigation risks, see Note 22 - “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss. The Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the U.S. Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.For more information regarding the Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act, anti-money laundering requirements and OFAC-administered sanctions, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”38     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsStrategic Risk:We operate in a highly competitive industry which depends on our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. We are subject to intense competition from both other financial institutions and from non-bank entities, including FinTech companies. Technology has lowered the barriers to entry, with customers having a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, including crowdfunding, digital wallets, and money transfer services. The continuous widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and mobile applications, and advanced ATM functionality, is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Our “People-First, Digitally-Powered” strategic plan considers the implications of these changes in technology. Additionally, these changes require us to adapt our product and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and customer preferences. Failure to address competitive pressures could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan as well as adapt existing products and services and develop competitive new products and services demanded by our customers. The widespread adoption of technologies will continue to require substantial investments to modify or adapt existing products and services and to develop new product or services. Additionally, we may not be successful in executing our strategic plan, introducing new products or services, achieving market acceptance of new product or services, anticipating or reacting to customers changing preferences, or attracting and retaining loyal customers.We depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers CCAR, a periodic forward-looking quantitative assessment of Huntington’s capital adequacy and planned capital distributions and a review of the strength of Huntington’s practices to assess capital needs. The Federal Reserve makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio after making all capital actions included in Huntington’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. The CCAR process is also used to determine Huntington’s SCB requirement. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to our capital plans, planned capital actions, or stress test results, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases. 2023 Form 10-K     39Table of ContentsWe are also required to maintain minimum capital ratios and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that Huntington and/or the Bank, based on size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain capital ratios above these minimums in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. In the event we are required to raise capital to maintain required minimum capital and leverage ratios or ratios above the required applicable minimums, we may be forced to do so when market conditions are undesirable or on terms that are less favorable to us than we would otherwise require. Furthermore, in order to prevent becoming subject to restrictions on our ability to distribute capital or make certain discretionary bonus payments to management, the Bank must maintain a CCB of 2.5%, and Huntington must maintain the applicable SCB determined as part of the CCAR process, which are in addition to our required minimum capital ratios.We also face the risk of becoming subject to new or more stringent requirements in connection with the introduction of new regulations or modification of existing regulations, which could require us to hold more capital or liquidity or have other adverse effects on our businesses or profitability. For example, proposed changes to applicable capital and liquidity requirements, such as the Basel III Endgame Proposal and the long-term debt proposal, could result in increased expenses or cost of funding, which could negatively affect our financial results or our ability to pay dividends and engage in share repurchases.For more information regarding CCAR, stress testing, and capital and liquidity requirements, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”Reputation Risk:Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and employees is affected by our reputation. Significant harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including officer, director, or employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, security breaches, litigation or regulatory outcomes, compensation practices, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of personal, proprietary or confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, perception of our environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures, and the activities of our clients, customers, and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation indirectly by association. In addition, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media, whether or not factually correct, may affect our business prospects. All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation, and financial condition"
6,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2023-02-17,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
  The risks and uncertainties listed below present risks that could have a material impact on Huntington’s financial condition, the results of operations or its business. Some of these risks and uncertainties are interrelated and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones Huntington faces. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Huntington or that Huntington believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business. Additionally refer to factors set forth under the caption “Forward-Looking Statements.” For more information on how we manage risks, see discussion in the “Risk Governance” section of our MD&A. In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.Credit Risks:Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $2.3 billion at December 31, 2022, represented management’s estimate of the current expected losses in our loan and lease portfolio (ALLL) as well as our unfunded lending commitments (AULC). We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term of the credit exposure. The economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover lifetime losses of the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Continued economic uncertainty and a recessionary or stagnant economy could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions, including persistent inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain issues or labor shortages, which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.•An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.26     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsA U.S. government debt default would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance, including a decrease in the value of Treasury bonds and other government securities held by us, which could negatively impact the Bank’s capital position and its ability to meet regulatory requirements. Other negative impacts could be volatile capital markets, an adverse impact on the U.S. economy and the U.S. dollar, as well as increased default rates among borrowers in light of increased economic uncertainty. Some of these impacts might occur even in the absence of an actual default but as a consequence of extended political negotiations around the threat of such a default and a government shutdown.Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. In addition, decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or reduce the size of its balance sheet or to engage in tapering its purchase of assets may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment. A decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits. Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments. For more information, refer to “Market Risk” of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are sensitive to rising and falling rates. Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease, and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase, and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise.In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client-based transactions. 2022 Form 10-K     27Table of ContentsInflation could negatively impact our business, our profitability, and our stock price.Prolonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses, including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention. Additionally, inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and clients’ purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services. If significant inflation continues, our business could be negatively affected by, among other things, increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease our appetite for new credit extensions. These inflationary pressures could result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing our stock price to suffer.Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits. In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Technological advances have made it possible for our non-bank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including mobile payments, online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing, and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence where their customers are located. Legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector. For example, the Economic Growth Act and the Tailoring Rules reduce the regulatory burden of certain large BHCs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large BHCs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, electronic platforms, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin. For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1: Business.The transition away from LIBOR may adversely affect our business.Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks. The publication of most LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2021, while certain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors are expected to continue to be published until June 30, 2023. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has begun and will continue over the course of the next few years. These reforms may cause such rates to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. A group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), has selected SOFR as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish SOFR in April 2018. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the ARRC due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. In January of 2020, Huntington was added as an ARRC member. The passage of the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act by Congress, and the Federal Reserve’s implementing rule, should decrease the risk of contracts that are not remediated prior to the cessation deadline by providing the terms for a transition to SOFR.28     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsThe market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:•Adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of Huntington’s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include certain variable rate loans, Huntington’s Series B preferred stock, certain of Huntington’s junior subordinated debentures, certain of the Bank’s senior notes and certain other securities or financial arrangements;•Adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR’s role in determining market interest rates globally;•Prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of Huntington’s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and•Result in disputes, litigation, or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts and securities.Huntington implemented a LIBOR transition plan in 2018. As of December 31, 2021, the company ceased issuance of new LIBOR loans. Alternative reference rates at this time are predominantly SOFR-based. Systems, products, and analytics have been effectively transitioned away from LIBOR and are utilizing alternative reference rates. Remaining LIBOR transition project activities include remediation of remaining LIBOR products, including acquired products from TCF by June of 2023. We continue to assess the impact on our customers, with any needed LIBOR exceptions escalated to ELT for approval. The manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan, and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.Liquidity Risks:Changes in Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry, or changes in interest rates, could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers. The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g., changes in FDIC insurance, liquidity requirements, etc.), changes in the financial condition of Huntington, other banks, or the banking industry in general, changes in the interest rates our competitors pay on their deposits, and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market-related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.We are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds. Huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of our operations, and Huntington depends upon dividends from the Bank to service Huntington’s debt and to pay dividends to Huntington’s shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to Huntington by the Bank. In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary’s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries. In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock. Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Preferred and Common Stock. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.2022 Form 10-K     29Table of ContentsIf we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources can include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate Huntington and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of Huntington or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.Instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters, as well as volatility in financial markets, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The macroeconomic environment in the United States is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets. For example, trade negotiations between the U.S. and other nations remain uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the Company and its clients and counterparties. In addition, global demand for products may exceed supply during the economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and such shortages may cause prolonged inflation, adversely impact consumer and business confidence, and adversely affect the economy as well as our financial condition and results.30     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsOperational Risks:Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include: sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist attacks. Additional events beyond our control that could impact our business directly or indirectly include natural disasters such as earthquakes and weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods. Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of these events can be predicted, and the frequency and severity of weather events may be impacted by climate changes. In addition, we may need to take our systems off-line if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring, and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.2022 Form 10-K     31Table of ContentsWe, our customers, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ network access or business operations. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences for us.Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Due to increasing geopolitical tensions, nation state cyber-attacks and ransomware are both increasing in sophistication and prevalence. Targeted social engineering and email attacks (i.e., “spear phishing” attacks) are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. The speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited often before security patches are published continues to rise. Remote work further increases the risk that we may experience cyber incidents as a result of our employees, vendors, and other third parties with which we interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments. The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. Further, our ability to monitor our vendors’ cybersecurity practices is limited. Although we generally have agreements relating to cybersecurity and data privacy in place with our vendors, we cannot guarantee that such agreements will prevent a cyber-incident impacting our systems or information or enable us to obtain adequate or any reimbursement from our service providers in the event we should suffer any such incidents. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cyber-incidents attributed to our vendors as they relate to the information we share with them.We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the customers, clients, and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or expand our business.32     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsCyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; or damage to our or our customers’ and/or third parties’ computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.As cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations that would enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including us and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data. For more information regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”We receive, maintain, and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of these types of information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information and personal financial information that is collected and handled. For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the CCPA. The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. Numerous other states have also enacted or are in the process of enacting state-level privacy, data protection and/or data security laws and regulations. For more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”Further, we make public statements about our use, collection, disclosure, and other processing of personal information through our privacy policies, information provided on our website and press statements. Although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about privacy, data protection, and data security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair, or misrepresentative of our actual practices.We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer, or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted, or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies, or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results.2022 Form 10-K     33Table of ContentsWe face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures. Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers. There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack. These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products, and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions. Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire. These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions. Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests. Additionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating expected lifetime credit losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process). Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, inaccurate data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.34     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsAll models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information. In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information are insufficient.We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure. We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships. Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships. Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses. Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. For further discussion, see Note 2 - “Accounting Standards Update” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 2022 Form 10-K     35Table of ContentsImpairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.Our goodwill could become impaired in the future. If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington, adversely impacting Huntington liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt. Assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation include earnings projections, the discount rates used in the income approach to measure fair value, and observed peer multiples used in estimating the fair value under the market approach. We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank’s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings. At December 31, 2022, the book value of our goodwill was $5.6 billion, substantially all of which was recorded at the Bank. Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce Huntington’s earnings, as well. Climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations, businesses, and customers. There is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Under medium or longer-term scenarios, such events, if uninterrupted or unaddressed, could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market initiatives. Transition risks, including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations or taxes, could increase our expenses and undermine our strategies. In addition, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our customers’ involvement, in certain industries or projects, in the absence of mitigation and/or transition measures, associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have established a formal climate risk program to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management processes across all established risk pillars, such as market, credit, and operational risks. While the timing and severity of climate change may not be entirely predictable and our risk management processes may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure, we continue to build capabilities to identify, assess, and manage climate risks.The effects of COVID-19 have adversely impacted our operations and financial performance, and it, or a similar health crisis or pandemic, could have similar adverse impacts in future periods. Although U.S. and global economies have begun to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic, including labor shortages, disruptions of global supply chains, and inflationary pressures, continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and could adversely affect our business. The pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, to recognize credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses should the effects of the pandemic continue for an extended period of time or worsen. Furthermore, the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and our financial assets. Sustained adverse effects may also increase our cost of capital, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, or result in downgrades in our credit ratings. 36     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in heightened operational risks. Many of our colleagues continue to work remotely at least on a part-time basis, which may create additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals have increased their attempts to compromise business emails, including an increase in phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon consumers and businesses during this time. The increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud in certain instances.Compliance Risks:We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.The banking industry is highly regulated. We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, CFPB, FDIC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole - not to protect shareholders. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividend or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Such regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base, and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules, and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject increased in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Compliance with these laws and regulations have resulted in and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations, especially those that apply to our consumer operations, which has been an area of heightened focus, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results.We expect the current administration will continue to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the former administration. This reform agenda could include a heightened focus on consumer protection, fair lending, the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change, heightened scrutiny on Bank Secrecy Act and AML requirements, topics related to social equity, executive compensation, and increased capital and liquidity, as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends. In addition, mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny. We also expect reform proposals for the short-term wholesale markets. It is too early for us to assess the extent to which these policies would be implemented and what their impact on our business will be. 2022 Form 10-K     37Table of ContentsThe resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.For more information on litigation risks, see Note 22 - “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss. The Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.For more information regarding the Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act, anti-money laundering requirements and OFAC-administered sanctions, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”Strategic Risk:We operate in a highly competitive industry which depends on our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. We are subject to intense competition from both other financial institutions and from non-bank entities, including FinTech companies. Technology has lowered the barriers to entry, with customers having a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, including crowdfunding, digital wallets, and money transfer services. The continuous widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and mobile applications, and advanced ATM functionality, is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Our “People-First, Digitally-Powered” strategic plan considers the implications of these changes in technology. Additionally, these changes require us to adapt our product and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and customer preferences. Failure to address competitive pressures could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. 38     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsOur success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan as well as adapt existing products and services and develop competitive new products and services demanded by our customers. The widespread adoption of technologies will continue to require substantial investments to modify or adapt existing products and services and to develop new product or services. Additionally, we may not be successful in executing our strategic plan, introducing new products or services, achieving market acceptance of new product or services, anticipating or reacting to customers changing preferences, or attracting and retaining loyal customers.We depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers CCAR, a periodic forward-looking quantitative assessment of Huntington’s capital adequacy and planned capital distributions and a review of the strength of Huntington’s practices to assess capital needs. The Federal Reserve makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio after making all capital actions included in Huntington’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. The CCAR process is also used to determine Huntington’s SCB requirement. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to our capital plans, planned capital actions, or stress test results, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases. We are also required to maintain minimum capital ratios and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that Huntington and/or the Bank, based on size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain capital ratios above these minimums in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. In the event we are required to raise capital to maintain required minimum capital and leverage ratios or ratios above the required applicable minimums, we may be forced to do so when market conditions are undesirable or on terms that are less favorable to us than we would otherwise require. Furthermore, in order to prevent becoming subject to restrictions on our ability to distribute capital or make certain discretionary bonus payments to management, the Bank must maintain a CCB of 2.5%, and Huntington must maintain the applicable SCB determined as part of the CCAR process, which are in addition to our required minimum capital ratios.For more information regarding CCAR, stress testing, and capital and liquidity requirements, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.”2022 Form 10-K     39Table of ContentsIf our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions. In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends. Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services. We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters.” As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including charging monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.Under the supervision of the CFPB, our Consumer and Business Banking products and services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. Also, federal and state regulators have been increasingly focused on sales practices of branch personnel, including taking regulatory action against other financial institutions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, increase the cost of collection, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.In addition, we are allowed to conduct certain activities that are financial in nature by virtue of Huntington’s status as an FHC, as discussed in more detail in Item 1. Regulatory Matters. If Huntington or the Bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for Huntington to continue to qualify as an FHC, the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as an FHC. If the failure to meet these standards persists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by a BHC but not an FHC.Reputation Risk:Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and employees is affected by our reputation. Significant harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including officer, director, or employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, security breaches, litigation or regulatory outcomes, compensation practices, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of personal, proprietary or confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, perception of our environmental, social, and governance practices and disclosures, and the activities of our clients, customers, and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation indirectly by association. In addition, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media, whether or not factually correct, may affect our business prospects. All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation, and financial condition"
5,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2022-02-18,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
  Risk Factor SummaryOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. While there is no assurance that any lists of risks and uncertainties of risk factors is complete, below is a summary of risk factors which impact our business. This summary should be read in conjunction with the “Detailed Discussion of Risk Pillars and Risk Factors
” immediately following this summary on pages 27 through 43 in this 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks which impact our business include but are not limited to: COVID-19 Related Risk: •The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.Credit Risks:•Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our income and capital. Market Risks: •Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital. •Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.Liquidity Risks:•Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.•If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Operational Risks: •Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm. •We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure. •Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Compliance Risks: •We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us. •Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.26     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contents•Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial lossStrategic Risks: •We operate in a highly competitive industry which depends on our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. •Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.Risks related to the TCF Merger:•We expect to continue to incur substantial costs related to the Merger. •The integration of Huntington and TCF may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and Huntington may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.•Our future results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.Detailed Discussion of Risk Pillars and Risk Factors
Huntington has formalized a holistic risk governance framework in alignment with the size, complexity, and profile of the Company. We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control. Our framework is approved by the ROC of Huntington’s Board of Directors (the Board). Key components include establishing our risk appetite, lines of defense and risk pillars, governance and committee oversight and limit setting and escalation processes. Huntington classifies/aggregates risk into seven risk pillars. Huntington recognizes that risks can be interrelated or embedded within each other, and therefore managing across risk pillars is a key component of the framework. The following defines the Company’s risk pillars.•Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; •Market risk, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital. Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); •Liquidity risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; •Operational risk, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, including information security breaches or cyberattacks, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud, external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management;•Compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions, or other sanctions as a result of non-conformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry;•Strategic risk, which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry / market changes; and  •Reputation risk, which is the risk that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.2021 Form 10-K     27Table of ContentsIn addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.COVID-19 related Risk: The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. Although U.S. and global economies have begun to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased, certain adverse consequences of the pandemic continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and may persist for some time, including labor shortages and disruptions of global supply chains. The growth in economic activity and demand for goods and services, alongside labor shortages and supply chain complications, has also contributed to rising inflationary pressures. The pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, to recognize credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses should the effects of the pandemic continue for an extended period of time or worsen. Furthermore, the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and our financial assets. Sustained adverse effects may also increase our cost of capital, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, or result in downgrades in our credit ratings. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the rate and distribution and administration of vaccines globally, the severity and duration of any resurgence of COVID-19 variants, the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, colleagues, counterparties and service providers, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.Governmental authorities have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth. These measures may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of consumer and commercial loan payments, may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. We also expect that the temporary reduction of interest rates to near zero will, over the course of 2022, be reversed, with the Federal Reserve now signaling its concerns with respect to inflation and announcing that it will begin to taper its purchases of mortgages and other bonds. We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in heightened operational risks. Many of our colleagues have been working remotely, and increased levels of remote access create additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities. Cybercriminals have increased their attempts to compromise business emails, including an increase in phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon consumers and businesses during this time. The increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud in certain instances.The length of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the measures being put in place to address it are unknown. Until the effects of the pandemic subside, there is a risk of reduced revenues in our businesses and increased customer defaults. Furthermore, the U.S. economy experienced a temporary recession as a result of the pandemic, and our business could be materially and adversely affected by another recession should the effects of the pandemic continue for a period of time or worsen. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations, it also has the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We have also participated as a lender in certain government programs designed to provide economic relief in response to the pandemic. We are participating in the SBA’s PPP as an eligible lender, and while these loans to small business clients benefit from a government guaranty, many of these businesses may face difficulties even after being granted such a loan. We also participated in the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program. As a result of participating in these programs, we face increased risks, including credit, fraud risk and litigation.28     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsCredit Risks:Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $2.1 billion at December 31, 2021, represented management’s estimate of the current expected losses in our loan and lease portfolio (ALLL) as well as our unfunded lending commitments (AULC). We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term of the credit exposure. The economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover lifetime losses of the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions, including persistent inflation, supply chain issues or labor shortages, which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. In addition, decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or reduce the size of its balance sheet or to engage in tapering its purchase of assets may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. 2021 Form 10-K     29Table of ContentsChanges in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment. A decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits. Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments. For more information, refer to “Market Risk” of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are sensitive to rising and falling rates. Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise.In response to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%. While interest rates remain low, the Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising interest rates during 2022. We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to the outbreak or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client-based transactions. 30     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsIndustry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits. In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Technological advances have made it possible for our non-bank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including mobile payments, online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing, and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence where their customers are located. Legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector. For example, the Economic Growth Act and the Tailoring Rules reduce the regulatory burden of certain large BHCs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large BHCs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, electronic platforms, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin. For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1: Business.Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks. The publication of most LIBOR rates ceased as of the end of December 2021. While certain U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors are expected to continue to be published until June 30, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies have encouraged banks to cease entering into new contracts referencing LIBOR no later than December 31, 2021. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has begun and will continue over the course of the next few years. These reforms may cause such rates to perform differently than in the past, or to disappear entirely, or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), has selected SOFR as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish SOFR in April 2018. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market. In January of 2020, Huntington was added as an ARRC member. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In particular, any such transition could:•Adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of Huntington’s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include certain variable rate loans, Huntington’s Series B preferred stock, certain of Huntington’s junior subordinated debentures, certain of the Bank’s senior notes and certain other securities or financial arrangements;•Adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR’s role in determining market interest rates globally;•Prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of Huntington’s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and2021 Form 10-K     31Table of Contents•Result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts and securities.Huntington implemented a LIBOR transition plan in 2018. As of December 31, 2021, the company ceased issuance of new LIBOR loans. Alternative reference rates at this time are predominantly SOFR based. Systems, products and analytics have been effectively transitioned away from LIBOR and are utilizing alternative reference rates. Remaining LIBOR transition project activities include remediation of remaining LIBOR products, including recently acquired products from TCF by June of 2023. We continue to assess the impact on our customers, with any needed LIBOR exceptions escalated to ELT for approval. The manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.Liquidity Risks:Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers. The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g., changes in FDIC insurance, liquidity requirements, etc.), changes in the financial condition of Huntington, other banks, or the banking industry in general, changes in the interest rates our competitors pay on their deposits, and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.We are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds. Huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of our operations, and Huntington depends upon dividends from the Bank to service Huntington’s debt and to pay dividends to Huntington’s shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to Huntington by the Bank. In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary’s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries. In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock. Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Preferred and Common Stock. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources can include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.32     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsA reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate Huntington and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of Huntington or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.Operational Risks:Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include: sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist attacks. Additional events beyond our control that could impact our business directly or indirectly include natural disasters such as earthquakes and weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of these events can be predicted, and the frequency and severity of weather events may be impacted by climate changes. In addition, we may need to take our systems off-line if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring, and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.2021 Form 10-K     33Table of ContentsWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.We, our customers, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ network access or business operations. As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences for us.Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Due to increasing geopolitical tensions, nation state cyber-attacks and ransomware are both increasing in sophistication and prevalence. Targeted social engineering and email attacks (i.e. “spear phishing” attacks) are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. The speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited often before security patches are published continues to rise. Remote work further increases the risk that we may experience cyber incidents as a result of our employees, vendors, and other third parties with which we interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments. 34     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsThe risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner. Further, our ability to monitor our vendors’ cybersecurity practices is limited. Although we generally have agreements relating to cybersecurity and data privacy in place with our vendors, we cannot guarantee that such agreements will prevent a cyber-incident impacting our systems or information or enable us to obtain adequate or any reimbursement from our service providers in the event we should suffer any such incidents. Due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations, we may be held responsible for cyber-incidents attributed to our vendors as they relate to the information we share with them.We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the customers, clients, and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or expand our business.Cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; or damage to our or our customers’ and/or third parties’ computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.As cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations that would enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including us and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data. For more information regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.2021 Form 10-K     35Table of ContentsWe receive, maintain, and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of these types of information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information and personal financial information that is collected and handled. For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the CCPA. The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds. Numerous other states have also enacted or are in the process of enacting state-level privacy, data protection and/or data security laws and regulations. For more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.Further, we make public statements about our use, collection, disclosure and other processing of personal information through our privacy policies, information provided on our website and press statements. Although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation, we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so. The publication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about privacy, data protection and data security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive, unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices.We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer, or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted, or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies, or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results.We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures. Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers. There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack. These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products, and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions. Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire. These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions. Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests. Additionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction. 36     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating expected lifetime credit losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process). Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, inaccurate data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.All models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information. In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information are insufficient.We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure. We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships. Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships. Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses. 2021 Form 10-K     37Table of ContentsChanges in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. For further discussion, see Note 2 - “Accounting Standards Update” to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.Our goodwill could become impaired in the future. If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington, adversely impacting Huntington liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt. The most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our Common Stock, projections of earnings, the discount rates used in the income approach to fair value, and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us. We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank’s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings. At December 31, 2021, the book value of our goodwill was $5.3 billion, substantially all of which was recorded at the Bank. Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce Huntington’s earnings, as well. Climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations, businesses and customers. There is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters. The physical risks of climate change include discrete events, such as flooding and wildfires, and longer-term shifts in climate patterns, such as extreme heat, sea level rise, and more frequent and prolonged drought. Under medium or longer-term scenarios, such events, if uninterrupted or unaddressed, could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely, including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility. Additionally, transitioning to a low-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technology and market initiatives. Transition risks, including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations or taxes, could increase our expenses and undermine our strategies. In addition, our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change, including our involvement, or our customers’ involvement, in certain industries or projects, in the absence of mitigation and/or transition measures, associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change. As climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types, we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management strategies established for risks such as market, credit and operational risks; however, because the timing and severity of climate change may not be predictable, our risk management strategies may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure.38     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsCompliance Risks:We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.The banking industry is highly regulated. We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, CFPB, FDIC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole - not to protect shareholders. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividend or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Such regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base, and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules, and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject increased in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Compliance with these laws and regulations have resulted in and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations, especially those that apply to our consumer operations, which has been an area of heightened focus, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results.We expect that the Biden Administration will continue to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the Trump Administration. This reform agenda could include a heightened focus on consumer protection, fair lending, the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change, heightened scrutiny on Bank Secrecy Act and AML requirements, topics related to social equity, executive compensation, and increased capital and liquidity, as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends. In addition, mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny. We also expect reform proposals for the short-term wholesale markets. It is too early for us to assess the extent to which these policies would be implemented and what their impact on our business will be. 2021 Form 10-K     39Table of ContentsThe resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.For more information on litigation risks, see Note 22 - “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss. The Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.For more information regarding the Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act, anti-money laundering requirements and OFAC-administered sanctions, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.Strategic Risk:We operate in a highly competitive industry which depends on our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. We are subject to intense competition from both other financial institutions and from non-bank entities, including FinTech companies. Technology has lowered the barriers to entry, with customers having a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, including crowdfunding, digital wallets and money transfer services. The continuous widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and mobile applications, and advanced ATM functionality, is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Our “People-First, Digitally-Powered” strategic plan considers the implications of these changes in technology. Additionally, these changes require us to adapt our product and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and customer preferences. Failure to address competitive pressures could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. 40     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsOur success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan as well as adapt existing products and services and develop competitive new products and services demanded by our customers. The widespread adoption of technologies will continue to require substantial investments to modify or adapt existing products and services and to develop new product or services. Additionally, we may not be successful in executing our strategic plan, introducing new products or services, achieving market acceptance of new product or services, anticipating or reacting to customers changing preferences or attracting and retaining loyal customers.We depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers CCAR, a periodic forward-looking quantitative assessment of Huntington’s capital adequacy and planned capital distributions and a review of the strength of Huntington’s practices to assess capital needs. The Federal Reserve makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio after making all capital actions included in Huntington’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. The CCAR process is also used to determine Huntington’s stress capital buffer requirement. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to our capital plans, planned capital actions or stress test results, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases. We are also required to maintain minimum capital ratios and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that Huntington and/or the Bank, based on size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain capital ratios above these minimums in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. In the event we are required to raise capital to maintain required minimum capital and leverage ratios or ratios above the required applicable minimums, we may be forced to do so when market conditions are undesirable or on terms that are less favorable to us than we would otherwise require. Furthermore, in order to prevent becoming subject to restrictions on our ability to distribute capital or make certain discretionary bonus payments to management, the Bank must maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%, and Huntington must maintain the applicable stress capital buffer determined as part of the CCAR process, which are in addition to our required minimum capital ratios.For more information regarding CCAR, stress testing, and capital and liquidity requirements, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.2021 Form 10-K     41Table of ContentsIf our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions. In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends. Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services. We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”. As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including charging monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.Under the supervision of the CFPB, our Consumer and Business Banking products and services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. Also, federal and state regulators have been increasingly focused on sales practices of branch personnel, including taking regulatory action against other financial institutions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, increase the cost of collection, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.In addition, we are allowed to conduct certain activities that are financial in nature by virtue of Huntington’s status as an FHC, as discussed in more detail in Item 1. Regulatory Matters. If Huntington or the Bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for Huntington to continue to qualify as an FHC, the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a FHC. If the failure to meet these standards persists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by a BHC but not an FHC.Reputation Risk:Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and employees is affected by our reputation. Significant harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including officer, director or employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, security breaches, litigation or regulatory outcomes, compensation practices, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of personal, proprietary or confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, perception of our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures, and the activities of our clients, customers, and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation indirectly by association. In addition, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media, whether or not factually correct, may affect our business prospects. All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation, and financial condition.42     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsRisks related to the TCF Merger:We expect to continue to incur substantial costs related to the Merger. We have incurred substantial costs in connection with the Merger and subsequent integration of the processes, policies, procedures, operations, and technologies and systems, including purchasing, accounting and finance, payroll, compliance, treasury management, branch operations, vendor management, risk management, lines of business, pricing and benefits. While we have attempted to accurately forecast these costs, factors that are beyond our control or that we have failed to accurately estimate could result in us incurring future charges in excess of our current estimates. These charges could be material and could materially adversely affect our future earnings.The integration of Huntington and TCF may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and Huntington may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities and cost savings from combining the businesses of Huntington and TCF. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the Merger, we must successfully integrate and combine the businesses of Huntington and TCF in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, or if we have failed to accurately estimate the anticipated benefits of the Merger, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, they may take longer to realize than expected, and we may incur additional unforeseen expenses. The integration process could result in the loss of key employees, diversion of management attention and resources, the disruption of the combined company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the combined company’s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees. In addition, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may make it more costly or more difficult to integrate our new customers and employees, which, in turn, may make it more difficult to realize anticipated synergies or cost savings in the amounts estimated, in the timeframe contemplated, or at all. Our future results may suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations. As a result of the Merger, the size, scope, and complexity of our business has increased significantly beyond that of either Huntington’s or TCF’s business prior to the Merger. Our future success will depend, in part, upon our ability to manage and achieve the benefits we have anticipated will be associated with this expanded business, challenges, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and the associated increased costs and complexity. We may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of our business. There can be no assurances that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, growth opportunities, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated"

  Risk Factor SummaryOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties.  While there is no assurance that any lists of risks and uncertainties of risk factors is complete, below is a summary of risk factors which impact our business.  This summary should be read in conjunction with the “Detailed Discussion of Risk Pillars and Risk Factors
” immediately following this summary on pages 25 through 43 in this 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Risks which impact our business include but are not limited to: COVID-19 related Risk: •The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.Credit Risks:•Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our income and capital. Market Risks: •Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital. •Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.Liquidity Risks:•Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.•If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Operational Risks: •Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm. •We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure. •Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Compliance Risks: •We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us. •Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.2020 Form 10-K     24Table of Contents•Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial lossStrategic Risks: •We operate in a highly competitive industry which depends on our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences.  •Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity.

Detailed Discussion of Risk Pillars and Risk Factors
Huntington has formalized a holistic risk governance framework in alignment with the size, complexity, and profile of the Company.  We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control.  Our framework is approved by the ROC of Huntington’s Board of Directors (the Board).  Key components include establishing our risk appetite, lines of defense and risk pillars, governance and committee oversight and limit setting and escalation processes.  Huntington classifies/aggregates risk into seven risk pillars.  Huntington recognizes that risks can be interrelated or embedded within each other, and therefore managing across risk pillars is a key component of the framework.  The following defines the Company’s risk pillars.•Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; •Market risk, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital.  Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); •Liquidity risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due.  Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels.  Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; •Operational risk, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, including information security breaches or cyberattacks, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events.  Operational losses result from internal fraud, external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management;•Compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions, or other sanctions as a result of non-conformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry;•Strategic risk, which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry / market changes; and  25     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contents•Reputation risk, which is the risk that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.COVID-19 related Risk: The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the U.S. and global economy; disrupted U.S. and global supply chains; created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets; contributed to a decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities; resulted in ratings downgrades, credit deterioration, and defaults in many industries; increased demands on capital and liquidity; and increased unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence.  In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities, including those in our footprint.  The pandemic has caused us, and could continue to cause us, to recognize credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses.  Furthermore, the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and our financial assets.  Sustained adverse effects may also increase our cost of capital, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, or result in downgrades in our credit ratings.  The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the continued effectiveness of our business continuity plan, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our customers, colleagues, counterparties and service providers, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.Governmental authorities have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets, and support economic growth.  The success of these measures is unknown, and they may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the pandemic.  Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of consumer and commercial loan payments and the reduction in interest rates to near zero, may have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.  We also face an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions.  The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in heightened operational risks.  Many of our colleagues have been working remotely, and increased levels of remote access create additional cybersecurity risk and opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.  Cybercriminals may increase their attempts to compromise business emails, including an increase in phishing attempts, and fraudulent vendors or other parties may view the pandemic as an opportunity to prey upon consumers and businesses during this time. The increase in online and remote banking activities may also increase the risk of fraud in certain instances.The length of the pandemic and the effectiveness of the measures being put in place to address it are unknown.  Until the effects of the pandemic subside, we expect continued draws on lines of credit, reduced revenues in our businesses, and increased customer defaults.  Furthermore, the U.S. economy is experiencing a recession as a result of the pandemic, and our business could be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession.  To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, liquidity, or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We have also participated as a lender in certain government programs designed to provide economic relief in response to the pandemic.  We are participating in the SBA’s PPP as an eligible lender, and while these loans to small business clients benefit from a government guaranty, many of these businesses may face difficulties even after being granted such a loan.  We also participated in the Federal Reserve’s Main Street Lending Program.  As a result of participating in these programs, we face increased risks, including credit, fraud risk and litigation.2020 Form 10-K     26Table of ContentsCredit Risks:Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital.Effective January 1, 2020, Huntington adopted ASU 2016-13 Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (ASC Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.  Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, Huntington implemented new credit loss models within our loan and lease portfolio which incorporated historical loss experience, as well as current and future economic conditions over a reasonable and supportable period beyond the balance sheet date.  The models materially affected how we determine our ACL and report our financial condition and results of operations.  For further discussion, see Note 2 “Accounting Standards Update” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers.  Our ACL of $1.9 billion at December 31, 2020, represented management’s estimate of the current expected losses in our loan and lease portfolio (ALLL) as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC).  We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness.  In doing so, we consider probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term of the credit exposure.  The economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts.  There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover lifetime losses of the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets.  If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties.  These conditions could result in one or more of the following:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.  The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets.  This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings).  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions.  Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates.  In addition, decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or reduce the size of its balance sheet may also affect 27     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contentsinterest rates.  If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted.  Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.  Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage servicing rights.  An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income.  However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income.  In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  A decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits.  Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities.  Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio.  Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios.  In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments.  For more information, refer to “Market Risk” of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are sensitive to rising and falling rates.  Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase.  Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease.  In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments.  Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise.In response to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve lowered its target for the federal funds rate to a range of 0% to 0.25%.  Such low rates increase the risk in the U.S. of a negative interest rate environment in which interest rates drop below zero, either broadly or for some types of instruments.  For example, yields on one-month and three-month Treasuries briefly dropped below zero in March 2020.  Such an occurrence would likely further reduce the interest we earn on loans and other earning assets, while also likely requiring us to pay more to maintain our deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank.  Although, we have evaluated our systems and have made appropriate changes, our systems may not be able to adequately handle a negative interest rate environment and not all variable rate instruments are designed for such a circumstance.  We cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary policies in response to the outbreak or the precise effects that they may have on our activities and financial results.In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client-based transactions.  Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify.  Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits.  In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services.  Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business.  Technological advances have made it possible for our non-bank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including mobile payments, online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing, and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence 2020 Form 10-K     28Table of Contentswhere their customers are located.  Legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector.  For example, the Economic Growth Act and the Tailoring Rules reduce the regulatory burden of certain large BHCs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large BHCs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion.  Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, electronic platforms, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products.  If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected.  In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin.  For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1: Business.Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.LIBOR and certain other interest rate “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform.  These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.  On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, announced it will consult on its intention to cease the publication of one-week and two-month tenors of USD LIBOR after December 31, 2021, while all remaining tenors of USD LIBOR would continue to be published until June 30, 2023.  Therefore, it is expected that publication of all USD LIBORs will cease to exist after June 30, 2023.  In parallel, the Federal Reserve, OCC and FDIC issued guidance encouraging banks to transition away from USD LIBOR as soon as practicable.  The statement suggested that banks should not enter into new transactions referencing USD LIBOR after December 31, 2021.  While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), has selected SOFR as its recommended alternative to LIBOR.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish SOFR in April 2018.  SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market.  At this time, it is impossible to predict whether SOFR will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. In January of 2020, Huntington was added as an ARRC member. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In particular, any such transition could:•Adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of Huntington’s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include certain variable rate loans, Huntington’s Series B preferred stock, certain of Huntington’s junior subordinated debentures, certain of the Bank’s senior notes and certain other securities or financial arrangements;•Adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR’s role in determining market interest rates globally;•Prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of Huntington’s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and•Result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts and securities.The transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition Huntington’s risk management and other processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate, such as SOFR.  Huntington has developed a LIBOR transition team and project plan that outlines timelines and priorities to prepare its processes, systems and people to support this transition.  Timelines and priorities include assessing the impact on our customers, as well as assessing system requirements for operational processes.  There can be no guarantee that these efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.29     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsThe manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.Liquidity Risks:Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost.  The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers.  The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular.  The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g., changes in FDIC insurance, liquidity requirements, etc.), changes in the financial condition of Huntington, other banks, or the banking industry in general, changes in the interest rates our competitors pay on their deposits, and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits.  While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.We are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds.  Huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank.  The Bank conducts most of our operations, and Huntington depends upon dividends from the Bank to service Huntington’s debt and to pay dividends to Huntington’s shareholders.  The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations.  It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to Huntington by the Bank.  In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary’s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries.  In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock.  Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Preferred and Common Stock.  Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources can include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt.  The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets.  We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank.  The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.  We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.2020 Form 10-K     30Table of ContentsA reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate Huntington and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies.  There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings.  A downgrade of the credit ratings of Huntington or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities.  This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.Operational Risks:Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions.  Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance.  We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk.  For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely.  Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services.  Such events may include: sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist attacks.  Additional events beyond our control that could impact our business directly or indirectly include natural disasters such as earthquakes and weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes and floods.  Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of these events can be predicted, and the frequency and severity of weather events may be impacted by climate changes.  In addition, we may need to take our systems off-line if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack.  In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data.  In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems.  We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.  This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions.  Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring, and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs.  Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.  In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.31     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsWe face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft.  Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties.  In addition, to access our network, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.We, our customers, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks.  These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ network access or business operations.  As cyber-threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents.  Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences for us.Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions.  For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.  In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage.  Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise.  Due to increasing geopolitical tensions, nation state cyber attacks and ransomware are both increasing in sophistication and prevalence.  Targeted social engineering and email attacks (i.e. “spear phishing” attacks) are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent.  In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.  Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive.  The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred.  The speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited often before security patches are published continues to rise.  The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years.  Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the customers, clients, and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power.  As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us.  This consolidation, interconnectivity, 2020 Form 10-K     32Table of Contentsand complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.  Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or expand our business.Cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences.  Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business.  Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm.  A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; or damage to our or our customers’ and/or third parties’ computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.As cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus.  The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations that would enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including us and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness.  Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data.  For more information regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.We receive, maintain, and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information.  The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of these types of information are governed by federal and state law.  Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information and personal financial information that is collected and handled.  For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the CCPA.  The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds.  For more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain.  We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies.  If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer, or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted, or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies, or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results.33     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsWe face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures.  Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers.  There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack.  These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products, and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities.  Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions.  Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire.  These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions.  Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests.  Additionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values.  Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction.  Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud.  We are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures.  Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments.  Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating expected lifetime credit losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process).  Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations.  These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant.  Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution.  Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, inaccurate data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.All models have certain limitations.  Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information.  In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have 2020 Form 10-K     34Table of Contentssufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate.  If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions.  Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable.  Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses.  Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information are insufficient.We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.  We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs.  Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities.  When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility.  The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships.  Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships.  Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.  Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business.  While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business.  Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses.  Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements.  Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied.  For further discussion, see Note 2 - “Accounting Standards Update” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.Our goodwill could become impaired in the future.  If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington, adversely impacting Huntington liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt.  The most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our Common Stock, projections of earnings, the discount rates used in the income approach to fair value, and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present.  If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.  If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank’s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings.  At December 31, 2020, the book value of our goodwill was $2.0 billion, substantially all of which was recorded at the Bank.  Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce Huntington’s earnings, as well.  35     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsCompliance Risks:We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.The banking industry is highly regulated.  We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, CFPB, FDIC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies.  The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole - not to protect shareholders.  These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividend or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs.  Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes.  Such regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.  Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base, and the price of our securities.  Further, any new laws, rules, and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject increased in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes.  Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector.  Compliance with these laws and regulations have resulted in and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations, especially those that apply to our consumer operations, which has been an area of heightened focus, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results.We expect that the Biden Administration will seek to implement a regulatory reform agenda that is significantly different than that of the Trump Administration.  This reform agenda could include a heightened focus on fair lending, the regulation of loan portfolios and credit concentrations to borrowers impacted by climate change, heightened scrutiny on Bank Secrecy Act and AML requirements, topics related to social equity, executive compensation, and increased capital and liquidity, as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends.  In addition, mergers and acquisitions could be dampened by increased antitrust scrutiny.  We also expect reform proposals for the short-term wholesale markets.  It is too early for us to assess which, if any of these policies, would be implemented and what their impact on our business would be.  2020 Form 10-K     36Table of ContentsThe resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high.  Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.For more information on litigation risks, see Note 23 - “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss.  The Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.  The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.  FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC.  If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.For more information regarding the Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act, anti-money laundering requirements and OFAC-administered sanctions, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.Strategic Risk:We operate in a highly competitive industry which depends on our ability to successfully execute our strategic plan and adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer preferences. We are subject to intense competition from both other financial institutions and from non-bank entities, including FinTech companies.  Technology has lowered the barriers to entry, with customers having a growing variety of traditional and nontraditional alternatives, including crowdfunding, digital wallets and money transfer services.  The continuous widespread adoption of new technologies, including internet services and mobile applications, and advanced ATM functionality, is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services.  Our “People-First, Digitally-Powered” strategic plan considers the implications of these changes in technology.  Additionally, these changes require us to adapt our product and services, as well as our distribution of them, to evolving industry standards and customer preferences. Failure to address competitive pressures could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to successfully implement our strategic plan as well as adapt existing products and services and develop competitive new products and services demanded by our customers.  The widespread adoption of technologies will continue to require substantial investments to modify or adapt existing products and services and to develop new product or services.  Additionally, we may not be successful in executing 37     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contentsour strategic plan, introducing new products or services, achieving market acceptance of new product or services, anticipating or reacting to customers changing preferences or attracting and retaining loyal customers.We depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel.  The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected.  Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel.  We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate.  Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve.  The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations.  The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity.  Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers CCAR, a periodic forward-looking quantitative assessment of Huntington’s capital adequacy and planned capital distributions and a review of the strength of Huntington’s practices to assess capital needs.  The Federal Reserve makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio after making all capital actions included in Huntington’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon.  The CCAR process is also used to determine Huntington’s stress capital buffer requirement.  There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to our capital plans, planned capital actions or stress test results, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases.  We are also required to maintain minimum capital ratios and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that Huntington and/or the Bank, based on size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain capital ratios above these minimums in order to operate in a safe and sound manner.  In the event we are required to raise capital to maintain required minimum capital and leverage ratios or ratios above the required applicable minimums, we may be forced to do so when market conditions are undesirable or on terms that are less favorable to us than we would otherwise require.  Furthermore, in order to prevent becoming subject to restrictions on our ability to distribute capital or make certain discretionary bonus payments to management, the Bank must maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer of 2.5%, and Huntington must maintain the applicable stress capital buffer determined as part of the CCAR process, which are in addition to our required minimum capital ratios.For more information regarding CCAR, stress testing, and capital and liquidity requirements, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions.  In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends.  Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services.  We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies.  As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.  As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization.  Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including charging monetary fines, 2020 Form 10-K     38Table of Contentsimpacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.Under the supervision of the CFPB, our Consumer and Business Banking products and services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations.  We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions.  Also, federal and state regulators have been increasingly focused on sales practices of branch personnel, including taking regulatory action against other financial institutions.  In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, increase the cost of collection, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.In addition, we are allowed to conduct certain activities that are financial in nature by virtue of Huntington’s status as an FHC, as discussed in more detail in Item 1. Regulatory Matters.  If Huntington or the Bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for Huntington to continue to qualify as an FHC, the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a FHC.  If the failure to meet these standards persists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by a BHC but not an FHC.Reputation Risk:Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and employees is affected by our reputation.  Significant harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including officer, director or employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, security breaches, litigation or regulatory outcomes, compensation practices, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of personal, proprietary or confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, perception of our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures, and the activities of our clients, customers, and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation indirectly by association.  In addition, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media, whether or not factually correct, may affect our business prospects.  All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation, and financial condition.Risks related to the TCF Merger:We are expected to incur substantial costs related to the Merger and integration. We have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the Merger. These costs include legal, financial advisory, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees, severance/employee benefit-related costs, public company filing fees and other regulatory fees and financial printing and other related costs. Some of these costs are payable by us regardless of whether or not the Merger is completed. The combined company is expected to incur substantial costs in connection with the related integration. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that may need to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, payroll, compliance, treasury management, branch operations, vendor management, risk management, lines of business, pricing and benefits. While we have assumed that a certain level of costs will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration costs. Moreover, many of the costs that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration costs may result in the combined company taking charges against 39     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contentsearnings following the completion of the Merger, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present. Combining Huntington and TCF may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected and Huntington and TCF may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The success of the Merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of Huntington and TCF. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the Merger, Huntington and TCF must successfully integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits those cost savings to be realized. If Huntington and TCF are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings and anticipated benefits of the Merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional unforeseen expenses. Huntington and TCF have operated and, until the completion of the Merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies’ ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert management attention and resources. In addition, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may make it more costly or more difficult to integrate the businesses of Huntington and TCF, which, in turn, may make it more difficult for the combined company to realize anticipated synergies or cost savings in the amounts estimated or in the timeframe contemplated or at all. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each of Huntington and TCF during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the Merger on the combined company. The future results of the combined company following the Merger may suffer if the combined company does not effectively manage its expanded operations. Following the Merger, the size of the business of the combined company will increase significantly beyond the current size of either Huntington’s or TCF’s business. The combined company’s future success will depend, in part, upon its ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. The combined company may also face increased scrutiny from governmental authorities as a result of the significant increase in the size of its business. There can be no assurances that the combined company will be successful or that it will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the Merger. The combined company may be unable to retain Huntington or TCF personnel successfully while the Merger is pending or after the Merger is completed. The success of the Merger will depend in part on the combined company’s ability to retain key employees currently employed by Huntington and TCF. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with Huntington or TCF, as applicable, while the Merger is pending or with the combined company after the Merger is consummated. If Huntington and TCF are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, Huntington and TCF could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, if key employees terminate their employment, the combined company’s business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating Huntington and TCF to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause the combined company’s business to suffer. In addition, Huntington and TCF may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company. 2020 Form 10-K     40Table of ContentsThe COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the Merger. The COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of Huntington and TCF. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of Huntington or TCF, or the business operations of Huntington or TCF are further disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to complete the Merger and integrate the businesses of Huntington and TCF may also be delayed and adversely affected. Additional time may be required to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals, and the Federal Reserve, the OCC and/or other regulators may impose additional requirements on Huntington or TCF that must be satisfied prior to completion of the Merger, which could delay and adversely affect the completion of the Merger. Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the Merger. Before the Merger and the Bank Merger may be completed, various approvals, consents and non-objections must be obtained from the Federal Reserve, the OCC and other regulatory authorities. These approvals could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to any or all of the following: an adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing, or any other factors considered by regulators in granting such approvals; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; changes in legislation or the political environment, including as a result of changes of the U.S. executive administration, Congressional leadership and regulatory agency leadership; or impacts and disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. The approvals that are granted may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, require branch divestitures, or place restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions or that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of the combined company following the Merger or will otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the Merger. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the Merger. Additionally, the completion of the Merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any governmental entity of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Despite the parties’ commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to respond to any request for information and resolve any objection that may be asserted by any governmental entity with respect to the Merger Agreement, neither Huntington, TCF nor their respective subsidiaries is required under the terms of the Merger Agreement to take any action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or restriction in connection with obtaining these approvals, that would reasonably be likely to have a material adverse effect on the combined company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the Merger. Termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively affect Huntington. If the Merger is not completed for any reason, including as a result of Huntington shareholders or TCF shareholder failing to approve the proposal for the Merger, there may be various adverse consequences and Huntington may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from their customers and employees. For example, Huntington’s businesses may have been affected adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the Merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, Huntington may be required to pay a termination fee of $238.8 million to TCF. Additionally, Huntington has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including legal, accounting and financial advisory costs, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus 41     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contentsfor the Merger, and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger. If the Merger is not completed, Huntington would have to pay these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the Merger. Huntington will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending. Uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on Huntington. These uncertainties may impair Huntington’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with Huntington to seek to change existing business relationships with Huntington. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, Huntington has agreed to operate its business in the ordinary course prior to closing, and has agreed not to take certain actions, which could cause Huntington to be unable to pursue other beneficial opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the Merger. Shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of the Merger or otherwise negatively affect the business and operations of Huntington. Huntington may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the Merger. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of Huntington and could prevent or delay the consummation of the Merger. The Merger Agreement subjects Huntington to certain restrictions on its business activities prior to the Effective Time. The Merger Agreement subjects Huntington to certain restrictions on its business activities prior to the Effective Time. Subject to certain specified exceptions, the Merger Agreement obligates Huntington to, and to cause each of its subsidiaries to, take no action that would reasonably be likely to adversely affect or delay the ability of either Huntington or TCF to obtain any necessary approvals of any regulatory agency or other governmental entity required for the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement or to perform its respective covenants and agreements under the Merger Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement on a timely basis. These restrictions could prevent Huntington from pursuing certain business opportunities that arise prior to the Effective Time. The COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the combined company’s business and operations is uncertain. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will negatively affect the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of the combined company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the direct and indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on employees, clients, counterparties and service providers, as well as other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the combined company’s business, and there is no guarantee that efforts by the combined company to address the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will be effective. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, the combined company may continue to experience adverse impacts to its business as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic’s global economic impact, including reduced availability of credit, adverse impacts on liquidity and the negative financial effects from any recession or depression that may occur"
10,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2020-02-14,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 Huntington has formalized a holistic risk governance framework in alignment with the size, complexity, and profile of the Company.  We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control.  Our framework is approved by the Risk Oversight Committee (ROC) of the Huntington’s Board of Directors (the Board).  Key components include establishing our risk appetite, line of defense and risk pillars, governance and committee oversight and limit setting and escalation processes.  Huntington classifies/aggregates risk into seven risk pillars.  Huntington recognizes that risks can be interrelated or embedded within each other, and therefore managing across risk pillars is a key component of the Framework.  The following defines the Company’s risk pillars.•Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; •Market risk, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital.  Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); •Liquidity risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due.  Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels.  Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; •Operational risk, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, including information security breaches or cyberattacks, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events.  Operational losses result from internal fraud, external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management;•Compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions, or other sanctions as a result of non-conformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry;•Strategic risk, which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry / market changes; and  •Reputation risk, which is the risk that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.Credit Risks:Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers.  Our ACL of $887 million at December 31, 2019, represented management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio (ALLL) as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC).  We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness.  In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs.  There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets.  If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.2019 Form 10-K     23Table of ContentsIn addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, in June 2016, the FASB issued a new CECL accounting rule, which requires banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset on loans and held-to-maturity securities, as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred.  We are required to adopt the CECL accounting rule in 2020 and will recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to our ACL and retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.  The CECL model could materially affect how we determine our ACL and report our financial condition and results of operations.  For further discussion, see Note 2 “Accounting Standards Update” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties.  These conditions could result in one or more of the following:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.  The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets.  This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings).  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions.  Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates.  In addition, decisions by the Federal Reserve to increase or reduce the size of its balance sheet may also affect interest rates.  If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted.  Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.  Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage servicing rights.  An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income.  However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income.  In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  A decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits.  24     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsRising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities.  Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio.  Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios.  In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments.  For more information, refer to “Market Risk” of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are sensitive to rising and falling rates.  Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase.  Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease.  In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments.  Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise.In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client-based transactions.  Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify.  Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits.  In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services.  Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business.  Technological advances have made it possible for our non-bank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including mobile payments, online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing, and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence where their customers are located.  Legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector.  For example, the Economic Growth Act and the Tailoring Rules reduce the regulatory burden of certain large BHCs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large BHCs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion.  Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, electronic platforms, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products.  If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected.  In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin.  For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1: Business.Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.LIBOR and certain other interest rate “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform.  These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit information to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021.  The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), has selected SOFR as its recommended alternative to LIBOR.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish SOFR in April 2018.  SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market.  At this time, it 2019 Form 10-K     25Table of Contentsis impossible to predict whether SOFR will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR. In January of 2020, Huntington was added as an ARRC member. The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as SOFR, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In particular, any such transition could:•Adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of Huntington’s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include certain variable rate loans, Huntington’s Series B preferred stock, certain of Huntington’s junior subordinated debentures, certain of the Bank’s senior notes and certain other securities or financial arrangements;•Adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR’s role in determining market interest rates globally;•Prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of Huntington’s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and•Result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts and securities.The transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition Huntington’s risk management and other processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate, such as SOFR.  Huntington has developed a LIBOR transition team and project plan that outlines timelines and priorities to prepare its processes, systems and people to support this transition.  Timelines and priorities include assessing the impact on our customers, as well as assessing system requirements for operational processes.  There can be no guarantee that these efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.The manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.Liquidity Risks:Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost.  The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers.  The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular.  The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g., changes in FDIC insurance, the LCR, etc.), changes in the financial condition of Huntington, other banks, or the banking industry in general, changes in the interest rates our competitors pay on their deposits, and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.We are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds.  Huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank.  The Bank conducts most of our operations, and Huntington depends upon dividends from the Bank to service Huntington’s debt and to pay dividends to Huntington’s shareholders.  The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations.  It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to Huntington by the Bank.  In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary’s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries.  In the event that the 26     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsBank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock.  Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Preferred and Common Stock.  Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt.  The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets.  We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank.  The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.  We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate Huntington and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies.  There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings.  A downgrade of the credit ratings of Huntington or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities.  This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.Operational Risks:Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions.  Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance.  We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance, failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk.  For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely.  Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services.  Such events may include: sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist attacks.  Additional events beyond our control that could impact our business directly or indirectly include natural disasters such as earthquakes and weather events, including tornadoes, hurricanes and floods.  Neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of these events can be predicted, and the frequency and severity of weather events may be impacted by climate changes.  In addition, we may need to take our systems off-line if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack.  In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data.  In addition, our ability to implement backup 2019 Form 10-K     27Table of Contentssystems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems.  We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.  This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions.  Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring, and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs.  Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.  In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft.  Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties.  In addition, to access our network, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.We, our customers, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks.  These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ network access or business operations.  As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents.  Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches, which may result in material losses or consequences for us.Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions.  For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.  In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage.  Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise.  Due to increasing geopolitical tensions, nation state cyber attacks and ransomware are both increasing in sophistication and prevalence.  Targeted social engineering and email attacks (i.e. “spear phishing” attacks) are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent.  In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.  Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive.  The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred.  The speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited often before security patches are published continues to rise.  The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years.  Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may 28     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contentsnot be disclosed to us in a timely manner.We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the customers, clients, and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power.  As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us.  This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.  Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or expand our business.Cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences.  Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business.  Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm.  A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; or damage to our or our customers’ and/or third parties’ computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.As cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus.  The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations that would enhance cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including us and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness.  Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data.  For more information regarding cybersecurity and data privacy, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.We receive, maintain, and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information.  The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of these types of information are governed by federal and state law.  Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information and personal financial information that is collected and handled.  For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the CCPA.  The CCPA, which became effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds.  For more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain.  We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy 2019 Form 10-K     29Table of Contentspolicies.  If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer, or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted, or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies, or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results.We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures.  Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers.  There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack.  These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products, and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities.  Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions.  Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire.  These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions.  Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests.  Additionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values.  Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction.  Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud.  We are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures.  Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments.  Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process).  Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations.  These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant.  Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution.  Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are 30     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contentsadequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, inaccurate data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.All models have certain limitations.  Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information.  In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate.  If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions.  Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable.  Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses.  Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information are insufficient.We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.  We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs.  Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities.  When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility.  The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships.  Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships.  Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.  Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business.  While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business.  Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses.  Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements.  Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied.  For further discussion, see Note 2 - “Accounting Standards Update” to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.Our goodwill could become impaired in the future.  If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington, adversely impacting Huntington liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt.  The most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our Common Stock, projections of earnings, the discount rates used in the income approach to fair value, and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present.  If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.  If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an 2019 Form 10-K     31Table of Contentsimpairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank’s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings.  At December 31, 2019, the book value of our goodwill was $2.0 billion, substantially all of which was recorded at the Bank.  Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce Huntington’s earnings, as well.  Compliance Risks:We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.The banking industry is highly regulated.  We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, CFPB, FDIC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies.  The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole - not to protect shareholders.  These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividend or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs.  Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes.  Such regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.  Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base, and the price of our securities.  Further, any new laws, rules, and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject increased in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes.  Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector.  Compliance with these laws and regulations have resulted in and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations, especially those that apply to our consumer operations, which has been an area of heightened focus, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results.  32     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of ContentsThe resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high.  Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.For more information on litigation risks, see Note 21 - “Commitments and Contingent Liabilities”  to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss.  The Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.  The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.  FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC.  If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.For more information regarding the Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act, anti-money laundering requirements and OFAC-administered sanctions, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.Strategic Risk:We depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel.  The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected.  Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel.  We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate.  Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve.  The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations.  The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.2019 Form 10-K     33Table of ContentsBank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the annual CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity.  Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers CCAR, an annual forward-looking quantitative assessment of Huntington’s capital adequacy and planned capital distributions and a review of the strength of Huntington’s practices to assess capital needs.  We generally may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve and as to which the Federal Reserve has not objected.  The Federal Reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio after making all capital actions included in Huntington’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon.  There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to our capital plans, planned capital actions or stress test results, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases.  We are also required to maintain minimum capital ratios and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that Huntington and/or the Bank, based on size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain capital ratios above these minimums in order to operate in a safe and sound manner.  In the event we are required to raise capital to maintain required minimum capital and leverage ratios or ratios above the required applicable minimums, we may be forced to do so when market conditions are undesirable or on terms that are less favorable to us than we would otherwise require.  Furthermore, in order to prevent becoming subject to restrictions on our ability to distribute capital or make certain discretionary bonus payments to management, we must maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer (of 2.5% as of January 1, 2019), which is in addition to our required minimum capital ratios.For more information regarding CCAR, stress testing, and capital and liquidity requirements, including several proposed rules that would alter, reduce, or eliminate certain of these requirements as they apply to Huntington, refer to Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions.  In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends.  Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services.  We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies.  As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in Item 1: Business - “Regulatory Matters”.  As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization.  Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including charging monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.Under the supervision of the CFPB, our Consumer and Business Banking products and services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations.  We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions.  Also, federal and state regulators have been increasingly focused on sales practices of branch personnel, including taking regulatory action against other financial institutions.  In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, increase the cost of collection, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.In addition, we are allowed to conduct certain activities that are financial in nature by virtue of Huntington’s status as an FHC, as discussed in more detail in Item 1. Regulatory Matters.  If Huntington or the Bank cease to meet 34     Huntington Bancshares IncorporatedTable of Contentsthe requirements necessary for Huntington to continue to qualify as an FHC, the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a FHC.  If the failure to meet these standards persists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by a BHC but not an FHC.Reputation Risk:Damage to our reputation could significantly harm our business, including our competitive position and business prospects.Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and employees is affected by our reputation.  Significant harm to our reputation can arise from various sources, including officer, director or employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, security breaches, litigation or regulatory outcomes, compensation practices, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of personal, proprietary or confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, perception of our environmental, social and governance practices and disclosures, and the activities of our clients, customers, and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation indirectly by association. In addition, adverse publicity or negative information posted on social media, whether or not factually correct, may affect our business prospects.  All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation, and financial condition"
9,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2019-02-15,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control.  Among these risks are: •Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; •Market risk, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital.  Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); •Liquidity risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due.  Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels.  Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; •Operational and Legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events.  Operational losses result from internal fraud, external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management.  Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to orders, fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from litigation, as well as regulatory actions; •Compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions, or other sanctions as a result of non-conformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry;•Strategic risk, which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry / market changes; and  •Reputation risk, which is the risk that negative publicity regarding an institution’s business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.Credit Risks:Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers.  Our ACL of $868 million at December 31, 2018, represented Management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio (ALLL) as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC).  We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness.  In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs.  There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets.  If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Furthermore, in June 2016, the FASB issued a new current expected credit loss rule, which will require banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and held-to-maturity securities, as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred.  We are required to adopt the current expected credit loss rule in 2020 and expect to recognize a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to our ACL and retained earnings as of January 1, 2020.  The current expected credit loss model could materially affect how we determine our ACL and report our financial condition and results of operations.  For further discussion, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial StatementsWeakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties.  These conditions could result in one or more of the following:22Table of Contents•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.  The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets.  This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings).  Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions.  Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates.  In addition, after an extended period during which the Federal Reserve increased the size of its balance sheet substantially above historical levels through the purchase of debt securities, the Federal Reserve has begun to reduce the size of its balance sheet from these elevated levels, which might also affect interest rates.  If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted.  Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.  After a prolonged period of low and relatively stable interest rates, interest rates rose over the course of 2017 and 2018, although interest rates continue to remain low by historical standards.Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights.  An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.  When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income.  However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income.  In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  A decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits.  Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities.  Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio.  Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios.  In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments.  For more information, refer to “Market Risk” of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are very sensitive to rising and falling rates.  Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase.  Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease.  In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments.  Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise.In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions.  Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully.  We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify.  Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits.  In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services.  Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business.  Technological advances have made it possible for our non-bank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other 23Table of Contentscompanies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including mobile payments, online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing, and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence where their customers are located.  Legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector.  For example, the Economic Growth Act and, if adopted, the Proposed Tailoring Rules reduce the regulatory burden of certain large BHCs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply, which could cause certain large BHCs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion.  Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, electronic platforms, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products.  If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected.  In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin.  For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1.  Business.Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.LIBOR and certain other interest rate “benchmarks” are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform.  These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted.  On July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit information to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021.  The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot be guaranteed after 2021. While there is no consensus on what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee, has selected the Secured Overnight Finance Rate as its recommended alternative to LIBOR.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York started to publish the Secured Overnight Financing Rate in April 2018.  The Secured Overnight Financing Rate is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by Treasury securities that was selected by the Alternative Reference Rate Committee due to the depth and robustness of the U.S. Treasury repurchase market.  At this time, it is impossible to predict whether the Secured Overnight Financing Rate will become an accepted alternative to LIBOR.The market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In particular, any such transition could:•adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of Huntington’s LIBOR-based assets and liabilities, which include certain variable rate loans, Huntington’s Series B preferred stock, certain of Huntington’s junior subordinated debentures, certain of the Bank’s senior notes and certain other securities or financial arrangements;•adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on, the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR’s role in determining market interest rates globally;•prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of Huntington’s preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate; and•result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based contracts and securities.The transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will require the transition to or development of appropriate systems and analytics to effectively transition Huntington’s risk management and other processes from LIBOR-based products to those based on the applicable alternative reference rate, such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.  Huntington has developed a LIBOR transition team and project plan that outlines timelines and priorities to prepare its processes, systems and people to support this transition.  Timelines and priorities include assessing the impact on our customers, as well as assessing system requirements for operational processes.  There can be no guarantee that these efforts will successfully mitigate the operational risks associated with the transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate.The manner and impact of the transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, loan and investment and trading securities portfolios, asset-liability management, and business, is uncertain.24Table of ContentsLiquidity Risks:Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost.  The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers.  The board of directors establishes liquidity policies, including contingency funding plans, and limits, and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity.Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers.  The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular.  The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g., changes in FDIC insurance, the LCR, etc.), changes in the financial condition of Huntington, other banks, or the banking industry in general, changes in the interest rates our competitors pay on their deposits, and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits.  Recently, competition for deposits has increased and interest rates paid on deposits have generally risen.  While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.We are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds.  Huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank.  The Bank conducts most of our operations, and Huntington depends upon dividends from the Bank to service Huntington’s debt and to pay dividends to Huntington’s shareholders.  The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations.  It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to Huntington by the Bank.  In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary’s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries.  In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock.  Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Preferred and Common Stock.  Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1.  Regulatory Matters.If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt.  The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets.  We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank.  The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital.  We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate Huntington and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies.  There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings.  A downgrade of the credit ratings of Huntington or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities.  This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.Operational and Legal Risks:Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions.  Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance.  We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human 25Table of Contentserror, misconduct, malfeasance, or failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk.  For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely.  In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems.  Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup, or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services.  Such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications, or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, and floods; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist acts.  In addition, we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack.  In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data.  We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws, rules, and regulations.  This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions.  Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring, and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs.  Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity, and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm.  In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities, or identity theft.  Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval of confidential, proprietary, and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties.  In addition, to access our network, products, and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.We, our customers, regulators, and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks.  These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss, or destruction of confidential, proprietary, and other information of ours, our employees, our customers, or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ network access or business operations.  As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents.  Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies, and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches.  Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions.  For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.  In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists, and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage.  Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise.  Targeted social engineering attacks and “spear phishing” attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent.  In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers, or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.  Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive.  The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched, and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred.  The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years.  Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity, and operational risks relating to the customers, clients, and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators, and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power.  As a result of increasing 26Table of Contentsconsolidation, interdependence, and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes, or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us.  This consolidation, interconnectivity, and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis.  Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack, or other information or security breach, termination, or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk, or expand our business.Cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences.  Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business.  Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm.  A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; or damage to our or our customers’ and/or third parties’ computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.  In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high.  Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects.  It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.For more information on litigation risks, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures.  Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers.  There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack.  These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products, and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities.  Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions.  Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire.  These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions.  Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests.  Additionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values.  Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction.  Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud.  We are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures.  Such controls and procedures are modified, 27Table of Contentssupplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments.  Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process).  Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations.  These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant.  Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution.  Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, inaccurate data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.All models have certain limitations.  Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information.  In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate.  If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions.  Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable.  Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses.  Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.  We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs.  Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities.  When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility.  The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships.  Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships.  Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.  Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business.  While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business.  Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses.  Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements.  Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied.  For further discussion, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.Our goodwill could become impaired in the future.  If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington, adversely impacting Huntington liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt.  The most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our Common Stock, projections of earnings, the discount rates used in the income approach to fair value, and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us.  We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present.  If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment.  If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the 28Table of Contentstangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank’s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank’s ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings.  At December 31, 2018, the book value of our goodwill was $2.0 billion, substantially all of which was recorded at the Bank.  Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce Huntington’s earnings, as well.  Negative publicity could damage our reputation and could significantly harm our business.  Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation.  Public perception of the financial services industry in general was damaged as a result of the financial crisis that started in 2008.  We face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the financial crisis and economic downturn.  Significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, litigation, GSE or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, and the activities of our clients, customers, and counterparties, including vendors.  Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation, indirectly by association.  All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation, and financial condition.  We depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services.  We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel.  The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer, and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected.  Leadership changes will occur from time to time, and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel.  We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate.  Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve.  The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations.  The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or operating results.Compliance Risks:We operate in a highly regulated industry, and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.The banking industry is highly regulated.  We are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, CFPB, FDIC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies.  The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole-not to protect shareholders.  These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividend or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt, and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.  Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly, and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs.  Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes.  Such regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities.  Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines, and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base, and the price of our securities.  Further, any new laws, rules, and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.29Table of ContentsBank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the annual CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity.  Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers CCAR, an annual forward-looking quantitative assessment of Huntington’s capital adequacy and planned capital distributions and a review of the strength of Huntington’s practices to assess capital needs.  We generally may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve and as to which the Federal Reserve has not objected.  The Federal Reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio after making all capital actions included in Huntington’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon.  There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to our capital plans, planned capital actions or stress test results, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases.  We are also required to maintain minimum capital ratios and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that Huntington and/or the Bank, based on size, complexity, or risk profile, must maintain capital ratios above these minimums in order to operate in a safe and sound manner.  In the event we are required to raise capital to maintain required minimum capital and leverage ratios or ratios above the required applicable minimums, we may be forced to do so when market conditions are undesirable or on terms that are less favorable to us than we would otherwise require.  Furthermore, in order to prevent becoming subject to restrictions on our ability to distribute capital or make certain discretionary bonus payments to management, we must maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer (of 1.875% in 2018 and 2.5% as of January 1, 2019), which is in addition to our required minimum capital ratios.We are also currently subject to a modified LCR requirement that requires Huntington to maintain an adequate amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets, such as Treasury securities and other sovereign debt, to cover projected net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress scenario window.  Because the LCR assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits, banks’ demand for and the cost of these deposits may increase.  Additionally, the LCR has increased the demand for direct U.S.  government and U.S. government-guaranteed debt that, while high quality, generally carry lower yields than other securities BHCs hold in their investment portfolios.For more information regarding CCAR, stress testing, and capital and liquidity requirements, including several proposed rules that would alter, reduce, or eliminate certain of these requirements as they apply to Huntington, refer to Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions.  In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends.  Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services.  We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies.  As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in Item 1. Regulatory Matters.  As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization.  Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including charging monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.Under the supervision of the CFPB, our Consumer and Business Banking products and services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations.  We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions.  Also, federal and state regulators have been increasingly focused on sales practices of branch personnel, including taking regulatory action against other financial institutions.  In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, increase the cost of collection, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.In addition, we are allowed to conduct certain activities that are financial in nature by virtue of Huntington’s status as an FHC, as discussed in more detail in Item 1. Regulatory Matters.  If Huntington or the Bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for Huntington to continue to qualify as an FHC, the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a FHC.  If the failure to meet these standards persists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by a BHC but not an FHC.30Table of ContentsLegislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject increased in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes.  Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector.  Compliance with these laws and regulations have resulted in and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations, especially those that apply to our consumer operations, which has been an area of heightened focus, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results.  We may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the Federal Reserve and FDIC determine that our resolution plan is not credible.  Huntington is required to submit annually to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan for its orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that our resolution plan is not credible, we could become subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions, or restrictions on our growth, activities, or operations.  If we were to fail to address deficiencies in our resolution plan when required, we could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in ways that could negatively impact our operations and strategy.For more information regarding resolution planning requirements, refer to Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss.  The Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities.  The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies.  FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration, and IRS.There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC.  If our policies, procedures, and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures, and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.For more information regarding the Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act, anti-money laundering requirements and OFAC-administered sanctions, refer to Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus.  As cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus.  The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including us and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness.  Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data.  For more information regarding cybersecurity, refer to Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.We receive, maintain, and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information.  The sharing, use, disclosure, and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law.  Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled.  For example, in June of 2018, the Governor of California signed into law the CCPA.  The CCPA, which becomes effective on January 1, 2020, applies to for-profit businesses that conduct business in California and meet certain revenue or data 31Table of Contentscollection thresholds.  For more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations, refer to Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain.  We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies.  If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer, or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted, or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation, or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies, or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results"
11,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2018-02-16,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control. Among these risks are: •Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; •Market risk, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital. Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); •Liquidity risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect our ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; •Operational and Legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud; external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management.  Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to orders, fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from litigation, as well as regulatory actions; •Compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of non-conformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry;•Strategic risk, which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry / market changes; and  •Reputation risk, which is the risk that negative publicity regarding an institution's business practices, whether true or not, will cause a decline in the customer base, costly litigation, or revenue reductions.In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.Credit Risks:Our ACL level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $778 million at December 31, 2017, represented Management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio (ALLL) as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit (AULC). We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.19Table of ContentsMarket Risks:Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. In addition, the Federal Reserve has stated its intention to end its quantitative easing program and has begun to reduce the size of its balance sheet by selling securities, which might also affect interest rates.  If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  A decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits.  Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments. For more information, refer to “Market Risk” of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are very sensitive to rising and falling rates. Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise.In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions.  Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits. In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Technological advances have made it possible for our non-bank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internet-based financial solutions, including online deposit accounts, electronic payment processing and marketplace lending, without having a physical presence where their customers are located. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, electronic platforms, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin.  For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1: Business.Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business.On July 27, 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 20Table of Contents2021. The announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, including Huntington’s Series B preferred stock, certain of Huntington’s junior subordinated debentures, certain of the Bank’s senior notes, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR’s role in determining market interest rates globally. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely affect LIBOR rates and other interest rates. In the event that a published LIBOR rate is unavailable after 2021, the dividend rate on Huntington’s Series B preferred stock and the interest rate on Huntington’s and the Bank’s debentures and notes, which are currently based on the LIBOR rate, will be determined as set forth in the offering documents, and the value of such securities may be adversely affected. Currently, the manner and impact of this transition and related developments, as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs, investment and trading securities portfolios and business, is uncertain.Liquidity Risks:Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. The board of directors establishes liquidity policies, including contingency funding plans, and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity.Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers. The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g. changes in FDIC insurance, the LCR, etc.), changes in the financial condition of Huntington, other banks or the banking industry in general, and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.We are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds. Huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of our operations and Huntington depends upon dividends from the Bank to service Huntington's debt and to pay dividends to Huntington's shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to Huntington by the Bank. In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary’s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries. In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock. Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1. Regulatory Matters.If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.21Table of ContentsA reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to raise funds including capital, and/or the holders of our securities.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate Huntington and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of Huntington or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability and financial condition, including liquidity.Operational and Legal Risks:Our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could fail or be breached, which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause legal or reputational harm.The potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and, as a result of our interactions with, and reliance on, third parties, is not limited to our own internal operational functions. Our operational and security systems and infrastructure, including our computer systems, data management, and internal processes, as well as those of third parties, are integral to our performance. We rely on our employees and third parties in our day-to-day and ongoing operations, who may, as a result of human error, misconduct, malfeasance or failure, or breach of our or of third-party systems or infrastructure, expose us to risk. For example, our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely. In addition, our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to third-party systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems. Our financial, accounting, data processing, backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors, including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services. Such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume; electrical, telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages; natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods; disease pandemics; cyber-attacks; and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters, including wars and terrorist acts. In addition, we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyber-attack. In the event that backup systems are utilized, they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems, potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data. We frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. This updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones, including business interruptions. Implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems, security monitoring and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs. Operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations, liquidity and financial condition, as well as cause reputational harm. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption.We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties, on which we are highly dependent, are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Our business relies on the secure processing, transmission, storage and retrieval of confidential, proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks, and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties. In addition, to access our network, products and services, our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks.We, our customers, regulators and other third parties, including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing, have been subject to, and are likely to continue to be the target of, cyber-attacks. These cyber-attacks include computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, phishing attacks, denial of service or information, ransomware, improper access by employees or vendors, attacks on personal email of employees, ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other information of ours, our employees, our customers or of third parties, damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers’ or other third parties’ network access or business operations. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents. Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls, processes, policies and other protective measures, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Cyber threats 22Table of Contentsare rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.Cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions. For example, cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications. In addition, cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations, hostile foreign governments, disgruntled employees or vendors, activists and other external parties, including those involved in corporate espionage. Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks and ""spear phishing"" attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. In such an attack, an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. The risk of a security breach caused by a cyber-attack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years. Additionally, the existence of cyber-attacks or security breaches at third-party vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner.We also face indirect technology, cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers, clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities, including, for example, financial counterparties, regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power. As a result of increasing consolidation, interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems, a technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades, deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants, including us. This consolidation, interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure, on both individual and industry-wide bases, as disparate systems need to be integrated, often on an accelerated basis. Any third-party technology failure, cyber-attack or other information or security breach, termination or constraint could, among other things, adversely affect our ability to effect transactions, service our clients, manage our exposure to risk or expand our business.Cyber-attacks or other information or security breaches, whether directed at us or third parties, may result in a material loss or have material consequences. Furthermore, the public perception that a cyber-attack on our systems has been successful, whether or not this perception is correct, may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business. Hacking of personal information and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including our loss of customers and business opportunities, costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach; significant business disruption to our operations and business, misappropriation, exposure, or destruction of our confidential information, intellectual property, funds, and/or those of our customers; or damage to our or our customers’ and/or third parties’ computers or systems, and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws, litigation exposure, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, loss of confidence in our security measures, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, additional compliance costs, and could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event.The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements updates the status of certain litigation. We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures. Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers. There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack. These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.23Table of ContentsMoreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions.  Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire. These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions.  Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests.  Additionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process). Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, inaccurate data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.All models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information. In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.  We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships.  Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.  Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively 24Table of Contentsmanage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses. Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. In June 2016, the FASB issued a new current expected credit loss rule, which will require banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and held-to-maturity securities, as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred. Changes in accounting policies, standards and interpretations can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.For further discussion, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  Impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.Our goodwill could become impaired in the future. If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington, adversely impacting Huntington liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt. The most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our Common Stock, projections of earnings, the discount rates used in the income approach to fair value, and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us. We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank’s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank's ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings.  At December 31, 2017, the book value of our goodwill was $2.0 billion, substantially all of which was recorded at the Bank. Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce Huntington’s earnings, as well.  Negative publicity could damage our reputation and could significantly harm our business. Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation. Public perception of the financial services industry in general was damaged as a result of the credit crisis that started in 2008. We face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the credit crisis and economic downturn. Significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, litigation, GSE or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation, indirectly by association. All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation and financial condition. We depend on our executive officers and key personnel to continue the implementation of our long-term business strategy and could be harmed by the loss of their services. We believe that our continued growth and future success will depend in large part on the skills of our management team and our ability to motivate and retain these individuals and other key personnel. The loss of service of one or more of our executive officers or key personnel could reduce our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy, our business could suffer and the value of our stock could be materially adversely affected. Leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel. We believe our management team possesses valuable knowledge about the banking industry and that their knowledge and relationships would be very difficult to replicate. Our success also depends on the experience of our branch managers and lending officers and on their relationships with the customers and communities they serve. The loss of these key personnel could negatively impact our banking operations. The loss of key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or operating results.25Table of ContentsCompliance Risks:We operate in a highly regulated industry and the laws and regulations that govern our operations, corporate governance, executive compensation and financial accounting, or reporting, including changes in them, or our failure to comply with them, may adversely affect us.The banking industry is highly regulated. We are subject to supervision, regulation and examination by various federal and state regulators, including the Federal Reserve, OCC, SEC, CFPB, FDIC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. The statutory and regulatory framework that governs us is generally intended to protect depositors and customers, the DIF, the U.S. banking and financial system, and financial markets as a whole-not to protect shareholders. These laws and regulations, among other matters, prescribe minimum capital requirements, impose limitations on our business activities (including foreclosure and collection practices), limit the dividend or distributions that we can pay, restrict the ability of institutions to guarantee our debt and impose certain specific accounting requirements that may be more restrictive and may result in greater or earlier charges to earnings or reductions in our capital than accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Compliance with laws and regulations can be difficult and costly and changes to laws and regulations often impose additional compliance costs. Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years in response to the financial crisis, as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Such regulation and supervision may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. Further, our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, even if the failure was inadvertent or reflects a difference in interpretation, could subject us to restrictions on our business activities, fines and other penalties, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations, capital base and the price of our securities. Further, any new laws, rules and regulations could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business and financial condition.Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the annual CCAR assessment process and the U.S. Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers CCAR, an annual forward-looking quantitative assessment of Huntington’s capital adequacy and planned capital distributions and a review of the strength of Huntington’s practices to assess capital needs. We generally may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the Federal Reserve and as to which the Federal Reserve has not objected. The Federal Reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio after making all capital actions included in Huntington’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. The Bank also must submit a capital plan to the OCC. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to our capital plans, planned capital actions or stress test results, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases. We are also required to maintain minimum capital ratios and the Federal Reserve and OCC may determine that Huntington and/or the Bank, based on size, complexity or risk profile, must maintain capital ratios above these minimums in order to operate in a safe and sound manner. In the event we are required to raise capital to maintain required minimum capital and leverage ratios or ratios above the required applicable minimums, we may be forced to do so in when market conditions are undesirable or on terms that are less favorable to us than we would otherwise require. Furthermore, in order to prevent becoming subject to restrictions on our ability to distribute capital or make certain discretionary bonus payments to management, we must maintain a Capital Conservation Buffer (of 1.875% in 2018), which is in addition to our required minimum capital ratios.We are also subject to a modified LCR requirement that requires Huntington to maintain an adequate amount of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets, such as Treasury securities and other sovereign debt, to cover projected net cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress scenario window. Because the LCR assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits, banks’ demand for and the cost of these deposits may increase. Additionally, the LCR has increased the demand for direct U.S. government and U.S. government-guaranteed debt that, while high quality, generally carry lower yields than other securities BHCs hold in their investment portfolios.For more information regarding CCAR, stress testing and capital and liquidity requirements, refer to Item 1. Regulatory Matters.If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions.  In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends.  Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services. We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in Item 1. Regulatory Matters. As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including charging monetary fines, 26Table of Contentsimpacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.Under the supervision of the CFPB, our Consumer and Business Banking products and services are subject to heightened regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. Also, federal and state regulators have been increasingly focused on sales practices of branch personnel, including taking regulatory action against other financial institutions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, increase the cost of collection, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.In addition, we are allowed to conduct certain activities that are financial in nature by virtue of Huntington’s status as an FHC, as discussed in more detail in Item 1. Regulatory Matters. If Huntington or the Bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for Huntington to continue to qualify as an FHC, the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a FHC. If the failure to meet these standards persists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by a BHC but not an FHC.Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.Both the scope of the laws and regulations and the intensity of the supervision to which we are subject have increased in recent years, in response to the financial crisis as well as other factors such as technological and market changes. Regulatory enforcement and fines have also increased across the banking and financial services sector. Compliance with these laws and regulations have resulted in and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations, especially those that apply to our consumer operations, which has been an area of heightened focus, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results. We may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the Federal Reserve and FDIC determine that our resolution plan is not credible. Huntington is required to submit annually to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan for its orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that our resolution plan is not credible, we could become subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions, or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations. If we were to fail to address deficiencies in our resolution plan when required, we could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in ways that could negatively impact its operations and strategy.For more information regarding resolution planning requirements, refer to Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.Noncompliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering statutes and regulations could cause us material financial loss. The Bank Secrecy Act and the Patriot Act contain anti-money laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect, and prevent the use of the U.S. financial system for, money laundering and terrorist financing activities. The Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the Patriot Act, requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an anti-money laundering program, verifying the identity of clients, monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions, reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds, and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies. FinCEN, a unit of the Treasury Department that administers the Bank Secrecy Act, is authorized to impose significant civil money penalties for violations of those requirements and has recently engaged in coordinated enforcement efforts with the federal bank regulatory agencies, as well as the United States Department of Justice, Drug Enforcement Administration and IRS.There is also increased scrutiny of compliance with the rules enforced by the OFAC. If our policies, procedures and systems are deemed deficient or the policies, procedures and systems of the financial institutions that we have already acquired or may acquire in the future are deficient, we would be subject to liability, including fines and regulatory actions such as restrictions on our ability to pay dividends and the necessity to obtain regulatory approvals to proceed with certain planned business activities, including acquisition plans, which would negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing could also have serious reputational consequences for us.27Table of ContentsFor more information regarding the Bank Secrecy Act, Patriot Act, anti-money laundering requirements and OFAC-administered sanctions, refer to Item 1: Business - Regulatory Matters.Cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus. As cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years, cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus. The federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards, which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their third-party service providers, including us and the Bank, and would focus on cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience and situational awareness. Several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations, which require, among other things, notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data.We receive, maintain and store non-public personal information of our customers and counterparties, including, but not limited to, personally identifiable information and personal financial information. The sharing, use, disclosure and protection of this information are governed by federal and state law. Both personally identifiable information and personal financial information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulation, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected and handled.We may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain. We could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies. If cybersecurity, data privacy, data protection, data transfer or data retention laws are implemented, interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices, we may be subject to fines, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices, policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results"
18,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2017-02-22,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 Risk GovernanceWe use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low. This does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities. Rather, the definition is intended to represent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managed.Three board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile: •The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements, including policies, procedures, and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial reporting process, disclosures, and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and independence; compliance with our Financial Code of Ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers; and compliance with corporate securities trading policies.•The Risk Oversight Committee assists the board of directors in overseeing management of material risks, the approval and monitoring of the Company’s capital position and plan supporting our overall aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile, the risk governance structure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and determining adherence to the board’s stated risk appetite. The committee has oversight responsibility with respect to the full range of inherent risks: market, credit, liquidity, legal, compliance/regulatory, operational, strategic, and reputational. This committee also oversees our capital management and planning process, ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks, and that our capital levels exceed “well-capitalized” requirements. •The Technology Committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology, cyber security, and third-party risk management strategies and plans. The committee is charged with evaluating Huntington’s capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan, including projected growth, technology capacity, planning, operational execution, product development, and management capacity. The committee provides oversight of technology investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk, security, and redundancy. The Committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors. The Technology Committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the Company’s strategic plans, including monitoring of overall industry trends. The Technology Committee reviews and provides oversight of the company’s continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparedness.The Audit and Risk Oversight Committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management. On a periodic basis, the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both, such as the construct and appropriateness of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly. All directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors.Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior, including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management, a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the Company, a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards (50% for executive officers and 25% for other award recipients), equity deferrals, recoupment provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time.Management has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management and Risk Appetite Framework. Critically important is our self-assessment process, in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls. The segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors (e.g., credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, compliance, reputational, and strategic) to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment. Outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process, the direction of risk, and our position compared to the defined risk appetite.Management also utilizes a wide series of metrics (key risk indicators) to monitor risk positions throughout the Company. In general, a range for each metric is established, which allows the Company, in aggregate, to operate within an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. Deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance, which may then necessitate corrective action.We also have four executive level committees to manage risk: ALCO, Credit Policy and Strategy, Risk Management, and Capital Management. Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies.17Table of ContentsHuntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management: (1) business segments, (2) corporate risk management, and (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments, segment risk officers have been embedded in the business to identify and monitor risk, elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform self-testing, and oversee the self-assessment process. Corporate Risk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits, reviews new or modified products/processes, ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments, and produces the enterprise risk assessment. The Chief Risk Officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk. Internal Audit and Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related functions are operating as intended.Risk OverviewWe, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: •Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; •Market risk, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital. Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); •Liquidity risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the Bank’s ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; •Operational and legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud; external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management.  Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to orders, fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from litigation, as well as regulatory actions; •Compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of non-conformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry; and•Strategic risk, which is defined as risk to current or anticipated earnings, capital, or enterprise value arising from adverse business decisions, improper implementation of business decisions or lack of responsiveness to industry / market changes.  We also expend considerable effort to protect our reputation. Reputation risk does not easily lend itself to traditional methods of measurement. Rather, we closely monitor it through processes such as new product / initiative reviews, colleague and client surveys, monitoring media tone, periodic discussions between management and our board, and other such efforts.  In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.Credit Risks:1. Our ACL level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $736 million at December 31, 2016, represented Management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We regularly review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.18Table of Contents2. Weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business.Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.Market Risks:1. Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have an adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  A decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits.  Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments. For more information, refer to “Market Risk” of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are very sensitive to rising and falling rates. Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.MSR fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates, as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans, which can be reduced by prepayments. Prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise.In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions.  19Table of Contents2. Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits. In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin.  For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1: Business.Liquidity Risks:1. Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. The board of directors establishes liquidity policies, including contingency funding plans, and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity.Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers. The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g. changes in FDIC insurance, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, etc.), and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.2. We are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds. Huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the Bank. The Bank conducts most of our operations and Huntington depends upon dividends from the Bank to service Huntington's debt and to pay dividends to Huntington's shareholders. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the Bank and other factors, that the OCC could limit the payment of dividends or other payments by the Bank. In addition, the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiary’s state of incorporation, and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries. In the event that the Bank was unable to pay dividends to us, we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock. Our failure to pay dividends on our Preferred and Common Stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our Common Stock. Additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in Item 1. Regulatory Matters.3. If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of Huntington and the Bank. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.20Table of Contents4. A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our ability to raise funds including capital, and/or the holders of our securities.The credit rating agencies regularly evaluate Huntington and the Bank, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the financial services industry, the economy, and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of the credit ratings of Huntington or the Bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements, and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability and financial condition, including liquidity.Operational and Legal Risks:1. We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, including us. None of these events against us resulted in a breach of our client data or account information; however, the performance of our website, www.huntington.com, was adversely affected, and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing our website. We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. While events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience, future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time, and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks and ""spear phishing"" attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The successful social engineer will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.2. The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.Note 21 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements updates the status of certain material litigation including litigation related to the bankruptcy of Cyberco Holdings, Inc. 21Table of Contents3. We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures. Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers. There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack. These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees, accounting systems, and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions.  Acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire. These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions.  Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests.  Additionally, acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction. 4. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. We are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.5. We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process). Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, inaccurate data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.All models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information. In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.22Table of Contents6. We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.  We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships.  Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.  Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, control, and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses.7. Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.For further discussion, see Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  8. Impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings, which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations.Our goodwill could become impaired in the future. If goodwill were to become impaired, it could limit the ability of the Bank to pay dividends to Huntington Bancshares Incorporated, adversely impacting Huntington Bancshares Incorporated's liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt. The most significant assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation are variables including the market price of our Common Stock, projections of earnings, and the control premium above our current stock price that an acquirer would pay to obtain control of us. We are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our Common Stock, or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the Bank’s earnings and thereby restrict the Bank's ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval, because Federal Reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings.  At December 31, 2016, the book value of our goodwill was $2.0 billion, all of which was recorded at the Bank. Any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce Huntington’s earnings, as well.  9. Negative publicity could damage our reputation and could significantly harm our business. Our ability to attract and retain customers, clients, investors, and highly-skilled management and employees is affected by our reputation. Public perception of the financial services industry in general was damaged as a result of the credit crisis that started in 2008. We face increased public and regulatory scrutiny resulting from the credit crisis and economic downturn. Significant harm to our reputation can also arise from other sources, including employee misconduct, actual or perceived unethical behavior, conflicts of interest, litigation, GSE or regulatory actions, failing to deliver minimum or required standards of service and quality, failing to address customer and agency complaints, compliance failures, unauthorized release of confidential information due to cyber-attacks or otherwise, and the activities of our clients, customers and counterparties, including vendors. Actions by the financial service industry generally or by institutions or individuals in the industry can adversely affect our reputation, indirectly by association. All of these could adversely affect our growth, results of operation and financial condition. 23Table of ContentsCompliance Risks:1. Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the annual CCAR assessment process and the Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers the annual CCAR, an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs. Under CCAR, the Federal Reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forward-looking basis and reviews the strength of a bank holding company’s capital adequacy process. The Federal Reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, after making all capital actions included in a bank holding company’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. Capital plans for 2017 are required to be submitted by April 5, 2017, and the Federal Reserve will either object to the capital plan and/or planned capital actions, or provide a notice of non-objection, no later than June 30, 2017. We intend to submit our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5, 2017. The Bank also must submit a capital plan to the OCC on or before April 5, 2017. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan, capital actions or stress test and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases.In 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC adopted final rules to implement the Basel III capital rules for U.S. Banking organizations. The final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. As a Standardized Approach institution, the Basel III minimum capital requirements became effective for us on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum LCR requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, and a less stringent modified LCR requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The LCR requires covered banking organizations to maintain HQLA equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress scenario. We are covered by the modified LCR requirement and therefore subject to the phase-in of the rule which, as of January 2017, is at 100%. We will also be required to calculate the LCR monthly. The LCR assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits, which should increase the demand, and perhaps the cost, among banks for these deposits. Additionally, the HQLA requirements will increase the demand for direct US government and US government- guaranteed debt that, while high quality, generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolios.2. If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions.  In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends.  Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services. We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in Item 1. Regulatory Matters. As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including charging monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.Under the supervision of the CFPB, our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.24Table of Contents3. Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.The Dodd-Frank Act was a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, established the CFPB, and required the CFPB and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. Compliance with these new laws and regulations have and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results.  4. We may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the Federal Reserve and FDIC determine that our resolution plan is not credible. The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations jointly issued by Federal Reserve and the FDIC require bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC that, in the event of material financial distress or failure, establish the rapid, orderly resolution of the Company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that our 2015 resolution plan is not “credible,” we could become subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions, or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, and could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in ways that could negatively impact its operations and strategy.  5. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our financial holding company status.In order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we and the Bank must remain “well capitalized,” and “well managed.” If we or our Bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for us to continue to qualify as a financial holding company, the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a financial holding company. If the failure to meet these standards persists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies.  In addition, our ability to commence or engage in certain activities as a financial holding company will be restricted if the Bank fails to maintain at least a “Satisfactory” rating on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination"
17,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2016-02-17,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
Risk GovernanceWe use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low. This does not preclude engagement in select higher risk activities. Rather, the definition is intended to represent an aggregate view of where we want our overall risk to be managed.Three board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile: •The Audit Committee oversees the integrity of the consolidated financial statements, including policies, procedures, and practices regarding the preparation of financial statements, the financial reporting process, disclosures, and internal control over financial reporting. The Audit Committee also provides assistance to the board in overseeing the internal audit division and the independent registered public accounting firm’s qualifications and independence; compliance with our Financial Code of Ethics for the chief executive officer and senior financial officers; and compliance with corporate securities trading policies.•The Risk Oversight Committee assists the board of directors in overseeing management of material risks, the approval and monitoring of the Company’s capital position and plan supporting our overall aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile, the risk governance structure, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and determining adherence to the board’s stated risk appetite. The committee has oversight responsibility with respect to the full range of inherent risks: market, credit, liquidity, legal, compliance/regulatory, operational, strategic, and reputational. This committee also oversees our capital management and planning process, ensures that the amount and quality of capital are adequate in relation to expected and unexpected risks, and that our capital levels exceed “well-capitalized” requirements. •The Technology Committee assists the board of directors in fulfilling its oversight responsibilities with respect to all technology, cyber security, and third-party risk management strategies and plans. The committee is charged with evaluating Huntington’s capability to properly perform all technology functions necessary for its business plan, including projected growth, technology capacity, planning, operational execution, product development, and management capacity. The committee provides oversight of the technology segment investments and plans to drive efficiency as well as to meet defined standards for risk, security, and redundancy. The Committee oversees the allocation of technology costs and ensures that they are understood by the board of directors. The Technology Committee monitors and evaluates innovation and technology trends that may affect the Company’s strategic plans, including monitoring of overall industry trends. The Technology Committee reviews and provides oversight of the company’s continuity and disaster recovery planning and preparedness.The Audit and Risk Oversight Committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management. On a periodic basis, the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both, such as the construct and appropriateness of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly. All directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors.Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior, including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management, a requirement to hold until retirement or exit from the Company, a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards (50% for executive officers and 25% for other award recipients), equity deferrals, recoupment provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time.Management has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management and Risk Appetite Framework. Critically important is our self-assessment process, in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls. The segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors (e.g., credit, market, liquidity, operational, legal, compliance, reputational, and strategic) to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment. Outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process, the direction of risk, and our position compared to the defined risk appetite.Management also utilizes a wide series of metrics (key risk indicators) to monitor risk positions throughout the Company. In general, a range for each metric is established, which allows the Company, in aggregate, to operate within an aggregate moderate-to-low risk profile. Deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured exceeds desired tolerance, which may then necessitate corrective action.We also have four executive level committees to manage risk: ALCO, Credit Policy and Strategy, Risk Management, and Capital Management. Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies.18Table of ContentsHuntington utilizes three lines of defense with regard to risk management: (1) business segments, (2) corporate risk management, and (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments, segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk, elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform self-testing, and oversee the self-assessment process. Corporate Risk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits, reviews new or modified products/processes, ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments, and produces the enterprise risk assessment. The Chief Risk Officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk. Internal Audit and Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related functions are operating as intended.Risk OverviewWe, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: •Credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms; •Market risk, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital. Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income); •Liquidity risk, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the Bank’s ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value; •Operational and legal risk, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud; external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management.  Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to orders, fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from litigation, as well as regulatory actions; and •Compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry.We also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business processes and strategies and work relentlessly to protect the Company’s reputation. Strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement. Rather, we closely monitor them through processes such as new product / initiative reviews, frequent financial performance reviews, colleague and client surveys, monitoring market intelligence, periodic discussions between management and our board, and other such efforts.In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.Credit Risks:1. Our ACL level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital.Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $670 million at December 31, 2015, represented Management’s estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We periodically review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.In addition, regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the ACL and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.19Table of Contents2. Weakness in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business.Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;•A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and, thus, are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors.Market Risks:1. Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. The continuation of the current low interest rate environment or a deflationary environment with negative interest rates could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also constrict our net interest income margin which may restrict our ability to increase net interest income.Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  A decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits.  Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders’ equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments. For more information, refer to “Market Risk” of the MD&A.Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are very sensitive to rising and falling rates. Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities.The value of our MSR asset is also a function of changes in interest rates and prepayment expectations.  Declining interest rates primarily in the longer end of the yield curve reduces the value of the MSR asset. In addition to volatility associated with interest rates, the Company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from client based transactions.  20Table of Contents2. Industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success.Our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully. We operate in a highly competitive environment, and we expect competition to intensify due in part to the sustained low interest rate and ongoing low-growth economic environment. Certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do, enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits. In our market areas, we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services. Some of our non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and, therefore, may have greater flexibility in competing for business. Our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors, including customer convenience, quality of service by investing in new products and services, personal contacts, pricing, and range of products. If we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be adversely affected. In particular, if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability, or a desire to do business with our competitors, we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands, thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin.  For more information, refer to “Competition” section of Item 1: Business.Liquidity Risks:1. Changes in either Huntington’s financial condition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. The board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity.Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers. The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes (e.g. changes in FDIC insurance, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, etc.), and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical, or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits.2. If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.Wholesale funding sources include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the Bank and Corporation. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.Operational and Legal Risks:1. We face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.Our computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denial of service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, including us. None of these events against us resulted in a breach of our client data or account information; however, the performance of our website, www.huntington.com, was adversely affected, and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing our website. We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. While events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience, future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any security breach or loss.21Table of ContentsDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, nor may we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time and motive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates, terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products and applications.Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks and ""spear phishing"" attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The successful social engineer will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to its data or that of its clients.A successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breach could result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company.2. The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements updates the status of certain material litigation including litigation related to the bankruptcy of Cyberco Holdings, Inc. 3. We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders, operational errors by colleagues, business disruption, and system failures. Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third-party service providers. There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack. These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including clients, products and business practices; corporate governance; acquisitions; and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.Relative to acquisitions, we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions (including our pending acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation).  Acquisitions may be subject to, and our pending acquisition of FirstMerit Corporation is subject to, the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities, including the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the United States Department of Justice, as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire. These approvals for acquisitions may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions.  Subject to requisite regulatory approvals, future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock, which would dilute current shareholders’ ownership interests.  Additionally, acquisitions may also involve the payment of a premium over book and market values. Therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction. 22Table of Contents4. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price.5. We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes (including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process). Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses, and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.All models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information. In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading.Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.6. We rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure.  We rely on third-party service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice, provide enhanced products and services, and reduce costs. Although there are benefits in entering into third-party relationships with vendors and others, there are risks associated with such activities. When entering a third-party relationship, the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the third-party but remain our responsibility. The Technology Committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with third-party relationships.  Management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing third-party relationships. Management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships.  Increased risk could occur based on poor planning, oversight, and control and inferior performance or service on the part of the third-party, and may result in legal costs or loss of business. While we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of third-party service providers, any problems caused by third-party service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business. Replacing a third-party service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses.7. Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations.The FASB, regulatory agencies, and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards (such as the FASB, SEC, and banking regulators) may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially affect how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations.  The FASB is currently close to issuing several new accounting standards that will have significant impacts on the banking industry.  Most notably, new guidance on the calculation of credit reserves using expected losses (Current Expected Credit Losses) versus incurred losses is close to being finalized and, upon implementation, could 23Table of Contentssignificantly impact our required credit reserves.  Other impacts to capital levels, profit and loss, and various financial metrics will also result.Compliance Risks:1. Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the annual CCAR assessment process and the Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.The Federal Reserve administers the annual CCAR, an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs. Under CCAR, the Federal Reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forward-looking basis and reviews the strength of a bank holding company’s capital adequacy process. The Federal Reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatory capital ratio and above a CET1 ratio of 4.5%, after making all capital actions included in a bank holding company’s capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditions throughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. Capital plans for 2016 are required to be submitted by April 5, 2016, and the Federal Reserve will either object to the capital plan and/or planned capital actions, or provide a notice of non-objection, no later than June 30, 2016. We intend to submit our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on or before April 5, 2016. The Bank also must submit a capital plan to the OCC on or before April 5, 2016. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan, capital actions or stress test and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases.In 2013, the Federal Reserve and the OCC adopted final rules to implement the Basel III capital rules for U.S. Banking organizations. The final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. As a Standardized Approach institution, the Basel III minimum capital requirements became effective for us on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking regulators approved a final rule to implement a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, and a less stringent modified LCR requirement to depository institution holding companies below the threshold but with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The LCR requires covered banking organizations to maintain HQLA equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress scenario. We are covered by the modified LCR requirement and therefore subject to the phase-in of the rule beginning January 2016 at 90% and January 2017 at 100%. We will also be required to calculate the LCR monthly. The LCR assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types of customer deposits, which should increase the demand, and perhaps the cost, among banks for these deposits. Additionally, the HQLA requirements will increase the demand for direct US government and US government- guaranteed debt that, while high quality, generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolios.2. If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions.  In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends.  Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services. We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in the Regulatory Matters section. As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including charging monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.With the addition of the CFPB, our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions, and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and, therefore, reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, cause harm to our reputation, or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.24Table of Contents3. Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the CFPB, and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. It is not possible to predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, or the resulting rules and regulations in their entirety, will impact our business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations have and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results.4. We may become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements and activity restrictions if the Federal Reserve and FDIC determine that our resolution plan is not credible. The Dodd-Frank Act and implementing regulations jointly issued by Federal Reserve and the FDIC require bank holding companies with more than $50 billion in assets to annually submit a resolution plan to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC that, in the event of material financial distress or failure, establish the rapid, orderly resolution of the Company under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that our 2015 resolution plan is not “credible,” we could become subjected to more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions, or restrictions on our growth, activities or operations, and could eventually be required to divest certain assets or operations in ways that could negatively impact its operations and strategy.  5. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected if we lose our financial holding company status.In order for us to maintain our status as a financial holding company, we and the Bank must remain “well capitalized,” and “well managed.” If we or our Bank cease to meet the requirements necessary for us to continue to qualify as a financial holding company, the Federal Reserve may impose upon us corrective capital and managerial requirements, and may place limitations on our ability to conduct all of the business activities that we conduct as a financial holding company. If the failure to meet these standards persists, we could be required to divest our Bank, or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies.  In addition, our ability to commence or engage in certain activities as a financial holding company will be restricted if the Bank fails to maintain at least a “Satisfactory” rating on its most recent Community Reinvestment Act examination"
8,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2015-02-13,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
 Risk Governance  We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite as aggregate moderate-to-low. This does not preclude engagement in select higher riskactivities. Rather, the definition is intended to represent an average of where we want our overall risk to be managed.  Threeboard committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk appetite and monitoring of our risk profile: The Audit Committee, Risk Oversight Committee, and the Technology Committee:     The Audit Committee is principally involved with overseeing the integrity of financial statements, providing oversight of the internal auditdepartment, and selecting our external auditors. Our chief auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee Chair.      The Risk Oversight Committee supervises our risk management processes which primarily cover credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, legal,strategic, and reputational risks. It also approves the charters of executive risk management committees, sets risk limits on certain risk measures (e.g., economic value of equity), receives results of the risk self-assessment process, and routinelyengages management in review of key risks. Our credit review executive reports directly to the Risk Oversight Committee.      The Technology Committee provides oversight of technology to meet defined standards for risk, security, and Company-defined targets; and ensure thatexposure to security and redundancy risks are defined and transparent and provides oversight of the Banks overall third party relationship risk management process. The Audit and Risk Oversight committees routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and riskmanagement. On a periodic basis, the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly. All directors have access to information provided to eachcommittee and all scheduled meetings are open to all directors.  Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board ofdirectors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is risk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior, including common stockownership thresholds for the chief executive officer and certain members of senior management, a requirement to hold until retirement, or exit from the company, a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restrictedstock awards (50% for executive officers and 25% for other award recipients), equity deferrals, recoupment provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time. Management has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management and Risk Appetite Framework. Critically important is our self-assessmentprocess, in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls. The segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors (e.g., credit, market,liquidity, operational, reputational, compliance, etc.) to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment. Outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process, the direction of risk, and our position comparedto the defined risk appetite.  Management also utilizes a wide series of metrics (key risk indicators) to monitor riskpositions throughout the Company. In general, a range for each metric is established which allows the company, in aggregate, to operate within a moderate-to-low risk profile. Deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured ismoving, which may then necessitate corrective action.  We also have four other executive level committees to manage risk:ALCO, Credit Policy and Strategy, Risk Management, and Capital Management. Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature. We believe this structure helps ensureappropriate escalation of issues and overall communication of strategies.  Huntington utilizes three lines of defense withregard to risk management: (1) business segments, (2) corporate risk management, and (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments, segment risk officers have been embedded toidentify and monitor risk, elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform self-testing, and oversee the self-assessment process. Corporate Risk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits, reviews new or modifiedproducts/processes, ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments, and produces the enterprise risk assessment. The Chief Risk Officer has significant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply torisk. Internal Audit and Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related functions are operating as intended.   15 Table of ContentsRisk Overview  We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control, thoughefforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financialobligations under agreed upon terms, (2) market risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and creditspreads, (3) liquidity risk, which is (a) the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market issues, investor and customer perception offinancial strength, and events unrelated to us such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and (b) the risk of loss based on our ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments due to the mix and maturitystructure of our balance sheet, amount of on-hand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding, (4) operational and legal risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failedinternal systems and controls, including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethicalstandards, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks, and (5) compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result ofnonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry.  We also expend considerableeffort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business strategies and work relentlessly to protect the Companys reputation. Strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methodsof measurement. Rather, we closely monitor them through processes such as new product / initiative reviews, frequent financial performance reviews, employee and client surveys, monitoring market intelligence, periodic discussions between managementand our board, and other such efforts.  In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into thisreport, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially. Credit Risks:  1. OurACL level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital.  Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $666.0 million at December 31, 2014, represented Managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and leaseportfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We periodically review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as pastcharge-off experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or eventsadversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate,our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge-offs as requiredby these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  2. Weakness ineconomic conditions could materially adversely affect our business.  Our performance could be negatively affected to theextent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:     A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;     A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and     An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loansor other obligations to us.  An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults couldresult in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adversechanges in economic conditions affecting these sectors.   16 Table of ContentsMarket Risks:  1. Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have a materialadverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.  Our results of operationsdepend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interestrates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factorsbeyond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted.Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted. The continuation of the current low interest rateenvironment could affect consumer and business behavior in ways that are adverse to us and could also constrict our net interest income margin which may restrict our ability to increase net interest income. Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage andnonmortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, we continue to incur interest expense asa cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from period-to-period based on a number of factors,including the interest rate environment.  Rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixed-rate debt securities and cashflow hedging derivatives portfolio. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios, notably Tier I andTotal risk-based capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financial instruments. For more information, refer to MarketRisk of the MD&A.  Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are very sensitive to risingand falling rates. Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and theduration of mortgage-backed securities will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities investments.  Liquidity Risks:  1. Changes in either Huntingtons financialcondition or in the general banking industry could result in a loss of depositor confidence.  Liquidity is the ability tomeet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. The board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits andmanagement establishes operating guidelines for liquidity. Our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of depositsfrom consumer and commercial customers. The continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular. The availability of deposits can also be impacted byregulatory changes (e.g. changes in FDIC insurance, the Liquidity Coverage Ratio, etc.), and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits. While we make significant efforts to consider and plan forhypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding, market related, geopolitical or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits. 2. If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or havethe operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.  Wholesale funding sources includesecuritization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which provides members access to funding throughadvances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.  17 Table of ContentsCapital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the Bank andCorporation. The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time,consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions. Operational and Legal Risks:  1. We face security risks, including denialof service attacks, hacking and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure. Our computer systems and network infrastructure are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyber-attacks, such as denialof service attacks, hacking, terrorist activities or identity theft. Financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported breaches in the security of their websites or other systems, some of which have involvedsophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems, often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks andother means. Denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions, including us. None of these events resulted in a breach of our client data or account information; however, the performance of ourwebsite, www.huntington.com, was adversely affected, and in some instances customers were prevented from accessing our website. We expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future. While events to date primarily resulted in inconvenience,future cyber-attacks could be more disruptive and damaging. Hacking and identity theft risks, in particular, could cause serious reputational harm. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and we may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacksand could be held liable for any security breach or loss.  Despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, we will notbe able to anticipate all security breaches of these types, nor will we be able to implement guaranteed preventive measures against such security breaches. Persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources, time andmotive. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can originate from a wide variety of sources, including outside groups such as external service providers, organized crime affiliates,terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. These risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobile-payment and other internet-based product offerings and expand our internal usage of web-based products andapplications.  Even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise. Targeted socialengineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The successful social engineer will attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information inorder to gain access to its data or that of its clients.  A successful penetration or circumvention of system security couldcause us serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to our computers or systems or those of our customers and counterparties. A successful security breachcould result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss to us or to our customers, loss of confidence in our security measures, significant litigation exposure, and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a materialadverse effect on the Company.  2. The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effecton our results of operations for a particular period.  We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims andamount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harmto us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period. Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements updates the status of litigation concerning Cyberco Holdings, Inc. Although thebank maintains litigation reserves related to this case, the ultimate resolution of the matter, if unfavorable, may be material to our results of operations for a particular reporting period.  3. We face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss, expensive litigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets. We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorizedtransactions by employees or outsiders, or operational errors by employees. Huntington executes against a significant number of controls, a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and third party serviceproviders. There is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack. These operational risks could lead to financial loss, expensivelitigation, and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets.   18 Table of ContentsMoreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in anynumber of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect ourability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.  Relative to acquisitions,we cannot predict if, or when, we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms. We incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired institutions in a timely and efficientmanner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies.  4. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting inloss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price.  Effective internal controls overfinancial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures aremodified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal control environment could impact our ability toreport our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact our business and stock price.  5. We rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values.  Quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions, including estimating probable loan losses, measuring the fair value offinancial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable, estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations, managing risk, and for capital planning purposes(including during the CCAR capital planning and capital adequacy process). Our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions, historical analyses and correlations. These assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading tolosses, particularly in times of market distress, and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant. Additionally, as businesses and markets evolve, our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution. Even if theunderlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate, our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, bad data, misuse of data, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the modelsdesign.  All models have certain limitations. Reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based oninformation incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect, missing, or misleading information. In addition, our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face, may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization whenwe do not, or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate. If our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, we may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or otherbusiness or financial decisions. Strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable. Also, information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorlydesigned models could be inaccurate or misleading.  Banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bankholding companies in their businesses. Some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate, including distributions to our shareholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevantinformation is insufficient.  Compliance Risks:  1. Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the annual CCAR assessment process and the Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital andliquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities. The Federal Reserve administers the annual CCAR, an assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies withconsolidated assets of $50 billion or more and of the practices used by covered banks to assess capital needs. Under CCAR, the Federal Reserve makes a qualitative assessment of capital adequacy on a forward-looking basis and reviews the strength ofa bank holding companys capital adequacy process. The Federal Reserve also makes a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisory-run stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above each minimum regulatorycapital ratio and above a   19 Table of Contentstier 1 common ratio of 5% and common equity tier 1 ratio of 4.5%, after making all capital actions included in a bank holding companys capital plan, under baseline and stressful conditionsthroughout a nine-quarter planning horizon. Capital plans for 2015 were required to be submitted by January 5, 2015, and the Federal Reserve will either object to the capital plan and/or planned capital actions, or provide a notice ofnon-objection, no later than March 31, 2015. We submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on January 5, 2015. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan, capital actions or stresstest and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases. On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve voted to adopt final Basel III capital rules for U.S. Banking organizations. The final rulesestablish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the finalrule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. As a Standardized Approach institution, the Basel III minimum capital requirements became effective for us on January 1, 2015,and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.  On September 3, 2014, the U.S. banking regulators approved a finalrule to implement a minimum liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) requirement for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $250 billion or more, and a less stringent modified LCR requirement to depository institution holding companies belowthe threshold but with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The LCR requires covered banking organizations to maintain HQLA equal to projected stressed cash outflows over a 30 calendar-day stress scenario. We are covered by the modifiedLCR requirement and therefore subject to the phase-in of the rule beginning January 2016 at 90% and January 2017 at 100%. We will also be required to calculate the LCR monthly. The LCR assigns less severe outflow assumptions to certain types ofcustomer deposits, which should increase the demand, and perhaps the cost, among banks for these deposits. Additionally, the HQLA requirements will increase the demand for direct US government and US government- guaranteed debt that, while highquality, generally carry lower yields than other securities that banks hold in their investment portfolios.  2. If our regulators deem itappropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends, and increase the cost ofour services.  We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including theOCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in the Regulatory Matters section.As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. Suchactions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capitalrequirements.  With the development of the CFPB, our consumer products and services are subject to increasing regulatoryoversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumer practices, thereby increasingcosts associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumer businesses, and any requiredchanges to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, require remuneration to our customers, trigger fines or penalties, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase ourprices and therefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.  3. Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business,impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, andotherwise result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the CFPB,and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. It is not possible to predict the full extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, or the resulting rules and regulations in their entirety, willimpact our business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations have and will continue to result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do notappropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affectoperations and, in turn, financial results.   20 Table of Contents"

This does not preclude engagement in select higherrisk activities. Rather, the definition is intended to represent an average of where we want our overall risk to be managed. Two board committees primarily oversee implementation of this desired risk profile: The Audit Committee and the Risk Oversight Committee.     The Audit Committee is principally involved with overseeing the integrity of financial statements, providing oversight of the internal auditdepartment, and selecting our external auditors. Our chief auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee Chair.      The Risk Oversight Committee supervises our risk management processes which primarily cover credit, market, liquidity, operational, compliance, legal,strategic, and reputational risks. It also approves the charters of executive risk management committees, sets risk limits on certain risk measures (e.g., economic value of equity), receives results of the risk self-assessment process, and routinelyengages management in review of key risks. Our credit review executive reports directly to the Risk Oversight Committee.  Both committees are comprised of independent directors and routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accounting and risk management. On a periodic basis, the two committees meetin joint session to cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and appropriateness of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly. All directors have access to information provided to each committee and all scheduled meetings are open to alldirectors.  Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards isrisk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior, including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer andcertain members of senior management, a requirement to hold until retirement a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards (50% for executive officers and 25% for other award recipients),equity deferrals, recoupment provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time.  Management has introduceda number of steps to help ensure an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite is maintained. Foremost is a quarterly self-assessment process, in which each business segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls. Thesegment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors (e.g., credit, market, operational, reputational, compliance, etc.) to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment. Outcomes of the processinclude a determination of the quality of the overall control process, the direction of risk, and our position compared to the defined risk appetite.  Management also utilizes a wide series of metrics (key risk indicators) to monitor risk positions throughout the Company. In general, a range for each metric is established which allows the company, inaggregate, to maintain its moderate-to-low risk profile. Deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured is moving, which may then necessitate corrective action. We also have four other executive level committees to manage risk: ALCO, Credit Policy and Strategy, Risk Management, and CapitalManagement. Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate elevation of issues and overall communication ofstrategies.   14 Table of ContentsHuntington utilizes three levels of defense with regard to risk management:(1) business segments, (2) corporate risk management, and (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments, segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk,elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform self-testing, and oversee the quarterly self-assessment process. Segment risk officers report directly to the related segment manager with a dotted line to the Chief Risk Officer. CorporateRisk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits, reviews new or modified products/processes, ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments, and produces the enterprise risk assessment. The Chief Risk Officer hassignificant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk. Internal Audit and Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related functions are operating as intended. Risk Overview  We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations, many of which are outside of our direct control, thoughefforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financialobligations under agreed upon terms, (2) market risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and creditspreads, (3) liquidity risk, which is (a) the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro market issues, investor and customer perception offinancial strength, and events unrelated to us such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and (b) the risk of loss based on our ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments due to the mix and maturitystructure of our balance sheet, amount of on-hand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding, (4) operational and legal risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failedinternal systems and controls, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks, and(5) compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry. We also expend considerable effort to contain risk which emanates from execution of our business strategies and work relentlessly toprotect the Companys reputation. Strategic risk and reputational risk do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement. Rather, we closely monitor them through processes such as new product / initiativereviews, frequent financial performance reviews, employee and client surveys, monitoring market intelligence, periodic discussions between management and our board, and other such efforts. In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readers should carefully consider that thefollowing important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially.  Credit Risks:  1. Our ACL level may prove to be inappropriate or benegatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital.  Ourbusiness depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $710.8 million at December 31, 2013, represented Managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loancommitments and letters of credit. We periodically review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we consider economic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past dueloans, and NPAs. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers,industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could bematerially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge-offs as requiredby these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  2. Weakness ineconomic conditions could materially adversely affect our business.  Our performance could be negatively affected to theextent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:     A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;    15 Table of Contents   A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and     An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loansor other obligations to us.  An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults couldresult in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adversechanges in economic conditions affecting these sectors.  Market Risks: 1. Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans,securities, and other assets. This could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.  Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid oninterest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such asinflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rateenvironment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could beadversely impacted.  Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and otherassets, including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of incomerecognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However, wecontinue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly fromperiod-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  Rising interest rates reduce thevalue of our fixed-rate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfoliosimpacts regulatory capital ratios, notably Tier I and Total risk-based capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financialinstruments.  Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are very sensitive to rising and fallingrates. Generally, when rates rise, prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgage-backed securities will increase. Conversely, when rates fall, prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration ofmortgage-backed securities will decrease. In either case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities investments.  Liquidity Risks:  1. If we lose access to capital markets, we may not beable to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities. Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The Bank uses its liquidity to extend credit andto repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. The board of directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and Management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity. Wholesale funding sources include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-coredeposits, and medium- and long-term debt. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio ofhighly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity.   16 Table of ContentsCapital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the Bank and Corporation.The inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existingliquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.  2. Due to thelosses that the Bank incurred in 2008 and 2009, prior to December 31, 2013, the Bank and its subsidiaries could not declare and pay dividends to the holding company, any subsidiary of the holding company outside the Banks consolidatedgroup, or any security holder outside the Banks consolidated group, without regulatory approval. Also, the Bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits. Dividends from the Bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for the payment of dividends to ourshareholders. Under applicable statutes and regulations, a national bank may not declare and pay dividends in any year greater than its undivided profits or in excess of an amount equal to the sum of the total of the net income of the bank forthat year and the retained net income of the bank for the preceding two years, minus the sum of any transfers required by the OCC and any transfers required to be made to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock, unless the OCC approves thedeclaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount. The Banks undivided profits were in a deficit position until December 2013. We anticipate that the Bank will declare dividends to the holding company during the first half of 2014. Operational and Legal Risks:  1. The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period. We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatoryproceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Itis possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.  Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements updates the status of litigation concerning Cyberco Holdings, Inc. Although the bank maintains litigation reserves related to this case, theultimate resolution of the matter, if unfavorable, may be material to our results of operations for a particular reporting period.  2. Weface significant operational risks which could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.  We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including cyber-attack risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or outsiders, or operationalerrors by employees, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. These operational risks could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers,regulators, and the capital markets.  Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in anynumber of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect ourability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.  Relative to acquisitions,we cannot predict if, or when, we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms. We incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired institutions in a timely and efficientmanner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies.  Huntington is under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. The mostsignificant cyberattack risks that we face are e-fraud, denial of service, and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts. Loss can occur as aresult of negative customer experience in the event of a successful denial of service attack that disrupts availability of our on-line banking services. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social securitynumbers, could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals andhackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers.   17 Table of Contents3. Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impairour ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. As afinancial holding company, we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reactionto external events and developments. Any failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatoryactions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact our business and stock price.  Compliance Risks: 1. Bank regulators and other regulations, including Basel III capital standards and CCAR, may require higher capital levels, impacting our ability topay common stock dividends or repurchase our common stock.  On July 2, 2013, the Federal Reserve voted to adopt finalBasel III capital rules for U.S. Banking organizations. The final rules establish an integrated regulatory capital framework and will implement in the United States the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on BankingSupervision and certain changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under the final rule, minimum requirements will increase for both the quantity and quality of capital held by banking organizations. As a Standardized Approach institution, the BaselIII minimum capital requirements will become effective for us on January 1, 2015, and will be fully phased-in on January 1, 2019.  The Federal Reserve has issued guidelines for evaluating proposals by certain bank holding companies, including us, to undertake capital actions, such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing orredeeming stock. This process is known as CCAR. CCAR includes a quantitative examination component in which BHC-specific data is run through models developed by the Federal Reserve with the intention of estimating capital levels in a hypotheticalseverely adverse economic scenario. Capital plans for 2014 were required to be submitted by January 6, 2014. The Federal Reserve will either object to a capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection no later thanMarch 31, 2014, for plans submitted by the January 6, 2014 submission date. We submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve on January 5, 2014.  The Federal Reserve and OCC are expected to undertake these capital plan reviews on a regular basis in the future. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to ourcapital plan as part of their future capital plan reviews, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases.Although not currently anticipated, our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock may dilute existing stockholders.  2. If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for new business, constrain our ability to fund ourliquidity needs or pay dividends, and increase the cost of our services.  We are subject to the supervision and regulationof various state and Federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many ofwhich are discussed in the Regulatory Matters section. As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities andthe manner in which we manage the organization. Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certainproducts or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.  With the development of the CFPB, our consumer productsand services are subject to increasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions and litigation in the futurerelated to consumer practices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developmentsaffecting our consumer businesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices andtherefore reduce demand for our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses.   18 Table of Contents3. Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry maymaterially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us toincrease our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the CFPB,and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, or the resulting rules and regulations in theirentirety, will impact our business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, if we do notappropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations that apply to our consumer operations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affectoperations and, in turn, financial results"

We maintain a philosophy that each colleague is responsible for risk. This ismanifested by the design of a risk management organization that places emphasis on risk-ownership by risk-takers. We believe that by placing ownership of risk within its related business segment, attention to, and accountability for, risk isheightened.  Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards isrisk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior, including common stock ownership thresholds for the chief executive officer andcertain members of senior management, a requirement to hold until retirement a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards (50% for executive officers and 25% for other award recipients),equity deferrals, clawback provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time.

Credit Risks:  1. Our ACL level may prove to be inappropriate or benegatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital.  Ourbusiness depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $809.7 million at December 31, 2012, represented Managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loancommitments and letters of credit.

These conditions could result in one or more of the following:     A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;     A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and     An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loansor other obligations to us.  An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults couldresult in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adversechanges in economic conditions affecting these sectors.   15 Table of Contents3. Uncertain economic conditions in our markets could result in higher delinquencies, greatercharge-offs, and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods.  Like all financialinstitutions, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn. While beginning to improve slightly, there has been a slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint over the past several years, reflecting declining prices andexcess inventories of houses to be sold. These developments have had, and further declines may continue to have, a negative effect on our financial conditions and results of operations. At December 31, 2012, we had:     $8.3 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing 20% of total loans and leases.     $5.0 billion in residential real estate loans, representing 12% of total loans and leases.     $4.3 billion of Federal Agency mortgage-backed securities, $0.1 billion of private label CMOs, and less than $0.1 billion of Alt-A mortgage-backedsecurities that could be negatively affected by a decline in home values.      $0.4 billion of bank owned life insurance investments primarily in mortgage-backed securities. Because of the decline in home values, some of our borrowers have mortgages that exceed the value of their homes. The decline in homevalues, coupled with the weakened economy, has increased short sales and foreclosures. The reduced levels of home sales have had a materially adverse effect on the prices achieved on the sale of foreclosed properties. Further decline in home valuesmay escalate these problems resulting in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs, and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods.  Market Risks:  1. Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interestincome, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and other assets. This could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital. Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interestearning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic andinternational economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. At December 31, 2012, $4.1 billion, or 18%, of our commercial loan portfolio, and $2.5 billion, or 50%, of our residential mortgageportfolio, as measured by the aggregate outstanding principal balances, were fixed-rate loans and the remainder was adjustable-rate loans. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declininginterest rate environment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest incomecould be adversely impacted.  Changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management,and other assets, including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reductionof income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. However,we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding NALs without any corresponding interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly fromperiod-to-period based on a number of factors, including the interest rate environment.  Rising interest rates reduce thevalue of our fixed-rate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio. Any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts OCI, shareholders equity, and the Tangible Common Equity ratio. Any realized loss from these portfoliosimpacts regulatory capital ratios, notably Tier I and Total risk-based capital ratios. In a rising interest rate environment, pension and other post-retirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative OCI impacts from securities and financialinstruments.  Certain investment securities, notably mortgage-backed securities, are very sensitive to rising and fallingrates. Generally, when rates rise, the duration of mortgage-backed securities increases as prepayments of principal and interest decrease. Conversely, when rates fall, the duration of mortgage-backed securities decreases as prepayments increase. Ineither case, interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgage-backed securities investments.  Liquidity Risks: 1. If we lose access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors,and borrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.   16 Table of ContentsLiquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. TheBank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers. The Board of Directors establishes liquidity policies and limits and Management establishes operating guidelines for liquidity. Wholesale funding sources include securitization, federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements,non-core deposits, and medium- and long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program. The Bank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized withmortgage-related assets. We maintain a portfolio of highly-rated, marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reserves discount window. Capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of the Bank and Corporation. The inability to access capital marketsfunding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time-to-time, consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunisticallyretire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions.  2. Due to the losses that the Bank incurred in 2008 and2009, at December 31, 2012, the Bank and its subsidiaries could not declare and pay dividends to the holding company, any subsidiary of the holding company outside the Banks consolidated group, or any security holder outside theBanks consolidated group, without regulatory approval. Also, the Bank may not pay a dividend in an amount greater than its undivided profits.  Dividends from the Bank to the parent company are the primary source of funds for the payment of dividends to our shareholders. Under applicable statutes and regulations, a national bank may notdeclare and pay dividends in any year greater than its undivided profits or in excess of an amount equal to the sum of the total of the net income of the bank for that year and the retained net income of the bank for the preceding two years, minusthe sum of any transfers required by the OCC and any transfers required to be made to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock, unless the OCC approves the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount. The Banksundivided profits were in a deficit position throughout 2012. Since the first quarter of 2008, the Bank has requested and received OCC approval each quarter to pay periodic dividends to shareholders outside the Banks consolidated group on thepreferred and common stock of its REIT and capital financing subsidiaries to the extent necessary to maintain their REIT status. A wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary of the parent company owns a portion of the preferred shares of the REIT and capitalfinancing subsidiaries. Outside of the REIT and capital financing subsidiary dividends, we do not anticipate that the Bank will declare dividends during 2013, due to the deficit position of its undivided profits. Operational and Legal Risks:  1. The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period. We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and regulatoryproceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business prospects. Itis possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period.  Note 22 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements updates the status of litigation concerning Cyberco Holdings, Inc. Although the bank maintains litigation reserves related to this case, theultimate resolution of the matter, if unfavorable, may be material to our results of operations for a particular reporting period.  2. Weface significant operational risks which could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets.  We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including cyber-attack risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or outsiders, or operationalerrors by employees, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. These operational risks could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers,regulators, and the capital markets.  Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in anynumber of activities, including lending practices, corporate governance, and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect ourability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action.   17 Table of ContentsRelative to acquisitions, we cannot predict if, or when, we will be able to identify andattract acquisition candidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms. We incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful inretaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies.  Huntington is under continuousthreat of loss due to cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. The most significant cyberattack risks that we face are e-fraud, denial ofservice, and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts. Loss can occur as a result of negative customer experience in the event of a successfuldenial of service attack that disrupts availability of our on-line banking services. The attempts to breach sensitive customer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatorycosts to us if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because of the evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile bankingchannels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our customers.  3. Failure to maintain effectiveinternal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and preventfraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth andin reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result inregulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact our business and stock price.  Compliance Risks: 1. Bank regulators and other regulations, including proposed Basel III capital standards and capital plan reviews, may requirehigher capital levels, impacting our ability to pay common stock dividends or repurchase our common stock.  In June 2012,the FRB, OCC, and FDIC (collectively, the Agencies) issued three Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRs) that would revise and replace the Agencies current capital rules to align with the BASEL III capital standards and meet certain requirementsof the Dodd-Frank Act. Certain requirements of the proposed NPRs would establish more restrictive capital definitions, higher risk-weightings for certain asset classes, capital buffers, and higher minimum capital ratios. The proposed NPRs werein a comment period through October 22, 2012, and are subject to further modification by the Agencies, as the release of the final rules has been deferred indefinitely. See the Capital section within Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  The Federal Reserve has issued guidelines for evaluating proposalsby certain bank holding companies, including Huntington, to undertake capital actions, such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock. This process is known as the Federal Reserves Capital Plan Review. Pursuant tothose Federal Reserve guidelines, Huntington submitted its initial proposed capital plan to the Federal Reserve in January 2012. On March 14, 2012, we were notified by the Federal Reserve that it had not objected to our proposed capital actionsincluded in our capital plan. These actions included the potential repurchase of up to $182 million of common stock and a continuation of our current common dividend through the first quarter of 2013. On January 7, 2013, Huntington submittedits 2013 Capital Plan to the Federal Reserve including proposed capital actions through the first quarter of 2014.  TheFederal Reserve and OCC are expected to undertake these capital plan reviews on a regular basis in the future. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve or OCC will respond favorably to our capital plan as part of their future capital planreviews, and the Federal Reserve, OCC, or other regulatory capital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases. Although not currently anticipated, our regulatorsmay require us to raise additional capital in the future. Issuing additional common stock may dilute existing stockholders. The Federal Reserve has issued a proposed rule that, in addition to the broader Basel III capital reforms, will implement the applicationof the Federal Reserves capital plans rule, including the requirement to maintain capital above 5% for the Tier 1 Common risk-based capital ratio under both expected and stressed conditions. 2. If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our ability to competefor new business, constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends, and increase the cost of our services.   18 Table of ContentsWe are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and Federal regulators,including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC, CFPB, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in the RegulatoryMatters section. As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage theorganization. Such actions could negatively impact us in a variety of ways, including monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposingadditional capital requirements.  3. Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impacts the financial industry maymaterially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us toincrease our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price. The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis.In addition to the previously enacted governmental assistance programs designed to stabilize and stimulate the U.S. economy, recent market conditions have led to numerous programs and proposals to reform the financial regulatory system and preventfuture crises, including the Dodd-Frank Act.  The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial servicesindustry within the United States, establishes the new federal CFPB, and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which theDodd-Frank Act, or the resulting rules and regulations in their entirety, will impact our business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations will result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverseeffect on our results of operations.  With the development of the CFPB, our consumer products and services are subject toincreasing regulatory oversight and scrutiny with respect to compliance under consumer laws and regulations. We may face a greater number or wider scope of investigations, enforcement actions and litigation in the future related to consumerpractices, thereby increasing costs associated with responding to or defending such actions. In addition, increased regulatory inquiries and investigations, as well as any additional legislative or regulatory developments affecting our consumerbusinesses, and any required changes to our business operations resulting from these developments, could result in significant loss of revenue, limit the products or services we offer, require us to increase our prices and therefore reduce demandfor our products, impose additional compliance costs on us, cause harm to our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our consumer businesses. In addition, if we do not appropriately comply with current or future legislation and regulations thatapply to our consumer operations, we may be subject to fines, penalties or judgments, or material regulatory restrictions on our businesses, which could adversely affect operations and, in turn, financial results"
4,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2012-02-17,">Item 1A:Risk Factors
  Risk Governance  We use a multi-faceted approach to riskgovernance. It begins with the board of directors defining our risk appetite in aggregate as moderate-to-low. This does not preclude engagement in higher risk activities when we have the demonstrated expertise and control mechanisms to selectivelymanage higher risk. Rather, the definition is intended to represent a directional average of where we want our overall risk to be managed.  Two board committees oversee implementation of this desired risk profile: The Audit Committee and the Risk Oversight Committee.     The Audit Committee is principally involved with overseeing the integrity of financial statements, providing oversight of the internal auditdepartment, and selecting our external auditors. Our chief auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee.      The Risk Oversight Committee supervises our risk management processes which primarily cover credit, market, liquidity, operational, and compliancerisks. It also approves the charters of executive management committees, sets risk limits on certain risk measures (e.g., economic value of equity), receives results of the risk self-assessment process, and routinely engages management in dialoguespertaining to key risk issues. Our credit review executive reports directly to the Risk Oversight Committee. Both committees are comprised of independent directors and routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged in accountingand risk management.  On a periodic basis, the two committees meet in joint session to cover matters relevant to both such asthe construct and appropriateness of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly.  We maintain a philosophy that each colleague isresponsible for risk. This is manifested by the design of a risk management organization that places emphasis on risk-ownership by risk-takers. We believe that by placing ownership of risk within its related business segment, attention to, andaccountability for, risk is heightened.  Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of directors seeks to ensureits system of rewards is risk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management, creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior, including common stock ownership thresholds for the chiefexecutive officer and certain members of senior management, a requirement to hold until retirement a portion of net shares received upon exercise of stock options or release of restricted stock awards (50% for executive officers and 25% for otheraware recipients), equity deferrals, holdbacks, clawback provisions, and the right to terminate compensation plans at any time when undesirable outcomes may result.  Management has introduced a number of steps to help ensure an aggregate moderate-to-low risk appetite is maintained. Foremost is a quarterly, comprehensive self-assessment process in which each businesssegment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of its risk controls. The segment analyses are combined with assessments by our risk management organization of major risk sectors (e.g., credit, market, operational, reputational,compliance, etc.) to produce an overall enterprise risk assessment. Outcomes of the process include a determination of the quality of the overall control process, the direction of risk, and our position compared to the defined risk appetite.  12 Table of ContentsManagement also utilizes a wide series of metrics (key risk indicators) to monitor riskpositions throughout the Company. In general, a range for each metric is established that identifies a moderate-to-low position. Deviations from the range will indicate if the risk being measured is moving into a high position, which may thennecessitate corrective action.  In 2010, we enhanced our process of risk-based capital attribution. Our economic capital modelwas upgraded and integrated into a more robust system of stress testing in 2011. We believe this tool has further enhanced our ability to manage to the defined risk appetite. Our board level Capital Planning Committee will monitor and react tooutput from the integrated modeling process.  We also have three other executive level committees to manage risk: ALCO, CreditPolicy and Strategy, and Risk Management. Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in nature. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate elevation of issues andoverall communication of strategies.  Huntington utilizes three levels of defense with regard to risk management:(1) business segments, (2) corporate risk management, (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce greater ownership of risk within its business segments, segment risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk,elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform self-testing, and oversee the quarterly self-assessment process. Segment risk officers report directly to the related segment manager with a dotted line to the Chief Risk Officer. CorporateRisk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits, reviews new or modified products/processes, ensures consistency and quality assurance within the segments, and produces the enterprise risk assessment. The Chief Risk Officer hassignificant input into the design and outcome of incentive compensation plans as they apply to risk. Internal Audit and Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related functions are operating as intended. Huntington believes it has provided a sound risk governance foundation to support the Bank. Our process will be subject to continuousimprovement and enhancement. Our objective is to have strong risk management practices and capabilities.  RiskOverview  We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affect ourfinancial condition or results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk of lossdue to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2) market risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets and liabilitiesdue to changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and credit spreads, (3) liquidity risk, which is (a) the risk of loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to satisfy current orfuture commitments based on external macro market issues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to us such as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and (b) the risk of loss basedon our ability to satisfy current or future funding commitments due to the mix and maturity structure of our balance sheet, amount of on-hand cash and unencumbered securities and the availability of contingent sources of funding,(4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, or ethical standards, andexternal influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and security risks, and (5) compliance risk, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance withlaws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry.  We also expend considerable effort to containrisk which emanates from execution of our business strategies and work relentlessly to protect the Companys reputation. Strategic and reputational risks do not easily lend themselves to traditional methods of measurement. Rather, we closelymonitor them through processes such as   13 Table of Contentsnew product / initiative reviews, frequent financial performance reviews, employee and client surveys, monitoring market intelligence, periodic discussions between management and our board, andother such efforts.  In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report, readersshould carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could negatively impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows materially. Credit Risks:   1.Our ACL level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income and capital. Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. Our ACL of $1.0 billion at December 31,2011, represented Managements estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit. We periodically review our ACL for appropriateness. In doing so, we considereconomic conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past due loans, and NPAs. There is no certainty that our ACL will be appropriate over time to cover losses in theportfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile of amarket, industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the ACL is not appropriate, our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition andresults of operations.  In addition, bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may require us to increase our provisionfor loan and lease losses or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.  2.A sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business. Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent that further weaknesses in business and economic conditions have direct orindirect material adverse impacts on us, our customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result in one or more of the following:      A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;     A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us; and     An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loansor other obligations to us.  An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or defaults couldresult in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adversechanges in economic conditions affecting these sectors.   3.Uncertain economic conditions in our markets could result in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs, and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate infuture periods.  Like all financial institutions, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn.There has been a slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold. These developments have had, and further declines may continue to have, a negative effect onour financial conditions and results of operations. At December 31, 2011, we had:      $8.2 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing 21% of total loans and leases.   14 Table of Contents   $5.2 billion in residential real estate loans, representing 13% of total loans and leases.     $4.4 billion of Federal Agency mortgage-backed securities, $0.1 billion of private label CMOs, and less than $0.1 billion of Alt-A mortgage-backedsecurities that could be negatively affected by a decline in home values.      $0.3 billion of bank owned life insurance investments primarily in mortgage-backed securities. Because of the decline in home values, some of our borrowers have mortgages that exceed the value of their homes. The decline in homevalues, coupled with the weakened economy, has increased short sales and foreclosures. The reduced levels of home sales have had a materially adverse effect on the prices achieved on the sale of foreclosed properties. Continued decline in homevalues may escalate these problems resulting in higher delinquencies, greater charge-offs, and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods.  Market Risks:   1.Changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our loans, securities, and otherassets. This could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results of operations, and capital.  Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and interest paid oninterest bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such asinflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rateenvironment, net interest income could be materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could beadversely impacted.  At December 31, 2011, $2.8 billion, or 14%, of our commercial loan portfolio, and $2.6 billion, or50%, of our residential mortgage portfolio, as measured by the aggregate outstanding principal balances, was fixed-rate loans and the remainder was adjustable-rate loans. As interest rates rise, the payment by the borrower on adjustable-rate loansincreases to the extent permitted by the terms of the loan, and the higher payment increases the potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. In a declininginterest rate environment, there may be an increase in prepayments on fixed-rate loans, as borrowers refinance their mortgages at lower interest rates.  Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities, assets under management, and other assets, including mortgage and nonmortgage servicing rights. An increase in interest rates thatadversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cashflows. When we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without anyinterest income to offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of NPAs would decrease net interest income. In addition, transactional income, including trust income, brokerage income, and gain on sales of loans can varysignificantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment.  Rising interest rates reduces the value of our fixed-rate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives portfolio. The unrealized losses resulting from holding such securities and financialinstruments are recognized in OCI and reduce total shareholders equity. Unrealized losses do not negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios; however Tangible Common Equity and the associated ratios are reduced. If debt securities in anunrealized loss position are sold, such losses become realized and reduce Tier I and Total Risk-based Capital regulatory ratios. If cash flow hedging derivatives are terminated, the impact is reflected in earnings over the life  15 Table of Contentsof the instrument and reduces Tier I and Total Risk-based Capital regulatory ratios. Somewhat offsetting these negative impacts to OCI in a rising interest rate environment, is a decrease inpension and other post-retirement obligations.  If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low levels for aprolonged period, and assuming longer term interest rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest earning assets would continue to reprice downward while our interest bearing liability rates could fail todecline in tandem. This could have a material adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of operations. Liquidity Risks:   1.If we are unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, andborrowers, or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities. Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to make loansand leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by our board of directors, with operating limits set by Management. Wholesale funding sources include federalfunds purchased; securities sold under repurchase agreements, noncore deposits, and medium- and long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides funding throughadvances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.  We maintain a portfolio of securities that can beused as a secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market noncore deposits,issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reservesdiscount window.  Starting in mid-2007, significant turmoil and volatility in worldwide financial markets increased, thoughcurrent volatility has declined. Such disruptions in the liquidity of financial markets directly impact us to the extent we need to access capital markets to raise funds to support our business and overall liquidity position. This situation couldadversely affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such funds. If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable to meet customers needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition,results of operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from time to time, consider opportunistically retiring our outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common shares.This could adversely affect our liquidity position.   2.Due to the losses that the Bank incurred in 2008 and 2009, at December 31, 2011, the Bank and its subsidiaries could not declare and pay dividends to theholding company, any subsidiary of the holding company outside the Banks consolidated group, or any security holder outside the Banks consolidated group, without regulatory approval. Also, the Bank may not pay a dividend in an amountgreater than its undivided profits.  Dividends from the Bank to the parent company are the primary source offunds for the payment of dividends to our shareholders. Under applicable statutes and regulations, a national bank may not declare and pay dividends in any year greater than its undivided profits or in excess of an amount equal to the sum ofthe total of the net income of the bank for that year and the retained net income of the bank for the preceding two years, minus the sum of any transfers required by the OCC and any transfers required to be made to a fund for the retirement of anypreferred stock, unless the OCC approves the declaration and payment of dividends in excess of such amount. Due to the losses that the Bank incurred in 2008 and 2009, at December 31, 2011, the Bank and its subsidiaries could not declare and paydividends to the parent company, any subsidiary of the parent company   16 Table of Contentsoutside the Banks consolidated group, or any security holder outside the Banks consolidated group, without regulatory approval. Since the first quarter of 2008, the Bank has requestedand received OCC approval each quarter to pay periodic dividends to shareholders outside the Banks consolidated group on the preferred and common stock of its REIT and capital financing subsidiaries to the extent necessary to maintain theirREIT status. A wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary of the parent company owns a portion of the preferred shares of the REIT and capital financing subsidiaries. Outside of the REIT and capital financing subsidiary dividends, we do not anticipate that theBank will declare dividends during 2012.   3.The failure of the European Union to stabilize the fiscal condition and creditworthiness of its weaker member economies, such as Greece, Portugal, Spain, Ireland,and Italy, could have international implications potentially impacting global financial institutions, the financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the United States. Certain European Union member countries have fiscal obligations greater than their fiscal revenue, which has caused investor concern oversuch countrys ability to continue to service their debt and foster economic growth. Currently, the European debt crisis has caused credit spreads to widen in the fixed income debt markets, and liquidity to be less abundant. A weaker Europeaneconomy may transcend Europe, cause investors to lose confidence in the safety and soundness of European financial institutions and the stability of European member economies, and likewise negatively affect U.S.-based financial institutions, thestability of the global financial markets, and the economic recovery underway in the United States.  Should the U.S. economicrecovery be adversely impacted by these factors, loan and asset growth at U.S. financial institutions could be negatively affected. A return of the volatile economic conditions experienced in the U.S. during 2008-2009, including the adverseconditions in the fixed income debt markets, for an extended period of time, particularly if left unmitigated by European Union monetary policy measures, may have a material adverse indirect effect on us. (For further discussion, see the EuropeanSovereign Debt and Counterparty Exposure section within Credit Risk.)  Operational Risks:  1.The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period. We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimedin litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to us, which in turn could seriouslyharm our business prospects. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular reporting period. (For further discussion, see Note 22 of the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements.)   2.We face significant operational risks which could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and capital markets. We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk,cyber-attack risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by employees or outsiders, or operational errors by employees, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabledcomputer or telecommunications systems. These operational risks could lead to expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators, and the capital markets. Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices,corporate governance, and acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can alsoexpose us to litigation and regulatory action. Relative to acquisitions, we cannot predict if, or when, we will be able to identify and attract acquisition   17 Table of Contentscandidates or make acquisitions on favorable terms. We incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of acquired institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannotguarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies.  Huntington is under continuous threat of loss due to cyber-attacks especially as we continue to expand customer capabilities to utilize internet and other remote channels to transact business. Two of themost significant cyberattack risks that we face are e-fraud and loss of sensitive customer data. Loss from e-fraud occurs when cybercriminals breach and extract funds directly from customer or our accounts. The attempts to breach sensitivecustomer data, such as account numbers and social security numbers, are less frequent but could present significant reputational, legal and/or regulatory costs to us if successful. Our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened because ofthe evolving nature and complexity of these threats from cybercriminals and hackers, our plans to continue to provide internet banking and mobile banking channels, and our plans to develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve ourcustomers.   3.We are subject to routine on-going tax examinations by the IRS and by various other jurisdictions, including the states of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan,Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Illinois. The IRS has proposed various adjustments to our previously filed tax returns. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of all proposed and future adjustments, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse tothe results of operations in the period it occurs.  The calculation of our provision for federal income taxesis complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. In the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes. The effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretationof the relevant current tax laws. From time-to-time, we engage in business transactions that may have an effect on our tax liabilities.  During 2011, we entered into discussions with the Appeals Division of the IRS. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments, if unfavorable, may result in penalties andinterest. Such adjustments, including any penalties and interest, may be material to our results of operations in the period such adjustments occur and increase our effective tax rate. In the third quarter 2011, the IRS began its examination of our2008 and 2009 consolidated federal income tax returns. Various state and other jurisdictions remain open to examination, including Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Illinois. (For further discussion, see Note 17 of theNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements.)   4.Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial resultsor prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price.  Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulation that focuses oneffective internal controls and procedures. Such controls and procedures are modified, supplemented, and changed from time-to-time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments. Any failure to maintain, in thefuture, an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and adversely impact our business andstock price.  Compliance Risks:  1.Bank regulators and other regulations, including proposed Basel capital standards and Federal Reserve guidelines, may require higher capital levels, impacting ourability to pay common stock dividends or repurchase our common stock.  Federal banking regulators continuallymonitor the capital position of banks and bank holding companies. In July 2009, the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision published a set of international guidelines for determining   18 Table of Contentsregulatory capital known as Basel III. These guidelines, finalized in December 2010, followed earlier guidelines by the Basel Committee and are designed to address many of the weaknessesidentified in the banking sector as contributing to the financial crisis of 2008  2010 by, among other things, increasing minimum capital requirements, increasing the quality of capital, increasing the risk coverage of the capital framework,and increasing standards for the supervisory review process and public disclosure.  In 2011, the Federal Reserve issuedguidelines for evaluating proposals by certain bank holding companies, including Huntington, to undertake capital actions in 2012, such as increasing dividend payments or repurchasing or redeeming stock. This process is known as the FederalReserves Capital Plan Review. Pursuant to those Federal Reserve guidelines, Huntington submitted its proposed capital plan to the Federal Reserve in January 2012. The Federal Reserve is expected to undertake these capital plan reviews on aregular basis in the future. There can be no assurance that the Federal Reserve will respond favorably to our capital plan as part of their current Capital Plan Review, or future capital plan reviews, and the Federal Reserve or other regulatorycapital requirements may limit or otherwise restrict how we utilize our capital, including common stock dividends and stock repurchases. Although not currently anticipated, our regulators may require us to raise additional capital in the future.Issuing additional common stock may dilute existing stockholders.  The Federal Reserve has issued a proposed rule that, inaddition to the broader Basel III capital reforms, will implement the application of the Federal Reserves capital plan rule, including the requirement to maintain capital above 5% Tier 1 Common risk-based capital ratio under both expected andstressed conditions.   2.If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our ability to compete for new business,constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends, and increase the cost of our services. We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and Federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal Reserve, FDIC, SEC,Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in the Regulatory Matters section. As part of their supervisory process,which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization. Such actions could negatively impact us in avariety of ways, including monetary fines, impacting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital requirements.  3.Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impacts the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, addingcomplexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursuebusiness opportunities, and otherwise result in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price.  The U.S. Government has intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. In addition to the previously enacted governmental assistanceprograms designed to stabilize and stimulate the U.S. economy, recent market conditions have led to numerous programs and proposals to reform the financial regulatory system and prevent future crises, including the Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States, establishes the newfederal CFPB, and requires the bureau and other federal agencies to implement many new and significant rules and regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, or the resulting rules and regulations intheir entirety, will impact our business. Compliance with these new laws and regulations may result in additional costs, which could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.   19 Table of ContentsIn addition, international banking industry regulators have largely agreed upon significantchanges in the regulation of capital required to be held by banks and their holding companies to support their businesses. The new capital rules have yet to be finalized by the banking regulators, but generally are expected to increase the capitalrequired to be held, narrow the types of instruments which will qualify as providing appropriate capital, and impose a new liquidity measurement. The capital requirements are complex and will be phased in over many years. Any permanent significantincrease in our cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on the profitability of many of our products, the types of products we could offer profitably, our overall profitability, and our overall growth opportunities, among otherthings. Other potential effects could include impacting our ability to pay cash dividends and repurchase our common shares, higher dilution of common shareholders, and a higher risk that we might fall below regulatory capital thresholds in anadverse economic cycle.   "
1,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2011-02-18,">Item 1A:  Risk    Factors Risk    Governance     We use a multi-faceted approach to risk governance. It begins    with the board of directors defining our risk appetite in    aggregate as    moderate-to-low.    This does not preclude engagement in higher risk activities when    we have the demonstrated expertise and control mechanisms to    selectively manage higher risk. Rather, the definition is    intended to represent a directional average of where we want our    overall risk to be managed.     Two board committees oversee implementation of this desired risk    profile: The Audit Committee and the Risk Oversight Committee.           The Audit Committee is principally involved with overseeing the    integrity of financial statements, providing oversight of the    internal audit department, and selecting our external auditors.    Our chief auditor reports directly to the Audit Committee.           The Risk Oversight Committee supervises our risk management    processes which primarily cover credit, market, liquidity,    operational, and compliance risks. It also approves the charters    of executive management committees, sets risk limits on certain    risk measures (e.g., economic value of equity), receives results    of the risk self-assessment process, and routinely engages    management in dialogues pertaining to key risk issues. Our    credit review executive reports directly to the Risk Oversight    Committee.     Both committees are comprised of independent directors and    routinely hold executive sessions with our key officers engaged    in accounting and risk management.     On a periodic basis, the two committees meet in joint session to    cover matters relevant to both such as the construct and    adequacy of the ACL, which is reviewed quarterly.     We maintain a philosophy that each colleague is responsible for    risk. This is manifested by the design of a risk management    organization that places emphasis on risk-ownership by    risk-takers. We believe that by placing ownership of risk within    its related business segment, attention to, and accountability    for, risk is heightened.     Further, through its Compensation Committee, the board of    directors seeks to ensure its system of rewards is    risk-sensitive and aligns the interests of management,    creditors, and shareholders. We utilize a variety of    compensation-related tools to induce appropriate behavior,    including equity deferrals, holdbacks, clawback provisions, and    the right to terminate compensation plans at any time when    undesirable outcomes may result.    11Table of Contents    Management has introduced a number of steps to help ensure an    aggregate    moderate-to-low    risk appetite is maintained. Foremost is a quarterly,    comprehensive self-assessment process in which each business    segment produces an analysis of its risks and the strength of    its risk controls. The segment analyses are combined with    assessments by our risk management organization of major risk    sectors (e.g., credit, market, operational, reputational,    compliance, etc.) to produce an overall enterprise risk    assessment. Outcomes of the process include a determination of    the quality of the overall control process, the direction of    risk, and our position compared to the defined risk appetite.     Management also utilizes a wide series of metrics (key risk    indicators) to monitor risk positions throughout the Company. In    general, a range for each metric is established that identifies    a    moderate-to-low    position. Deviations from the range will indicate if the risk    being measured is moving into a high position, which may then    necessitate corrective action.     In 2010, we enhanced our process of risk-based capital    attribution. Our economic capital model will be upgraded and    integrated into a more robust system of stress testing in 2011.    We believe this tool will further enhance our ability to manage    to the defined risk appetite. Our board level Capital    Planning Committee will monitor and react to output from the    integrated modeling process.     We also have three other executive level committees to manage    risk: ALCO, Credit Policy and Strategy, and Risk Management.    Each committee focuses on specific categories of risk and is    supported by a series of subcommittees that are tactical in    nature. We believe this structure helps ensure appropriate    elevation of issues and overall communication of strategies.     Huntington utilizes three levels of defense with regard to risk    management: (1) business segments, (2) corporate risk    management, (3) internal audit and credit review. To induce    greater ownership of risk within its business segments, segment    risk officers have been embedded to identify and monitor risk,    elevate and remediate issues, establish controls, perform    self-testing, and oversee the quarterly self-assessment process.    Segment risk officers report directly to the related segment    manager with a dotted line to the Chief Risk Officer. Corporate    Risk Management establishes policies, sets operating limits,    reviews new or modified products/processes, ensures consistency    and quality assurance within the segments, and produces the    enterprise risk assessment. The Chief Risk Officer has    significant input into the design and outcome of incentive    compensation plans as they apply to risk. Internal Audit and    Credit Review provide additional assurance that risk-related    functions are operating as intended.     Huntington believes it has provided a sound risk governance    foundation to support the Bank. Our process will be subject to    continuous improvement and enhancement. Our objective is to have    strong risk management practices and capabilities. Risk    Overview     We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of    risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or    results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct    control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while    optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit    risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease    customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their    financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2) market    risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market    value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market    interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and    credit spreads, (3) liquidity risk, which is the risk of    loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to    satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro    market issues, investor and customer perception of financial    strength, and events unrelated to us such as war, terrorism, or    financial institution market specific issues, (4) operational    risk, which is the risk of loss due to human error,    inadequate or failed internal systems and controls, violations    of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed    practices, or ethical standards, and external influences such as    market conditions, fraudulent activities, disasters, and    security risks, and (5) compliance risk, which exposes us    to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a    result of nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that    apply to the financial services industry.    12Table of Contents    We also expend considerable effort to contain risk which    emanates from execution of our business strategies and work    relentlessly to protect the Companys reputation. Strategic    and reputational risks do not easily lend themselves to    traditional methods of measurement. Rather, we closely monitor    them through processes such as new    product / initiative reviews, frequent financial    performance reviews, employee and client surveys, monitoring    market intelligence, periodic discussions between management and    our board, and other such efforts.     In addition to the other information included or incorporated by    reference into this report, readers should carefully consider    that the following important factors, among others, could    negatively impact our business, future results of operations,    and future cash flows materially. Credit    Risks: 1.  Our ACL    may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit risk    exposures which could materially adversely affect our net income    and capital.     Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers.    Our ACL of $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010,    represents Managements estimate of probable losses    inherent in our loan and lease portfolio as well as our unfunded    loan commitments and letters of credit. We periodically review    our ACL for adequacy. In doing so, we consider economic    conditions and trends, collateral values, and credit quality    indicators, such as past charge-off experience, levels of past    due loans, and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that    our ACL will be adequate over time to cover losses in the    portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the    economy, market conditions, or events adversely affecting    specific customers, industries, or markets. If the credit    quality of our customer base materially decreases, if the risk    profile of a market, industry, or group of customers changes    materially, or if the ACL is not adequate, our net income and    capital could be materially adversely affected which, in turn,    could have a material negative adverse affect on our financial    condition and results of operations.     In addition, bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may    require us to increase our provision for loan and lease losses    or loan charge-offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge-offs    as required by these regulatory authorities could have a    material adverse affect on our financial condition and results    of operations. 2.  A    sustained weakness or further weakening in economic conditions    could materially adversely affect our business.     Our performance could be negatively affected to the extent that    further weaknesses in business and economic conditions have    direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us, our    customers, and our counterparties. These conditions could result    in one or more of the following:           A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and    services offered by us;           A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for    savings and investment products offered by us; and           An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who    become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or    default on their loans or other obligations to us.     An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies, or    defaults could result in a higher level of NPAs, NCOs, provision    for credit losses, and valuation adjustments on loans held for    sale. The markets we serve are dependent on industrial and    manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to    adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors. 3.  Further    declines in home values or reduced levels of home sales in our    markets could result in higher delinquencies, greater    charge-offs, and increased losses on the sale of foreclosed real    estate in future periods.     Like all financial institutions, we are subject to the effects    of any economic downturn. There has been a slowdown in the    housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting    declining prices and excess    13Table of Contents    inventories of houses to be sold. These developments have had,    and further declines may continue to have, a negative effect on    our financial conditions and results of operations. At    December 31, 2010, we had:           $7.7 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing    20% of total loans and leases.           $4.5 billion in residential real estate loans, representing    12% of total loans and leases.           $4.7 billion of Federal Agency mortgage-backed securities,    $0.1 billion of private label CMOs, and $0.1 billion    of Alt-A mortgage-backed securities that could be negatively    affected by a decline in home values.           $0.3 billion of bank owned life insurance investments    primarily in mortgage-backed securities.     Because of the decline in home values, some of our borrowers    have mortgages greater than the value of their homes. The    decline in home values, coupled with the weakened economy, has    increased short sales and foreclosures. The reduced levels of    home sales have had a materially adverse affect on the prices    achieved on the sale of foreclosed properties. Continued decline    in home values may escalate these problems resulting in higher    delinquencies, greater charge-offs, and increased losses on the    sale of foreclosed real estate in future periods. Market    Risks: 1.  Changes    in interest rates could reduce our net interest income, reduce    transactional income, and negatively impact the value of our    loans, securities, and other assets. This could have a material    adverse impact on our cash flows, financial condition, results    of operations, and capital.     Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest    income, which is the difference between interest earned on    interest earning assets (such as investments and loans) and    interest paid on interest bearing liabilities (such as deposits    and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many    factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic    and international economic and political conditions. Conditions    such as inflation, deflation, recession, unemployment, money    supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affect    interest rates. If our interest earning assets mature or reprice    more quickly than interest bearing liabilities in a declining    interest rate environment, net interest income could be    materially adversely impacted. Likewise, if interest bearing    liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning    assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest    income could be adversely impacted.     At December 31, 2010, $2.6 billion, or 13%, of our    commercial loan portfolio, as measured by the aggregate    outstanding principal balances, was fixed-rate loans and the    remainder was adjustable-rate loans. As interest rates rise, the    payment by the borrower rises to the extent permitted by the    terms of the loan, and the increased payment increases the    potential for default. At the same time, the marketability of    the underlying property may be adversely affected by higher    interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there    may be an increase in prepayments on the loans underlying our    participation interests as borrowers refinance their mortgages    at lower interest rates.     Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans,    securities, and other assets, including mortgage and nonmortgage    servicing rights and assets under management. Examples of    transactional income include trust income, brokerage income, and    gain on sales of loans. This type of income can vary    significantly from    quarter-to-quarter    and    year-to-year    based on a number of different factors, including the interest    rate environment. An increase in interest rates that adversely    affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or    interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in NPAs and    a reduction of income recognized, which could have a material    adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. When    we place a loan on nonaccrual status, we reverse any accrued but    unpaid interest receivable, which decreases interest income.    Subsequently, we continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which    is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to    offset the associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the    amount of NPAs would have an adverse impact on net interest    income.     Rising interest rates will result in a decline in value of our    fixed-rate debt securities and cash flow hedging derivatives    portfolio. The unrealized losses resulting from holding these    securities and financial    14Table of Contents    instruments would be recognized in OCI and reduce total    shareholders equity. Unrealized losses do not negatively    impact our regulatory capital ratios; however Tangible Common    Equity and the associated ratios would be reduced. If debt    securities in an unrealized loss position are sold, such losses    become realized and will reduce Tier I and Total Risk-based    Capital regulatory ratios. If cash flow hedging derivatives are    terminated, the impact is reflected in earnings over the life of    the instrument and reduces Tier I and Total Risk-based    Capital regulatory ratios. Somewhat offsetting these negative    impacts to OCI in a rising interest rate environment, is a    decrease in pension and other post-retirement obligations.     If short-term interest rates remain at their historically low    levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer term interest    rates fall further, we could experience net interest margin    compression as our interest earning assets would continue to    reprice downward while our interest bearing liability rates    could fail to decline in tandem. This would have a material    adverse effect on our net interest income and our results of    operations. 2.  The value    of our Alt-A mortgage-backed, Pooled-Trust-Preferred and Private    Label CMO investment securities are volatile and future    valuation declines or    other-than-temporary    impairments could have a materially adverse affect on our future    earnings and regulatory capital.     Continued volatility in the market value for these securities in    our investment securities portfolio, whether caused by changes    in market perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the    expected market yield of the security, or actual defaults in the    portfolio, could result in significant fluctuations in the value    of these securities. This could have a material adverse impact    on our accumulated OCI and shareholders equity depending    on the direction of the fluctuations. Furthermore, future    downgrades or defaults in these securities could result in    future classifications as    other-than-temporarily    impaired and limit our ability to sell these securities at    reasonable prices. This could have a material negative impact on    our future earnings, although the impact on shareholders    equity would be offset by any amount already included in OCI for    securities where we have recorded temporary impairment. At    December 31, 2010, the fair value of these securities was    $284.6 million. 3.  An    issuance of additional capital would have a dilutive effect on    the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect    the market price of our common stock.     We and the Bank are highly regulated, and we, as well as our    regulators, continue to regularly perform a variety of capital    analyses, including the preparation of stress case scenarios. As    a result of those assessments, we could determine, or our    regulators could require us, to raise additional capital in the    future. Any such capital raise could include, among other    things, the potential issuance of additional common equity to    the public, or the additional conversions of our existing    Series A Preferred Stock to common equity. There could also    be market perceptions that we need to raise additional capital,    and regardless of the outcome of any stress test or other stress    case analysis, such perceptions could have an adverse effect on    the price of our common stock.     Furthermore, in order to improve our capital ratios above our    already Well-capitalized levels, we can decrease the amount of    our risk-weighted assets, increase capital, or a combination of    both. If it is determined that additional capital is required in    order to improve or maintain our capital ratios, we may    accomplish this through the issuance of additional common stock.     The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or    securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or    that represent the right to receive common stock, or the    exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to    existing common shareholders. Shareholders of our common stock    have no preemptive rights that entitle them to purchase their    pro-rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series    and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in    increased dilution to existing shareholders. The market price of    our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of    our common stock or securities convertible into, or exchangeable    for, common stock in anticipation of such sales.    15Table of ContentsLiquidity    Risks: 1.  If we are    unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may    not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our    depositors, creditors, and borrowers, or have the operating cash    needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate    activities.     Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely    basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to    make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they    become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and    limits are established by our board of directors, with operating    limits set by Management. Wholesale funding sources include    federal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase    agreements, noncore deposits, and medium- and long-term debt,    which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote    program. The Bank is also a member of the FHLB, which provides    funding through advances to members that are collateralized with    mortgage-related assets.     We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a    secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of    liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources    include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to    acquire additional national market noncore deposits, issuance of    additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the    issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or    common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank    also can borrow from the Federal Reserves discount window.     Starting in the middle of 2007, significant turmoil and    volatility in worldwide financial markets increased, though    current volatility has declined. Such disruptions in the    liquidity of financial markets directly impact us to the extent    we need to access capital markets to raise funds to support our    business and overall liquidity position. This situation could    affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such    funds. If we were unable to access any of these funding sources    when needed, we might be unable to meet customers needs,    which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of    operations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying    capital. We may, from time to time, consider opportunistically    retiring our outstanding securities in privately negotiated or    open market transactions for cash or common shares. This could    adversely affect our liquidity position. 2.  Due to    the losses that the Bank incurred in 2008 and 2009, at    December 31, 2010, the Bank and its subsidiaries could not    declare and pay dividends to the holding company, any subsidiary    of the holding company outside the Banks consolidated    group, or any security holder outside the Banks    consolidated group, without regulatory approval.     Dividends from the Bank to the parent company are the primary    source of funds for the payment of dividends to our    shareholders. Under applicable statutes and regulations, a    national bank may not declare and pay dividends in any year in    excess of an amount equal to the sum of the total of the net    income of the bank for that year and the retained net income of    the bank for the preceding two years, minus the sum of any    transfers required by the OCC and any transfers required to be    made to a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock, unless    the OCC approves the declaration and payment of dividends in    excess of such amount. Due to the losses that the Bank incurred    in 2008 and 2009, at December 31, 2010, the Bank and its    subsidiaries could not declare and pay dividends to the parent    company, any subsidiary of the parent company outside the    Banks consolidated group, or any security holder outside    the Banks consolidated group, without regulatory approval.    Since the first quarter of 2008, the Bank has requested and    received OCC approval each quarter to pay periodic dividends to    shareholders outside the Banks consolidated group on the    preferred and common stock of its REIT and capital financing    subsidiaries to the extent necessary to maintain their REIT    status. A wholly-owned nonbank subsidiary of the parent company    owns a portion of the preferred shares of the REIT and capital    financing subsidiaries. Outside of the REIT and capital    financing subsidiary dividends, we do not anticipate that the    Bank will declare dividends during 2011.    16Table of ContentsOperational    Risks: 1.  The    resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable,    could have a material adverse affect on our results of    operations for a particular period.     We face legal risks in our businesses, and the volume of claims    and amount of damages and penalties claimed in litigation and    regulatory proceedings against financial institutions remain    high. Substantial legal liability against us could have material    adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm    to us, which in turn could seriously harm our business    prospects. As more fully described in Note 22 of the Notes    to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain putative class    actions and shareholder derivative actions were filed against    us, certain affiliated committees,    and/or    certain of our current or former officers and directors. These    cases allege violations of the securities laws, breaches of    fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, abuse of control,    gross mismanagement, unjust enrichment, and violations of    Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) laws in    connection with our acquisition of Sky Financial, the    transactions between Franklin and us, and the financial and    other disclosures related to these transactions. Although no    assurance can be given, based on information currently    available, consultation with counsel, and available insurance    coverage, we believe that the eventual outcome of these claims    against us will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a    material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position    or results of operations. However, it is possible that the    ultimate resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be    material to the results of operations for a particular reporting    period. 2.  We face    significant operational risks which could lead to expensive    litigation and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators,    and capital markets.     We are exposed to many types of operational risks, including    reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud    or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized transactions by    employees or outsiders, or operational errors by employees,    including clerical or record-keeping errors or those resulting    from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems.    In addition, todays threats to customer information and    information systems are complex, more wide spread, continually    emerging, and increasing at a rapid pace. Although we establish    and maintain systems of internal operational controls that    provide us with timely and accurate information about our level    of operational risks, continue to invest in better tools and    processes in all key areas, and monitor threats with increased    rigor and focus, these operational risks could lead to expensive    litigation and loss of confidence by our customers, regulators,    and the capital markets.     Moreover, negative public opinion can result from our actual or    alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending    practices, corporate governance, and acquisitions and from    actions taken by government regulators and community    organizations in response to those activities. Negative public    opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain    customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory    action. Relative to acquisitions, we cannot predict if, or when,    we will be able to identify and attract acquisition candidates    or make acquisitions on favorable terms. We incur risks and    challenges associated with the integration of acquired    institutions in a timely and efficient manner, and we cannot    guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing    customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating    efficiencies. 3.  We are    subject to routine on-going tax examinations by the IRS and by    various other jurisdictions, including the states of Ohio,    Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and    Illinois. The IRS, Ohio, and Kentucky have proposed various    adjustments to our previously filed tax returns. It is possible    that the ultimate resolution of all proposed and future    adjustments, if unfavorable, may be materially adverse to the    results of operations in the period it occurs.     The calculation of our provision for federal income taxes is    complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. In the    ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing    jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes. The    effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the    relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabilities    related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the Consolidated    Financial Statements.    17Table of Contents    From    time-to-time,    we engage in business transactions that may have an effect on    our tax liabilities. Where appropriate, we have obtained    opinions of outside experts and have assessed the relative    merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of business    transactions taking into account statutory, judicial, and    regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position.     We file income tax returns with the IRS and various state, city,    and foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been    completed through 2007. In addition, various state and other    jurisdictions remain open to examination, including Ohio,    Kentucky, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania, West Virginia and    Illinois.     The IRS and other taxing jurisdictions, including the states of    Ohio and Kentucky, have proposed adjustments to our previously    filed tax returns. We do not agree with these adjustments and    believe that the tax positions taken by us related to such    proposed adjustments were correct and supported by applicable    statutes, regulations, and judicial authority, and we intend to    vigorously defend our positions. Appropriate tax reserves have    been established in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes and    ASC 450, Contingencies. However, it is also possible that    the ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments, if    unfavorable, may result in penalties and interest. Such    adjustments, including any penalties and interest, may be    material to our results of operations in the period such    adjustments occur and increase our effective tax rate.    Nevertheless, although no assurances can be given, we believe    that the resolution of these examinations will not, individually    or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our    consolidated financial position in future periods. For further    discussion, see Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated    Financial Statements.     The Franklin restructuring in the 2009 first quarter resulted in    a $159.9 million net deferred tax asset equal to the amount    of income and equity that was included in our operating results    for the 2009 first quarter. During the 2010 first quarter, a    $38.2 million net tax benefit was recognized, primarily    reflecting the increase in the net deferred tax asset relating    to the assets acquired from the March 31, 2009 Franklin    restructuring. In the 2010 fourth quarter, we entered into an    asset monetization transaction that generated a tax benefit of    $63.6 million. While we believe that our positions    regarding the deferred tax asset and related income recognition    is correct, the positions could be subject to challenge. 4.  Failure    to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting    in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely    report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss    of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and    stock price.     Effective internal controls over financial reporting are    necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent    fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to    regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and    procedures. Management continually seeks to improve these    controls and procedures.     We believe that our key internal controls over financial    reporting are currently effective; however, such controls and    procedures will be modified, supplemented, and changed from    time-to-time    as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events    and developments. While we will continue to assess our controls    and procedures and take immediate action to remediate any future    perceived gaps, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness    of these controls and procedures on an on-going basis. Any    failure to maintain, in the future, an effective internal    control environment could impact our ability to report our    financial results on an accurate and timely basis, which could    result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence, and    adversely impact our business and stock price. Compliance    Risks: 1.  If our    regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions    that could materially adversely impact our ability to compete    for new business, constrain our ability to fund our liquidity    needs or pay dividends, and increase the cost of our    services.     We are subject to the supervision and regulation of various    state and Federal regulators, including the OCC, Federal    Reserve, FDIC, SEC, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and    various state regulatory agencies. As such, we are subject to a    wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are    discussed in the Regulatory Matters section. As part of their    supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and    18Table of Contents    continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to    impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the    manner in which we manage the organization. These actions could    impact the organization in a variety of ways, including    subjecting us to monetary fines, restricting our ability to pay    dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our    ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing    additional capital requirements. 2.  Legislative    and regulatory actions taken now or in the future to address the    current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry    may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs,    adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of    our internal business processes, negatively impacting the    recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us    to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to    pursue business opportunities, and otherwise materially    adversely impacting our financial condition, results of    operation, liquidity, or stock price.     Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial    markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and    political bodies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the    financial services industry. The U.S. Government has    intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has    been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. In addition    to the previously enacted governmental assistance programs    designed to stabilize and stimulate the U.S. economy,    recent economic, political, and market conditions have led to    numerous programs and proposals to reform the financial    regulatory system and prevent future crises.     On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law.    The Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the    financial services industry within the United States,    establishes the new federal CFPB, and requires the bureau and    other federal agencies to implement many new and significant    rules and regulations. At this time, it is difficult to predict    the extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act or the resulting rules    and regulations will impact our business. Compliance with these    new laws and regulations may result in additional costs, which    could be significant, and may have a material and adverse effect    on our results of operations.     In addition, international banking industry regulators have    largely agreed upon significant changes in the regulation of    capital required to be held by banks and their holding companies    to support their businesses. The new international rules, known    as Basel III, generally increase the capital required to be held    and narrow the types of instruments which will qualify as    providing appropriate capital and impose a new liquidity    measurement. The Basel III requirements are complex and    will be phased in over many years.     The Basel III rules do not apply to U.S. banks or    holding companies automatically. Among other things, the    Dodd-Frank Act requires U.S. regulators to reform the    system under which the safety and soundness of banks and other    financial institutions, individually and systemically, are    regulated. That reform effort will include the regulation of    capital and liquidity. It is not known whether or to what extent    the U.S. regulators will incorporate elements of    Basel III into the reformed U.S. regulatory system,    but it is expected that the U.S. reforms will include an    increase in capital requirements, a narrowing of what qualifies    as appropriate capital, and impose a new liquidity measurement.    One likely effect of a significant tightening of    U.S. capital requirements would be to increase our cost of    capital, among other things. Any permanent significant increase    in our cost of capital could have significant adverse impacts on    the profitability of many of our products, the types of products    we could offer profitably, our overall profitability, and our    overall growth opportunities, among other things. Although most    financial institutions would be affected, these business impacts    could be felt unevenly, depending upon the business and product    mix of each institution. Other potential effects could include    less ability to pay cash dividends and repurchase our common    shares, higher dilution of common shareholders, and a higher    risk that we might fall below regulatory capital thresholds in    an adverse economic cycle. "
2,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2010-02-18,">Item 1A:  Risk    Factors     We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of    risks that may adversely affect our financial condition or    results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct    control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while    optimizing returns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit    risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease    customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their    financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2) market    risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market    value of assets and liabilities due to changes in market    interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, and    credit spreads, (3) liquidity risk, which is the risk of    loss due to the possibility that funds may not be available to    satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro    market issues, investor and customer perception of financial    strength, and events unrelated to the Company such as war,    terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and    (4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss due to    human error, inadequate or failed internal systems and controls,    violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations,    prescribed practices, or ethical standards, and external    influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities,    disasters, and security risks.     In addition to the other information included or incorporated by    reference into this report, readers should carefully consider    that the following important factors, among others, could    materially impact our business, future results of operations,    and future cash flows. (1)  Credit    Risks: The    allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively    affected by credit risk exposures.     Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers.    We periodically review the allowance for loan and lease losses    for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends,    collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past    charge-off experience and levels of past due loans and    nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance    for loan losses will be adequate over time to cover credit    losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes    in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting    specific customers, industries or markets. If the credit quality    of the customer base materially decreases, if the risk profile    of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially,    or if the allowance for loan losses is not adequate, our    business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and results    of operations could be materially adversely affected. All of    our loan portfolios, particularly our construction and    commercial real estate (CRE) loans, may continue to be affected    by the sustained economic weakness of our Midwest markets and    the impact of higher unemployment rates. This may have a    significantly adverse affect on our business, financial    condition, liquidity, capital, and results of    operation.     As described in the Credit Risk discussion, credit    quality performance continued to be under pressure during 2009,    with nonaccrual loans and leases (NALs) and nonperforming assets    (NPAs) both higher at December 31, 2009, compared with    December 31, 2008, and December 31, 2007. It should be    noted that there was a 12% decline in NPAs in the 2009    fourth quarter. The allowance for credit losses (ACL) of    $1,531.4 million at December 31, 2009, was 4.16% of    period-end loans and leases and 80% of period-end NALs.    11Table of Contents    The majority of our credit risk is associated with lending    activities, as the acceptance and management of credit risk is    central to profitable lending. Credit risk is mitigated through    a combination of credit policies and processes, market risk    management activities, and portfolio diversification. However,    adverse changes in our borrowers ability to meet their    financial obligations under agreed upon terms and, in some    cases, to the value of the assets securing our loans to them may    increase our credit risk. Our commercial portfolio, as well as    our real estate-related consumer portfolios, have continued to    be negatively affected by the ongoing reduction in real estate    values and reduced levels of sales and leasing activities. Our    ACL reserving methodology uses individual loan portfolio    performance factors based on an analysis of historical    charge-off experience and migration patterns as part of the    determination of ACL adequacy. Such factors are subject to    regular review and may change to reflect updated performance    trends and expectations, particularly in times of severe    economic stress. There is no certainty that the ACL will be    adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio    because of continued adverse changes in the economy, market    conditions, or events adversely affecting specific customers,    industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer    base materially decreases, if the risk profile of a market,    industry, or group of customers changes materially, or if the    ACL is determined to not be adequate, our business, financial    condition, liquidity, capital, and results of operations could    be materially adversely affected.     Bank regulators periodically review our ACL and may require us    to increase our provision for loan and lease losses or loan    charge-offs. Any increase in our ACL or loan charge-offs as    required by these regulatory authorities could have a material    adverse effect on our results of operations and our financial    condition.     In particular, an increase in our ACL could result in a    reduction in the amount of our tangible common equity (TCE)    and/or our    Tier 1 common equity. Given the focus on these    measurements, we may be required to raise additional capital    through the issuance of common stock as a result of an increase    in our ACL. The issuance of additional common stock or other    actions could have a dilutive effect on the existing holders of    our common stock, and adversely affect the market price of our    common stock. A    sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic    conditions generally or specifically in the markets in which we    do business could adversely affect our business and operating    results.     Our business could be adversely affected to the extent that    weaknesses in business and economic conditions have direct or    indirect impacts on us or on our customers and counterparties.    These conditions could lead, for example, to one or more of the    following:           A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and    services offered by us;           A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for    savings and investment products offered by us; and           An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who    become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws, or    default on their loans or other obligations to us.     An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or    defaults could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets,    net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuation    adjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are    dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus    particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic    conditions. Declines    in home values and reduced levels of home sales in our markets    could continue to adversely affect us.     Like all financial institutions, we are subject to the effects    of any economic downturn. There has been a slowdown in the    housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting    declining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold.    These developments have had, and further declines may continue    to have, a negative effect on our financial conditions and    results of operations. At December 31, 2009, we had:           $7.6 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing    21% of total loans and leases.    12Table of Contents           $4.5 billion in residential real estate loans, representing    12% of total loans and leases. Adjustable-rate mortgages,    primarily mortgages that have a fixed rate for the first 3 to    5 years and then adjust annually, comprised 56% of this    portfolio.           $0.9 billion of loans to single family home builders. These    loans represented 2% of total loans and leases.           $4.9 billion of mortgage-backed securities, including    $3.5 billion of Federal Agency mortgage-backed securities,    $0.5 billion of private label collateralized mortgage    obligations, $0.1 billion of Alt-A mortgage backed    securities, and $0.1 billion of pooled trust preferred    securities that could be negatively affected by a decline in    home values.           $0.3 billion of bank owned life insurance (BOLI)    investments primarily in mortgage-backed securities. This    investment represents 24% of the total BOLI investment portfolio. Adverse    economic conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related    service industries may impact our banking business.     Many of the banking markets we serve are connected, directly or    indirectly, to the automobile manufacturing industry. We do not    have any direct credit exposure to automobile manufacturers.    However, we do have a modest exposure to companies that derive    more than 25% of their revenues from contracts with the    automobile manufacturing companies. Also, these automobile    manufacturers or their suppliers employ many of our consumer    customers. The automobile manufacturing industry has experienced    significant economic difficulties over the past five years,    which, in turn, has adversely impacted a number of related    industries that serve the automobile manufacturing industry,    including automobile parts suppliers and other indirect    businesses. We cannot provide assurance that the economic    conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related service    industries will improve at any time in the foreseeable future or    that adverse economic conditions in these industries will not    impact the Bank. (2)  Market    Risks: We may    raise additional capital, which could have a dilutive effect on    the existing holders of our common stock and adversely affect    the market price of our common stock.     During 2009, we issued 346.8 million shares of additional    common stock through two common stock public offerings, three    discretionary equity issuance programs, and conversions of    preferred stock into common stock. The issuance of these    additional shares of common stock resulted in a 95% increase of    outstanding shares of common stock at December 31, 2009,    compared with December 31, 2008, and those additional    shares were significantly dilutive to existing common    shareholders. (See the Capital section located    within the Risk Management and Capital section for    additional information). As of December 31, 2009, we had    130.2 million of additional authorized common shares    available for issuance, and 4.8 million of additional    authorized preferred shares available for issuance.     We are not restricted from issuing additional authorized shares    of common stock or securities that are convertible into or    exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, common    stock. We continually evaluate opportunities to access capital    markets taking into account our regulatory capital ratios,    financial condition, and other relevant considerations, and    subject to market conditions, we may take further capital    actions. Such actions, with regulatory approval when required,    may include opportunistically retiring our outstanding    securities, including our subordinated debt, trust-preferred    securities, and preferred shares, in open market transactions,    privately negotiated transactions, or public offers for cash or    common shares, as well as issuing additional shares of common    stock in public or private transactions in order to increase our    capital levels above our already well-capitalized    levels, as defined by the federal bank regulatory agencies, and    other regulatory capital targets.     Both Huntington and the Bank are highly regulated, and we, as    well as our regulators, continue to regularly perform a variety    of capital analyses, including the preparation of stress case    scenarios. As a result of those assessments, we could determine,    or our regulators could require us, to raise additional capital    in the    13Table of Contents    future. Any such capital raise could include, among other    things, the potential issuance of additional common equity to    the public, the potential issuance of common equity to the    government under the CAP, or the additional conversions of our    existing Series B Preferred Stock to common equity. There    could also be market perceptions that we need to raise    additional capital, and regardless of the outcome of any stress    test or other stress case analysis, such perceptions could have    an adverse effect on the price of our common stock.     Furthermore, in order to improve our capital ratios above our    already well-capitalized levels, we can decrease the    amount of our risk-weighted assets, increase capital, or a    combination of both. If it is determined that additional capital    is required in order to improve or maintain our capital ratios,    we may accomplish this through the issuance of additional common    stock.     The issuance of any additional shares of common stock or    securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock or    that represent the right to receive common stock, or the    exercise of such securities, could be substantially dilutive to    existing common shareholders. Shareholders of our common stock    have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase their    pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series    and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in    increased dilution to existing shareholders. The market price of    our common stock could decline as a result of sales of shares of    our common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable    for common stock in anticipation of such sales. The value    of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines    or    other-than-temporary    impairments could have a materially adverse affect on our future    earnings and regulatory capital.     Continued volatility in the market value for certain of our    investment securities, whether caused by changes in market    perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the expected market    yield of the security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could    result in significant fluctuations in the value of the    securities. This could have a material adverse impact on our    accumulated other comprehensive income and shareholders    equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations.    Furthermore, future downgrades or defaults in these securities    could result in future classifications as other than temporarily    impaired. This could have a material impact on our future    earnings, although the impact on shareholders equity will    be offset by any amount already included in other comprehensive    income for securities where we have recorded temporary    impairment. Changes    in interest rates could negatively impact our financial    condition and results of operations.     Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest    income, which is the difference between interest earned on    interest-earning assets (such as investments and loans) and    interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits    and borrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many    factors, including governmental monetary policies and domestic    and international economic and political conditions. Conditions    such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and    other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates.    If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly    than interest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate    environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.    Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more    quickly than interest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate    environment, net interest income could be adversely impacted.     Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans,    securities, and other assets, including retained interests in    securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights and    assets under management. A portion of our earnings results from    transactional income. Examples of transactional income include    trust income, brokerage income, gain on sales of loans and other    real estate owned. This type of income can vary significantly    from    quarter-to-quarter    and    year-to-year    based on a number of different factors, including the interest    rate environment. An increase in interest rates that adversely    affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or    interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in    nonperforming assets and a reduction of income recognized, which    could have a material, adverse effect on our results of    operations and cash flows. When we decide to stop accruing    interest on a loan, we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest    receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we    continue to have a cost to fund the loan, which is reflected as    interest expense, without any interest income to offset the    associated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of    loans on nonaccrual status could have an adverse impact on net    interest income.    14Table of Contents    Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither    completely predictable nor controllable, our Market Risk    Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest rate    sensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management    by establishing policies and operating limits. For further    discussion, see the Market Risk  Interest Rate    Risk section in Managements Discussion and Analysis    of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. If short-term    interest rates remain at their historically low levels for a    prolonged period, and assuming longer-term interest rates fall    further, we could experience net interest margin compression as    our interest-earning assets would continue to reprice downward    while our interest-bearing liability rates, especially customer    deposit rates, could remain at current levels. (3)  Liquidity    Risks: If the    Bank or holding company were unable to borrow funds through    access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet the cash    flow requirements of our depositors, creditors, and borrowers,    or the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and    other corporate activities.     Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely    basis at a reasonable cost. The liquidity of the Bank is used to    make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as they    become due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and    limits are established by the board of directors, with operating    limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits and    percentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding.    The Banks MRC regularly monitors the overall liquidity    position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that    various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated    events that could affect liquidity. MRC also establishes    policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Banks    wholesale funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one    market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal funds    purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core    deposits, and medium- and long-term debt, which includes a    domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank is    also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio    (FHLB), which provides funding through advances to members that    are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.     We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a    secondary source of liquidity. There are other sources of    liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources    include the sale or securitization of loans, the ability to    acquire additional national market, non-core deposits, issuance    of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances,    the issuance of debt securities, and the issuance of preferred    or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank    also can borrow from the Federal Reserves discount window.     Starting in the middle of 2007, there has been significant    turmoil and volatility in worldwide financial markets which is,    at present, moderating. These conditions have resulted in a    disruption in the liquidity of financial markets, and could    directly impact us to the extent we need to access capital    markets to raise funds to support our business and overall    liquidity position. This situation could affect the cost of such    funds or our ability to raise such funds. If we were unable to    access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be    unable to meet customers needs, which could adversely    impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash    flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, from    time to time, consider opportunistically retiring our    outstanding securities, including our subordinated debt, trust    preferred securities and preferred shares in privately    negotiated or open market transactions for cash or common    shares. This could adversely affect our liquidity position. For    further discussion, see the Liquidity Risk section. The OCC    has imposed dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank,    which could impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders    or repurchase stock. Due to the losses that the Bank incurred in    2009 and 2008, at December 31, 2009, the Bank could not    declare and pay dividends to the holding company without    regulatory approval.     The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank,    its subsidiaries, and their respective activities. Under certain    circumstances, including any determination that the activities    of the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound    banking practice, the OCC has the authority by statute to    restrict the Banks ability to transfer assets, make    shareholder distributions, and redeem preferred securities.    15Table of Contents    Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a    national bank may be paid out of current or retained net    profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash    dividend on shares of its common stock out of net profits until    the surplus fund equals the amount of capital stock or, if the    surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until    certain amounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus    fund. Moreover, the prior approval of the OCC is required for    the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared    by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total    of its net profits for the year combined with its net profits    for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to    surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred securities.     We do not anticipate that the holding company will receive    dividends from the Bank during 2010, as we build the Banks    regulatory capital levels above our already    well-capitalized level.     Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory    limitations if the Bank became under-capitalized for    purposes of the OCC prompt corrective action    regulations. Under-capitalized is currently defined    as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a    Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a    core capital, or leverage, ratio of less than 4.0%. If the Bank    were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it could    impact our ability to pay dividends to shareholders or    repurchase stock. Throughout 2009, the Bank was in compliance    with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be    well-capitalized.     For further discussion, see the Parent Company    Liquidity section. (4)  Operational    Risks: Legislative    and regulatory actions taken now or in the future to address the    current liquidity and credit crisis in the financial industry    may significantly affect our financial condition, results of    operation, liquidity, or stock price.     Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial    markets, have resulted in government regulatory agencies and    political bodies placing increased focus on and scrutiny of the    financial services industry. The U.S. Government has    intervened on an unprecedented scale, responding to what has    been commonly referred to as the financial crisis. In addition    to the U.S. Treasury Departments CPP under the TARP    announced in the fall of 2008 and the new Capital Assistance    Program (CAP) announced in spring of 2009, the    U.S. Government has taken steps that include enhancing the    liquidity support available to financial institutions,    establishing a commercial paper funding facility, temporarily    guaranteeing money market funds and certain types of debt    issuances, and increasing insurance on bank deposits. The    U.S. Congress, through the Emergency Economic Stabilization    Act of 2008 and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of    2009, has imposed a number of restrictions and limitations on    the operations of financial services firms participating in the    federal programs.     These programs subject us, and other financial institutions that    participate in them, to additional restrictions, oversight, and    costs that may have an adverse impact on our business, financial    condition, results of operations, or the price of our common    stock. In addition, new proposals for legislation continue to be    introduced in the U.S. Congress that could further increase    regulation of the financial services industry and impose    restrictions on the operations and general ability of firms    within the industry to conduct business consistent with    historical practices, including as related to compensation,    interest rates, the impact of bankruptcy proceedings on consumer    real property mortgages, and otherwise. Federal and state    regulatory agencies also frequently adopt changes to their    regulations    and/or    change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. We    cannot predict the substance or impact of pending or future    legislation, regulation, or its application. Compliance with    such current and potential regulation and scrutiny may    significantly increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our    internal business processes, negatively impact the    recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, require us to    increase our regulatory capital, and limit our ability to pursue    business opportunities in an efficient manner.     Recent legislative proposals in Congress could impact how we    assess fees on deposit accounts for items and transactions that    either overdraw an account or that are returned for    nonsufficient funds. It is uncertain    16Table of Contents    which, if any, of the changes in these proposals will be    adopted. Additionally, on November 12, 2009, the Federal    Reserve Board (the Board) issued its final rule    under Regulation E regarding overdraft fees, which becomes    effective for new accounts on July 1, 2010, and for    existing accounts on August 15, 2010. This rule generally    prohibits financial institutions from charging overdraft fees    for ATM and one-time debit card transactions that overdraw    consumer deposit accounts, unless the consumer opts    in to having such overdrafts authorized and paid. This    rule may be affected by the legislative proposals in Congress    regarding overdraft fees. Thus, although the Boards rule    will impact the amount of overdraft fees we will be able to    charge, we cannot currently predict whether either the    Boards rule or the legislative proposals in Congress will    have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. We are    subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions.    The Internal Revenue Service and other taxing jurisdictions may    propose various adjustments to our previously filed tax returns.    It is possible that the ultimate resolution of such proposed    adjustments, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of    operations in the period it occurs.     The calculation of our provision for federal income taxes is    complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. We have    two accruals for income taxes: our income tax receivable    represents the estimated amount currently due from the federal    government, net of any reserve for potential audit issues, and    is reported as a component of accrued income and other    assets in our consolidated balance sheet; our deferred    federal income tax asset or liability represents the estimated    impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our    assets and liabilities under GAAP, and how such assets and    liabilities are recognized under federal tax code.     In the ordinary course of business, we operate in various taxing    jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes. The    effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the    relevant current tax laws. We believe the aggregate liabilities    related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated    financial statements. We review the appropriate tax treatment of    all transactions taking into consideration statutory, judicial,    and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions. In    addition, we rely on various tax opinions, recent tax audits,    and historical experience.     From time to time, we engage in business transactions that may    have an effect on our tax liabilities. Where appropriate, we    have obtained opinions of outside experts and have assessed the    relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of    business transactions taking into account statutory, judicial,    and regulatory guidance in the context of the tax position.    However, changes to our estimates of accrued taxes can occur due    to changes in tax rates, implementation of new business    strategies, resolution of issues with taxing authorities    regarding previously taken tax positions and newly enacted    statutory, judicial, and regulatory guidance. Such changes could    affect the amount of our accrued taxes and could be material to    our financial position    and/or    results of operations.     The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the    U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state, city, and    foreign jurisdictions. Federal income tax audits have been    completed through 2005. In 2009, the IRS began the audit of our    consolidated federal income tax returns for the tax years 2006    and 2007. In addition, various state and other jurisdictions    remain open to examination for tax years 2000 and forward.     The Internal Revenue Service, State of Ohio, and other state tax    officials have proposed adjustments to our previously filed tax    returns. We believe that the tax positions taken by us related    to such proposed adjustments were correct and supported by    applicable statutes, regulations, and judicial authority, and    intend to vigorously defend them. It is possible that the    ultimate resolution of the proposed adjustments, if unfavorable,    may be material to the results of operations in the period it    occurs. However, although no assurances can be given, we believe    that the resolution of these examinations will not, individually    or in the aggregate, have a material adverse impact on our    consolidated financial position.     The Franklin restructuring resulted in a $159.9 million net    deferred tax asset equal to the amount of income and equity that    was included in our operating results for the 2009 first    quarter. While we believe that our position regarding the    deferred tax asset and related income recognition is correct,    that position could be subject to challenge.    17Table of ContentsIf our    regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions    that could impact our ability to compete for new business,    constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs, and increase    the cost of our services.     Huntington and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision    and regulation of various State and Federal regulators,    including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the    Federal Reserve, the FDIC, SEC, FINRA, and various state    regulatory agencies. As such, Huntington is subject to a wide    variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in    the Regulatory Matters section. As part of their    supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and    continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to    impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the    manner in which we manage the organization. These actions could    impact the organization in a variety of ways, including    subjecting us to monetary fines, restricting our ability to pay    dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our    ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing    additional capital requirements. The    resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable,    could have a material adverse affect on our results of    operations for a particular period.     Huntington faces legal risks in its businesses, and the volume    of claims and amount of damages and penalties claimed in    litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial    institutions remain high. Substantial legal liability or    significant regulatory action against Huntington could have    material adverse financial effects or cause significant    reputational harm to Huntington, which in turn could seriously    harm Huntingtons business prospects. As more fully    described in Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial    Statements, certain putative class actions and shareholder    derivative actions were filed against Huntington, certain    affiliated committees, and / or certain of its current    or former officers and directors. At this time, it is not    possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse    outcome, or reasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss    in connection with these lawsuits. Although no assurance can be    given, based on information currently available, consultation    with counsel, and available insurance coverage, management    believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against us    will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material    adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results    of operations. However, it is possible that the ultimate    resolution of these matters, if unfavorable, may be material to    the results of operations for a particular period. Huntington    faces other significant operational risks.     Huntington is exposed to many types of operational risk,    including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk    of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorized    transactions by employees or outsiders, or operational errors by    employees, including clerical or record-keeping errors or those    resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications    systems. In addition, todays threats to customer    information and information systems are complex, more wide    spread, continually emerging, and increasing at a rapid pace.    Huntington continues to invest in better tools and processes in    all key security areas, and monitors these threats with    increased rigor and focus.     Negative public opinion can result from Huntingtons actual    or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including    lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and    from actions taken by government regulators and community    organizations in response to those activities. Negative public    opinion can adversely affect Huntingtons ability to    attract and keep customers and can expose it to litigation and    regulatory action.     We establish and maintain systems of internal operational    controls that provide us with timely and accurate information    about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these    systems have been designed to manage operational risk at    appropriate, cost-effective levels. Procedures exist that are    designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics,    and business practices are followed. While we continually    monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data    processing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures,    there can be no assurance that future losses will not occur.    18Table of ContentsFailure    to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting    in the future could impair our ability to accurately and timely    report its financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss    of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and    stock price.     Effective internal controls over financial reporting are    necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent    fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to    regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and    procedures. Management continually seeks to improve these    controls and procedures.     Management believes that our key internal controls over    financial reporting are currently effective; however, such    controls and procedures will be modified, supplemented, and    changed from time to time as necessitated by our growth and in    reaction to external events and developments. While Management    will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take    immediate action to remediate any future perceived gaps, there    can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of these controls and    procedures on an on-going basis. Any failure to maintain in the    future an effective internal control environment could impact    our ability to report its financial results on an accurate and    timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of    investor confidence, and adversely impact its business and stock    price. "
15,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2009-02-24,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
     We, like other financial companies, are subject to a number of risks that may adversely affectour financial condition or results of operation, many of which are outside of our direct control,though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among the risks assumedare: (1) credit risk, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or othercounterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms, (2)market risk, which is the risk of loss due to changes in the market value of assets andliabilities due to changes in market interest rates, foreign exchange rates, equity prices, andcredit spreads, (3) liquidity risk, which is the risk of loss due to the possibility thatfunds may not be available to satisfy current or future commitments based on external macro marketissues, investor and customer perception of financial strength, and events unrelated to the Companysuch as war, terrorism, or financial institution market specific issues, and (4) operationalrisk, which is the risk of loss due to human error, inadequate or failed internal systems andcontrols, violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices, orethical standards, and external influences such as market conditions, fraudulent activities,disasters, and security risks.     In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, couldmaterially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.11Table of Contents(1) Credit Risks:The allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit riskexposures.     Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We periodically review theallowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends,collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels ofpast due loans and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losseswill be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adversechanges in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers,industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if therisk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowancefor loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and resultsof operations could be materially adversely affected.The largest single contributor to our net loss in the fourth quarter of 2008, and our reduced netincome in 2008, was $438.0 million of provision expense relating to our credit relationship withFranklin Credit Management Corporation (Franklin). This charge represents our best estimate of theinherent loss within this credit relationship. However, there can be no assurance that we will notincur further losses relating to the Franklin relationship.     We have a significant loan relationship with Franklin. Franklin describes itself as aspecialty consumer finance company primarily engaged in the servicing and resolution of performing,re-performing, and nonperforming residential mortgage loans. Franklins portfolio consists ofloans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate that generally fall outside the underwritingstandards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and involve elevated credit risk as a result of the natureor absence of income documentation, limited credit histories, higher levels of consumer debt orpast credit difficulties. Franklin purchased these loan portfolios at a discount to the unpaidprincipal balances and originated loans with interest rates and fees calculated to provide a rateof return adjusted to reflect the elevated credit risk inherent in these types of loans. Franklinoriginated non-prime loans through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Tribeca Lending Corp., and hasgenerally held for investment the loans acquired and a significant portion of the loans originated.     Through the 2008 third quarter, the Franklin relationship continued to perform and accrueinterest. While the cash flow generated by the underlying collateral declined slightly, itcontinued to exceed the requirements of the restructuring agreement. However, during the 2008fourth quarter the cash flows deteriorated significantly, reflecting a more severe than expecteddeterioration in the overall economy. Principal payments associated with the first mortgageportfolios contracted significantly as the availability of credit was further reduced. Animportant source of principal reductions had been proceeds from the sale of properties inforeclosure, so the tightening of credit standards had a direct negative impact on the cash flowsduring the quarter. In addition, interest collections declined in the Franklin second mortgageportfolio as delinquencies continued to increase. These factors, coupled with the significanteconomic downturn in the 2008 fourth quarter, further weakened Franklins borrowers ability topay, which resulted in significant deterioration in the cash flow that we expected to receive fromthese loans. As such, the changes in our estimates of the future expected cash flows led to thefollowing 2008 fourth quarter actions:  $423.3 million of our loans to Franklin were charged-off,   $9.0 million of interest income was reversed as the remaining loans were put on nonaccrual,   $7.3 million of interest swap exposure was written off, and   $438.0 million of provision expense was recorded to replenish and increase the remainingspecific loan loss reserve.     As a result of these actions, at December 31, 2008, total loans outstanding to Franklin were$650.2 million, down $444.3 million, or 41%, from $1.095 billion at September 30, 2008. Thespecific allowance for loan losses on the Franklin exposure at December 31, 2008, was $130.0million, up from $115.3 million at September 30, 2008, and represented 20% of the remaining loansoutstanding. Subtracting the specific reserve from total loans outstanding, our total net exposureto Franklin at December 31, 2008, was $520.2 million.     For further discussion concerning our exposure to Franklin, see the Significant ItemsInfluencing Financial Performance and Comparisons section included in our 2008 Annual Report toShareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference.12Table of Contents     If Franklins financial or operating condition were to deteriorate further, we haveestablished alternatives for loan servicing. In the event of default by Franklin, we can terminateservicing responsibilities and appoint a successor servicer. Franklin would be contractuallyobligated to cooperate with us and incur the costs of transferring all documents, files, andbalances to the successor.     We do not control Franklin, and Franklins ability to collect payments of principal andinterest on its loans and other recoveries from its real estate assets depends upon the efforts ofits own employees and third-party servicers hired by it. Franklin, like other residential mortgagelenders, is likely to be materially adversely affected by further declines in home prices anddisruptions in credit markets in many locales across the United States.A sustained weakness or weakening in business and economic conditions generally or specifically inthe markets in which we do business could adversely affect our business and operating results.     Our business could be adversely affected to the extent that weaknesses in business andeconomic conditions have direct or indirect impacts on us or on our customers and counterparties.These conditions could lead, for example, to one or more of the following:  A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us;   A decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investmentproducts offered by us; and   An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, filefor protection under bankruptcy laws, or default on their loans or other obligations to us.     An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higherlevel of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses, and valuationadjustments on loans held for sale. The markets we serve are dependent, indirectly, on industrialbusinesses and thus particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in theseregions.Our commercial real estate loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-goingcorrection in residential real estate prices and reduced levels of home sales.     At December 31, 2008, we had $10.1 billion of commercial real estate loans, including $1.6billion of loans to builders of single family homes. There continues to be a general slowdown inthe housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices and excessinventories of houses to be sold. As a result, home builders have shown signs of financialdeterioration. We expect the home builder market to continue to be volatile and anticipatecontinued pressure on the home builder segment in the coming months. As we continue our on-goingportfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the current conditions ofthe borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the slow down in thehousing market continues, we could experience higher charge-offs and delinquencies in thisportfolio.Declines in home values and reduced levels of home sales in our markets could continue to adverselyaffect us.     Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn. There has been aslowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices andexcess inventories of houses to be sold. These developments have had, and further declines maycontinue to have, a negative effect on our financial conditions and results of operations. AtDecember 31, 2008, we had:  $7.6 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing 18% of total loans andleases.   $4.8 billion in residential real estate loans, representing 12% of total loansand leases. Adjustable-rate mortgages, primarily mortgages that have a fixed ratefor the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually, comprised 63% of thisportfolio.   $1.6 billion of loans to single family home builders, including loans made toboth middle market and small business home builders. These loans represented 4% oftotal loans and leases.   $0.7 billion of loans to Franklin, net of amounts charged-off, substantially allof which is secured by and ultimately reflects exposures to residential real estateloans. These loans represented 2% of total loans and leases.13Table of Contents  $2.1 billion of mortgage-backed securities, including $1.6 billion of Federal Agencymortgage-backed securities, $0.5 billion of private label collateralized mortgageobligations, $0.3 billion of Alt-A mortgage backed securities, and $0.1 billion ofpooled trust preferred securities that could be negatively affected by a decline inhome values.Adverse economic conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related service industries mayimpact our banking business.     Many of the banking markets we serve are dependent, directly or indirectly, on the automobilemanufacturing industry. We do not have any direct credit exposure toautomobile manufacturers. However,  we dohave $288 million of exposure to companies that derive more than25% of their revenues from contracts with the automobilemanufacturing companies. Also, these automobile manufacturersor their suppliers employ many of our consumer customers. The automobile manufacturing industryhas experienced significant economic difficulties over the past five years, which, in turn, hasadversely impacted a number of related industries that serve the automobile manufacturing industry,including automobile parts suppliers and other indirect businesses. We cannot provide assurancethat the economic conditions in the automobile manufacturing and related service industries willimprove at any time in the foreseeable future or that adverse economic conditions in theseindustries will not impact the Bank.We could experience losses on residual values related to our automobile lease portfolio.     Inherently, automobile lease portfolios are subject to residual risk, which arises when themarket price of the leased vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the estimated residualvalue at the time the lease is originated. This situation arises due to a decline in used carmarket values. A reduction in the expected proceeds from the residual values of our directfinancing leases would result in an immediate recognition of impairment on the lease whereas areduction in the expected proceeds from the residual values of our operating leases would result inan increase in the depreciation of our operating lease assets over the remaining term of the lease.For further discussion about our management of lease residual risk, see the Lease Residual Risksection of Managements Discussion and Analysis of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portionsof which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.(2) Market Risks:If our stock price declines from levels at December 31, 2008, we will evaluate our goodwillbalances for impairment, and if the values of our businesses have declined, we could recognize animpairment charge for our goodwill.     We performed interim evaluations of our goodwill balances at June 30, 2008, and December 31,2008, and an annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, 2008. Based on our analyses, weconcluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded the fair value of our assets andliabilities and, therefore, goodwill was not considered impaired at any of those dates. Thevaluation of each of these lines of business included determining the value of the assets andliabilities we currently own, as well as an estimate of the future earnings that we expect fromeach line of business. To validate our evaluation of the values of our businesses, we reconcilethe aggregate values of our lines of business to our total market capitalization, allowing for anappropriate control premium, typically in a range of 20% to 50%. The estimated control premium wasdetermined by a review of premiums paid for similar companies over the past five years. It ispossible that our assumptions and conclusions regarding the valuation of our lines of businesscould change adversely, which could result in the recognition of impairment for our goodwill, whichcould have a material effect on our financial position and future results of operations.The value of certain investment securities is volatile and future declines or other-than-temporaryimpairments could materially adversely affect our future earnings and regulatory capital.     Continued volatility in the market value for certain of our investment securities, whethercaused by changes in market perceptions of credit risk, as reflected in the expected market yield ofthe security, or actual defaults in the portfolio could result in significant fluctuations in thevalue of the securities. This could have a material adverse impact on our accumulated othercomprehensive loss and shareholders equity depending on the direction of the fluctuations.Furthermore, future downgrades or defaults in these securities could result in futureclassifications as other than temporarily impaired. This could have a material impact on ourfuture earnings, although the  impact on shareholders equitywill be offset by any amount already includedin other comprehensive income for securities where we have recorded temporary impairment.14Table of ContentsChanges in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results ofoperations.     Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the differencebetween interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and directfinancing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits andborrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetarypolicies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such asinflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may alsoaffect interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly thaninterest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could beadversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly thaninterest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could beadversely impacted.     Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, securities, and other assets,including retained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights andassets under management. A portion of our earnings results from transactional income. Examples oftransactional income include trust income, brokerage income, gain on sales of loans and other realestate owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-yearbased on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase ininterest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest onloans and leases may lead to an increase in nonperforming assets and a reduction of incomerecognized, which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cashflows. When we decide to stop accruing interest on a loan, we reverse any accrued but unpaidinterest receivable, which decreases interest income. Subsequently, we continue to have a cost tofund the loan, which is reflected as interest expense, without any interest income to offset theassociated funding expense. Thus, an increase in the amount of loans on nonaccrual status couldhave an adverse impact on net interest income.     Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable norcontrollable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest ratesensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies andoperating limits. For further discussion, see the Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk sectionincluded in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 tothis report, and incorporated by reference. If short-term interest rates remain at theirhistorically low levels for a prolonged period, and assuming longer-term interest rates fallfurther, we could experience net interest margin compression as our interest-earning assets wouldcontinue to reprice downward while our interest-bearing liability rates, especially customerdeposit rates, could remain at current levels.(3) Liquidity Risks:If the Bank or holding company were unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, wemay not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors,creditors, and borrowers, or theoperating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities.     Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Theliquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as theybecome due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the boardof directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits andpercentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Banks MRC regularly monitorsthe overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that variousalternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC alsoestablishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Banks wholesale funding sources toavoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal fundspurchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- andlong-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank isalso a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio (FHLB), which provides fundingthrough advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.     We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity.There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources includethe sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-coredeposits, issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance ofdebt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or privatetransactions. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reserves discount window.15Table of Contents     Starting in the middle of 2007, there has been significant turmoil and volatility in worldwidefinancial markets which is, at present, ongoing. These conditions have resulted in a disruption inthe liquidity of financial markets, and could directly impact us to the extent we need to accesscapital markets to raise funds to support our business and overall liquidity position. Thissituation could affect the cost of such funds or our ability to raise such funds.If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unable tomeet customers needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations,cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. We may, fromtime to time, consider opportunistically retiring our outstandingsecurities, including our subordinated debt, trust preferredsecurities and preferred shares in privately negotiated or openmarket transactions for cash or common shares. For further discussion, see the LiquidityRisk section included in our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed asexhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negativelyimpacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could beadversely impacted. The Bank has issued letters of credit that support $500 million of notes andbonds issued by our customers. The majority of the bonds have been sold by The HuntingtonInvestment Company, our broker-dealer subsidiary. A downgrade in the Banks short term ratingmight influence some of the bond investors to put the bonds back to the remarketing agent. Afailure to remarket would require the Bank to obtain funding for the amount of notes and bonds thatcannot be remarketed.     Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of ourliquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength,credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings,capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availabilityof a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broadarray of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negativechange in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, butalso the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet arrangementscontain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs should a negative rating changeoccur. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateralagreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions.     Credit ratings as of February 13, 2009, for the parent company and the Bank can be found inTable 40 of Managements Discussion and Analysis of our 2008 Annual Report to Shareholders,portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated by reference.     We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits,federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied tocredit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes incredit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger arequirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding borrowings. Credit ratingdowngrades could result in a loss of equity investor confidence.The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which could impact ourability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Due to the significant loss that theBank incurred in the fourth quarter of 2008, at December 31, 2008, the Bank could not declare andpay dividends to the holding company without regulatory approval.     The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and theirrespective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activitiesof the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has theauthority by statute to restrict the Banks ability to transfer assets, make shareholderdistributions, and redeem preferred securities.     Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out ofcurrent or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividendon shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount ofcapital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certainamounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of theOCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a nationalbank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with itsnet profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for theretirement of any preferred securities.16Table of Contents     We do not anticipate that the holding company will receive dividends from the Bank during2009, as we build the Banks regulatory capital levels above ouralready well-capitalized level.     Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank becameunder-capitalized for purposes of the OCC prompt corrective action regulations.Under-capitalized is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio ofless than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it could impactour ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2008, the Bank was incompliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be well-capitalized.     For further discussion, see the Parent Company Liquidity section included in our 2008 AnnualReport to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, andincorporated by reference.(4) Operational Risks:If our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could impact ourability to compete for new business, constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs, andincrease the cost of our services.     Huntington and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of various Stateand Federal regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FederalReserve, the FDIC, SEC, FINRA, and various state regulatory agencies. As such, Huntington issubject to a wide variety of laws and regulations, many of which are discussed in the RegulatoryMatters section. As part of their supervisory process, which includesperiodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to imposerestrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we manage the organization.These actions could impact the organization in a variety of ways, including subjecting us tomonetary fines, restricting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions,limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capitalrequirements.The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverseaffect on our results of operations for a particular period.     Huntington faces legal risks in its businesses, and the volume of claims and amount of damagesand penalties claimed in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial institutionsremain high. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Huntington couldhave material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Huntington, whichin turn could seriously harm Huntingtons business prospects. As more fully described in Note 21of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our 2008 Annual Report toShareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference, three putative class actions and three shareholder derivative action were filed againstHuntington, certain affiliated committees, and / or certain of its current or former officers anddirectors from December 2007 through February 2008 related to Huntingtons transactions withFranklin and the financial disclosures relating to such transactions and, in one case, Huntingtonstock being offered as an investment in a Huntington employee benefit plan. At this time, it isnot possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, or reasonably estimatethe amount of any potential loss in connection with these lawsuits. Although no assurance can begiven, based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, and available insurancecoverage, management believes that the eventual outcome of these claims against us will not,individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financialposition or results of operations. However, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of thesematters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular period.17Table of ContentsHuntington faces significant operational risk.     Huntington is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legaland compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorizedtransactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors orthose resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative publicopinion can result from Huntingtons actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities,including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken bygovernment regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative publicopinion can adversely affect Huntingtons ability to attract and keep customers and can expose itto litigation and regulatory action.     We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timelyand accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systemshave been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Proceduresexist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practicesare followed. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, dataprocessing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance thatfuture losses will not occur.Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impairour ability to accurately and timely report its financial results or prevent fraud, resulting inloss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and stock price.     Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliablefinancial reports and prevent fraud. As a financial holding company, we are subject to regulationthat focuses on effective internal controls and procedures. Management continually seeks to improvethese controls and procedures.     Management believes that our key internal controls over financial reporting are currentlyeffective; however, such controls and procedures will be modified, supplemented, and changed fromtime to time as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments.While Management will continue to assess our controls and procedures and take immediate action toremediate any future perceived gaps, there can be no guarantee of the effectiveness of thesecontrols and procedures on an on-going basis. Any failure to maintain in the future an effectiveinternal control environment could impact our ability to report its financial results on anaccurate and timely basis, which could result in regulatory actions, loss of investor confidence,and adversely impact its business and stock price.18Table of Contents"
3,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2008-02-26,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
     Like other financial companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which areoutside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizingreturns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk that loan andlease customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations,(2) market risk, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adverselyaffect our financial condition or results of operations, (3) liquidity risk, which is therisk that the parent company and/or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meetits operating needs, and (4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting frominadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events.     In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, couldmaterially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.(1) Credit Risks:The largest single contributor to our net loss in the fourth quarter of 2007, and our reduced netincome in 2007 as compared with 2006, was $405.8 million in charge-offs and special reservesrelating to our credit relationship with Franklin Credit Management Corporation (Franklin). Thischarge represents our best estimate of the inherent loss within this credit relationship. However,there can be no assurance that we will not incur further losses relating to the Franklinrelationship.     As a result of our acquisition of Sky Financial, we have a significant loan relationship withFranklin. Franklin describes itself as a specialty consumer finance company primarily engaged inthe servicing and resolution of performing, re-performing, and non-performing residential mortgageloans. Franklins portfolio consists of loans secured by 1-4 family residential real estate thatgenerally fall outside the underwriting standards of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and involveelevated credit risk as a result of the nature or absence of income documentation, limited credithistories, higher levels of consumer debt or past credit difficulties. Franklin purchased theseloan portfolios at a discount to the unpaid principal balances and originated loans with interestrates and fees calculated to provide a rate of return adjusted to reflect the elevated credit riskinherent in these types of loans. Franklin originated10Table of Contentsnonprime loans through its wholly-owned subsidiary,Tribeca Lending Corp., and has generally held for investment the loans acquired and a significant portion ofthe loans originated. In its Current Report on Form 8-K, filedNovember 15, 2007, Franklin announced a delay in the filing of its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q forthe fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2007. In the November 15, 2007 Form 8-K, Franklin stated that due to the rapidly deteriorating realestate and mortgage origination credit market and resulting increased delinquencies industry widein mortgages originated in the years 2005 and 2006, particularly for second-lien loans, Franklinwas in the process of reviewing and assessing its reserves for its portfolio of acquired loans,particularly second-lien mortgage loans acquired in those years. Franklin stated that this creditreview would result in a substantial increase in the provision for loan losses for the quarterended September 30, 2007, again particularly for its portfolio of second-lien loans. In its Current Report on Form 8-K, filedFebruary 6, 2008, Franklin announced that while they previously believed that the reassessment would be complete on orbefore January 31, 2008, the reassessment and related accountants review have not yet beencompleted. Franklin stated on February 5, 2008, that it expects that it will complete the reassessment in time to file its2007 third quarter Form 10-Q on or before March 31, 2008.Franklin also stated on February 5, 2008, that it expects to file its Annual Reporton Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2007, on or before March 31, 2008. AtDecember 31, 2007, following the troubled debt restructuring of our loans to Franklin, we had $1.2billion of loans to Franklin, net of the amounts charged-off. For further discussion concerningour exposure to Franklin, see the Significant Items Influencing Financial Performance and Comparisonssection included in our 2007 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of which are filed as exhibit 13.1 tothis report, and incorporated by reference.      If wewere to assume the assets of Franklin, it is possible that we would report higher levels ofnon-performing loans and charge-offs and while we could report higher levels of interest incomefrom these loans, lower levels of earnings than currently expectedcould result. If Franklins financial or operating conditionwere to deteriorate, we have established alternatives for loan servicing so that we should not be materially impacted if Franklin wereunable to service loans. In the event of default by Franklin, we can terminate servicingresponsibilities and appoint a successor servicer. Franklin would be contractually obligated tocooperate with us and incur the costs of transferring all documents, files, and balances to thesuccessor. Franklins recent actions have not resulted in an event of default under any of itsagreements with us.     We do not control Franklin, and Franklins ability to collect payments of principal andinterest on its loans and other recoveries from its real estate assets depends upon the efforts ofits own employees and third-party servicers hired by it. Franklin, like other residential mortgagelenders, is likely to be affected by the declines in home prices and disruptions in credit marketsin many locales across the United States.Our commercial real estate loan portfolio has and will continue to be affected by the on-goingcorrection in residential real estate prices and reduced levels of home sales.     At December 31, 2007, we had $9.2 billion of commercial real estate loans, including $1.5billion of loans to builders of single family homes. Therehas been a general slowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflectingdeclining prices and excess inventories of houses to be sold, particularly impacting borrowers inour eastern Michigan and northern Ohio markets. As a result, home builders have shown signs offinancial deterioration. We expect the home builder market to continue to be volatile andanticipate continued pressure on the home builder segment in the coming months. As we continue ouron-going portfolio monitoring, we will make credit and reserve decisions based on the currentconditions of the borrower or project combined with our expectations for the future. If the slow down in the housing market continues, we could experience higher charge-offs anddelinquencies in this portfolio.Declines in home values and reduced levels of home sales in our markets could continue to adverselyaffect us.     Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn. There has been aslowdown in the housing market across our geographic footprint, reflecting declining prices andexcess inventories of houses to be sold, particularly in the eastern Michigan and northern Ohiomarkets. These developments have had, and further declines may continue to have, a negative effecton our financial condition and results of operations. At December 31, 2007, we had:  $7.3 billion of home equity loans and lines, representing 18% of total loans and leases.   $5.4 billion in residential real estate loans, representing 14% of total loans andleases. Adjustable-rate mortgages,primarily mortgages that have a fixed rate for the first 3 to 5 years and thenadjust annually, comprised 61% of this portfolio.    $1.5 billion of loans to single family home builders, including loans made toboth middle market and small business home builders. These loans represented 4% oftotal loans and leases.   $1.2 billion of loans to Franklin, net of amounts charged-off, substantially allof which is secured by and ultimately reflects exposures to residential real estateloans. These loans represented 3% of total loans and leases.   $2.9 billion of mortgage-backed securities, including $1.6 billion of Federal Agencymortgage-backed securities and $0.8 billion of private label collateralized mortgageobligations with a weighted-average credit rating of AAA, that could be negativelyaffected by a decline in home values.     Continuing declines in home values are likely to lead to higher charge-offs and delinquenciesin each of these portfolios as compared to the pre-July 2007 historical levels.The allowance for loan losses may prove inadequate or be negatively affected by credit riskexposures.     Our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We periodically review theallowance for loan and lease losses for adequacy considering economic conditions and trends,collateral values and credit quality indicators, including past charge-off experience and levels ofpast due loans and nonperforming assets. There is no certainty that the allowance for loan losseswill be adequate over time to cover credit losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adversechanges in the economy, market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers,industries or markets. If the credit quality of the customer base materially decreases, if therisk profile of a market, industry or group of customers changes materially, or if the allowancefor loan losses is not adequate, our business, financial condition, liquidity, capital, and resultsof operations could be materially adversely affected.11Table of Contents(2) Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results ofoperations.     Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the differencebetween interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and directfinancing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits andborrowings).

A portion of our earnings results from transactional income.An example of this type of transactional income is gain on sales of loans and other real estateowned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based ona number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in interestrates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans andleases may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized, whichcould have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.

A downgrade in the Banks short term ratingmight influence some of the bond investors to put the bonds back to the remarketing agent. Afailure to remarket would require the Bank to obtain funding for the amount of notes and bonds thatcannot be remarketed.     As a result of credit deterioration related to our lending relationship with Franklin, and ourrelated 2007 fourth quarter restructuring of that lending relationship, each of Moodys InvestorsService (Moodys), Standard and Poors, and Fitch Ratings (Fitch) changed their outlook for ourratings from stable to negative, Moodys placed all ratings on review for possible downgrade, andFitch downgraded our ratings on our senior unsecured notes and subordinated notes by one grade.That downgrade, and potential future downgrades in our credit ratings, whether relating to creditconcerns, including our Franklin exposure, or other considerations, could limit our access to thecapital markets, will increase the cost of our debt, and could adversely affect our liquidity andfinancial position.     Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of ourliquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength,credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings,capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availabilityof a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broadarray of wholesale funding sources.

Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Huntington couldhave material adverse financial effects or cause significant reputational harm to Huntington, whichin turn could seriously harm Huntingtons business prospects. As more fully described in Item 3 ofthis Form 10-K, three putative class actions and one shareholder derivative action were filedagainst Huntington, certain affiliated committees, and / or certain of its current or formerofficers and directors in December 2007 through February 2008 related to Huntingtons transactionswith Franklin and the financial disclosures relating to such transactions and, in one case,Huntington stock being offered as an investment in a Huntington employee benefit plan. At thisearly stage, it is not possible for management to assess the probability of an adverse outcome, orreasonably estimate the amount of any potential loss in connection with these lawsuits. Althoughno assurance can be given, based on information currently available, consultation with counsel, andavailable insurance coverage, management believes that the eventual outcome of these claims againstus will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidatedfinancial position or results of operations. It is possible that the ultimate resolution of thesematters, if unfavorable, may be material to the results of operations for a particular period.Huntington faces significant operational risk.     Huntington is exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legaland compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, unauthorizedtransactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or record-keeping errors orthose resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems. Negative publicopinion can result from Huntingtons actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities,including lending practices, corporate governance and acquisitions and from actions taken bygovernment regulators and community organizations in response to those activities. Negative publicopinion can adversely affect Huntingtons ability to attract and keep customers and can expose itto litigation and regulatory action.     We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timelyand accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systemshave been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Proceduresexist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practicesare followed. While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, dataprocessing systems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance thatfuture losses will not occur.14Table of Contents"
16,HBAN,HUNTINGTON BANCSHARES,2007-02-22,">Item 1A: Risk Factors
     Like other financial companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which areoutside of our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizingreturns. Among the risks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk that loan andlease customers or other counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations,(2) market risk, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adverselyaffect our financial condition or results of operation, (3) liquidity risk, which is therisk that the parent company and/or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meetits operating needs, and (4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting frominadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or external events.     In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, couldmaterially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.(1) Credit Risks:We extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and judgment. Wemanage the credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain creditdecisions, and an on-going process of assessment of the quality of the credit already extended. Ourcredit standards and on-going process of credit assessment might not protect us from significantcredit losses.     We take credit risk by virtue of making loans and leases, purchasing non-governmentalsecurities, extending loan commitments and letters of credit, and being counterparties tooff-balance sheet financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.     Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standardsthat emphasize in-market lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well asexcessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit administration function employs riskmanagement techniques to ensure that loans and leases adhere to corporate policy and problem loansand leases are promptly identified. These procedures provide us with the information necessary toimplement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions.     For further discussion about our management of credit risk, see the Credit Risk sectionincluded in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of whichare filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference.Our loans, leases, and deposits are focused in five states and adverse economic conditions in thosestates, in particular, could negatively impact results from operations, cash flows, and financialcondition.     Concentration of credit risk can also arise with respect to loans and leases when theborrowers are located in the same geographical region. Our customers with loan and/or depositbalances at December 31, 2006, were11 located predominantly in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia, Indiana, and Kentucky. Because of theconcentration of loans, leases, and deposits in these states, in the event of adverse economicconditions in these states, we could experience more difficulty in attracting deposits andexperience higher rates of loss and delinquency on our loans and leases than if the loans andleases were more geographically diversified. Adverse economic conditions and other factors, such aspolitical or business developments or natural hazards that may affect these states, may reducedemand for credit or fee-based products and could negatively affect real estate and othercollateral values, interest rate levels, and the availability of credit to refinance loans at orprior to maturity.Declines in home values in our markets could adversely impact results from operations.     Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn, and in particular, asignificant decline in home values in our markets could have a negative effect on results ofoperations. At December 31, 2006, we had $4.9 billion of home equity loans and lines with aweighted average loan-to-value ratio for the portfolio of 77%. In addition, at December 31, 2006,we had $4.5 billion in residential real estate loans. Adjustable-rate mortgages, primarilymortgages that have a fixed rate for the first 3 to 5 years and then adjust annually, comprised 54%of this portfolio. A significant decline in home values could lead to higher charge-offs in eventof default in both the home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios. We also have$1.3 billion of mortgage-backed securities that could be negatively affected by a decline in homevalues.(2) Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results ofoperations.     Our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income, which is the differencebetween interest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and directfinancing leases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits andborrowings). Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetarypolicies and domestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such asinflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may alsoaffect interest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly thaninterest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could beadversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly thaninterest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could beadversely impacted.     Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, includingretained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights, and our abilityto realize gains on the sale of assets. A portion of our earnings result from transactional income.An example of this type of transactional income is gain on sales of loans and other realestate owned. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-yearbased on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase ininterest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest onloans and leases may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of incomerecognized, which could have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cashflows. For further discussion, see Note 5 of the Notes toConsolidated Financial Statements included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of whichare filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference.     Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable norcontrollable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest ratesensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies andoperating limits. For further discussion, see the Interest Rate Risk section included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of whichare filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference.(3) Liquidity Risks:If we are unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet thecash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or meet the operating cash needs to fundcorporate expansion and other activities.     Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Theliquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as theybecome due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the boardof directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits andpercentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Banks MRC regularly monitorsthe overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that12 various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affectliquidity. MRC also establishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Banks wholesalefunding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources includeFederal funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, andmedium- and long-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. TheBank is also a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, Ohio (FHLB), which providefunding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.      We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity.There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources includethe sale or securitization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-coredeposits, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuanceof debt securities, and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or privatetransactions. The Bank also can borrow from the Federal Reserves discount window.     If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unableto meet customers needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results ofoperations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see theLiquidity Risk section included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of whichare filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference.If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negativelyimpacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could beadversely impacted.     Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of ourliquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength,credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings,capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availabilityof a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broadarray of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negativechange in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, butalso the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet arrangementscontain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs should a negative rating changeoccur. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateralagreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions.     Credit ratings as of December 31, 2006, for the parent company and the Bank can be found inTable 27 included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of whichare filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference.     We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits,federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied tocredit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes incredit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger arequirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstanding borrowings. Credit ratingdowngrades could result in a loss of equity investor confidence.We have authorized the use of a substantial amount of our cash for the repurchase of our shares,and this use of funds may limit our ability to complete other transactions or to pursue otherbusiness initiatives.     In April 2006, our board of directors authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to 15million common shares, of which 3.8 million shares remain under the current authorization. We expect torepurchase the remaining shares for cash as business conditions warrant. The full implementationof this repurchase program will use a significant portion of our capital reserves. This use ofcapital could limit future flexibility to complete acquisitions of businesses or technology, orother transactions, or make investments in research and development, new employee hiring, or otheraspects of operations that might be in our best interests, or could require that we borrow money orissue additional equity securities for such purposes. Any incurrence of debt may not be onfavorable terms and could result in our being subject to covenants or other contractualrestrictions that limit the ability to take advantage of other opportunities that may arise. Anysuch incurrence of debt would likely increase our interest expense, and any issuance of additionalequity securities would dilute the stock ownership of existing shareholders.(4) Operational Risks:We have significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating loansand leases.     Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with otherbanks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies,mortgage banking13 companies, insurance companies, and brokerage firms. Competition could intensify in the futureas a result of industry consolidation, the increasing availability of products and services fromnon-banks, greater technological developments in the industry, and banking reform.In the normal course of business, we process large volumes of transactions. However, there can beno assurance that we will be able to continue processing at the same or higher levels oftransactions. If systems of internal control should fail to work as expected, if systems are usedin an unauthorized manner, or if employees subvert the system of internal controls, significantlosses could result.     We process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types ofoperational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people,and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the company, the execution ofunauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, andbreaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss alsoincludes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency oras a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.     We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timelyand accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systemshave been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Proceduresexist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practicesare followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the effects ofoperational errors. Such losses are recorded as non-interest expense.     While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processingsystems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losseswill not occur.We mayfail to realize the anticipated cost savings and other financialbenefits of the merger on the anticipated schedule, if at all.     We may face significant challenges in integrating Sky Financials operations in our operations in atimely and efficient manner and in retaining Sky Financial personnel. Currently, each companyoperates as an independent public company. Achieving the anticipated cost savings and financialbenefits of the merger will depend on part on whether we integrate Sky Financials businesses in anefficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothlyor successfully. In addition, the integration of certain operations following the merger willrequire the dedication of significant management resources, which may temporarily distractmanagements attention from the day-to-day business of the combined company. Any inability torealize the full extent of, or any of, the anticipated cost savings and financial benefits of themerger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effecton the business and results of operations of the combined company, which may affect the marketprice of Huntington common stock.An extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact our business, results ofoperations, and financial condition.     Our operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, includingequipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire,power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking orviruses, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to suchactivity, or other events outside of our control could have a material adverseimpact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business,results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Ourbusiness recovery plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significantinterruptions of our operations.New or changes in existing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations couldsignificantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financialcondition.     The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state bankingregulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not tobenefit a financial companys shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significantlimitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us aredescribed in this report under the heading Regulatory Matters. These regulations, along with thecurrently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations,14 rules, standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financialinstitutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and governfinancial reporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, andinterpretations are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time.     In addition, we may be subject to actions of our regulators that are specific to us. Forfurther discussion, see Note 25 of the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of whichare filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference.     Events that may not have a direct impact on us, such as the bankruptcy of major U.S.companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators, and authoritative bodies, such as theFinancial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, andvarious taxing authorities responding by adopting and/or proposing substantive revisions to laws,regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations. International capital standardsdeveloped in the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may also affect thecompetitive environment for United States banks.     The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations, orchanges in or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or specific actions of regulators, may havea material impact on our business and results of operations; however, it is impossible to predictat this time the extent of any impact from these items.Non-compliance with USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could resultin fines or sanctions.     The USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs toprevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. Ifsuch activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activityreports with the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Theserules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying theidentity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with theseregulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last year, several banking institutionshave received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. We have developedpolicies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations.The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which would impact ourability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock.     The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and theirrespective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activitiesof the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has theauthority by statute to restrict the Banks ability to transfer assets, make shareholderdistributions, and redeem preferred securities.     Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out ofcurrent or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividendon shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount ofcapital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certainamounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of theOCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a nationalbank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with itsnet profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for theretirement of any preferred securities.     Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank becameunder-capitalized for purposes of the OCC prompt corrective action regulations.Under-capitalized is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio ofless than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to the parent company, it would impactour ability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2006, the Bank was incompliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered to be well-capitalized.     For further discussion, see the Parent Company Liquidity section included in our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders, portions of whichare filed as Exhibit 13.1 to this report, and incorporated byreference.15 The Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.     The Federal Reserve, which examines us and our non-bank subsidiaries, has a policy statingthat a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength toa subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source ofstrength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capitalinjections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engagingin unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Acapital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources toprovide it, and therefore may be required to borrow the funds. Any loans by a holding company toits subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain otherindebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, thebankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatoryagency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides thatclaims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims ofthe institutions general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capitalinjection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding companysresults of operations and cash flows.If any of our Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) affiliates fail to qualify as a REIT, we may besubject to a higher consolidated effective tax rate.     Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc. (HPCI), Huntington Preferred Capital II, Inc. (HPC-II) andHuntington Capital Financing, LLC (HCF) operate as REITs for federal income tax purposes. HPCI,HPC-II, and HCF are consolidated holding company subsidiaries established to acquire, hold, andmanage mortgage assets and other authorized investments to generate net income for distribution totheir shareholders.     Qualification as a REIT involves application of specific provisions of the Internal RevenueCode relating to various asset tests. A REIT must satisfy six asset tests quarterly: (1) 75% of thevalue of the REITs total assets must consist of real estate assets, cash and cash items, andgovernment securities; (2) not more than 25% of the value of the REITs total assets may consist ofsecurities, other than those includible under the 75% test; (3) not more than 5% of the value ofits total assets may consist of securities of any one issuer, other than those securitiesincludible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (4) not more than 10% ofthe outstanding voting power of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includibleunder the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (5) not more than 10% of the totalvalue of the outstanding securities of any one issuer may be held, other than those securitiesincludible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; and (6) a REIT cannot ownsecurities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries which comprise more than 20% of its totalassets. At December 31, 2006, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF met all of the quarterly asset tests.     Also, a REIT must annually satisfy two gross income tests: (1) 75% of its gross income must befrom qualifying income closely connected with real estate activities; and (2) 95% of its grossincome must be derived from sources qualifying for the 75% test plus dividends, interest, and gainsfrom the sale of securities. In addition, a REIT must distribute 90% of the REITs taxable incomefor the taxable year, excluding any net capital gains, to maintain its non-taxable status forfederal income tax purposes. For 2006, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF had met all annual income anddistribution tests.     If any of these REIT affiliates fail to meet any of the required provisions for REITs, theycould no longer qualify as a REIT and the resulting tax consequences would increase our effectivetax rate.We could be held responsible for environmental liabilities of properties acquired throughforeclosure of loans secured by real estate.     In the event we foreclose on a defaulted commercial mortgage and/or residential mortgage loanto recover our investment, we may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with theunderlying real property, which could exceed the value of the real property. Although we exercisedue diligence to discover potential environmental liabilities prior to acquiring any propertythrough foreclosure, hazardous substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants, or their sources maybe discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. There can be noassurance that we would not incur full recourse liability for the entire cost of any removal andclean-up on an acquired property, that the cost of removal and clean-up would not exceed the valueof the property, or that we could recover any of the costs from any third party.16 "

     Like other financial companies, we are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outsideof our direct control, though efforts are made to manage those risks while optimizing returns. Among therisks assumed are: (1) credit risk, which is the risk that loan and lease customers orother counterparties will be unable to perform their contractual obligations, (2) marketrisk, which is the risk that changes in market rates and prices will adversely affect ourfinancial condition or results of operation, (3) liquidity risk, which is the risk that theparent company and/or the Bank will have insufficient cash or access to cash to meet its operatingneeds, and (4) operational risk, which is the risk of loss resulting from inadequate orfailed internal processes, people and systems, or external events.     In addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report,readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, couldmaterially impact our business, future results of operations, and future cash flows.9 (1) Credit Risks:We extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally set standards and judgment. Wemanage the credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain creditdecisions, and an on-going process of assessment of the quality of the credit already extended.Our credit standards and on-going process of credit assessment mightnot protect us from significant credit losses.     We take credit risk by virtue of making loans and leases, purchasing non-governmentalsecurities, extending loan commitments and letters of credit, and being counterparties tooff-balance sheet financial instruments such as interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives.     Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standardsthat emphasize in-market lending while avoiding highly leveraged transactions as well asexcessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit administration function employs riskmanagement techniques to ensure that loans and leases adhere to corporate policy and problem loansand leases are promptly identified. These procedures provide us with the information necessary toimplement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions.     For further discussion about our management of credit risk, see the Credit Risk section ofManagements Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.Our loans, leases, and deposits are focused in five states and adverse economic conditions in thosestates, in particular, could negatively impact results from operations, cash flows, and financialcondition.     Concentration of credit risk can also arise with respect to loans and leases when theborrowers are located in the same geographical region. Our customers with loan and/or depositbalances at December 31, 2005, were located predominantly in Ohio, Michigan, West Virginia,Indiana, and Kentucky. Because of the concentration of loans, leases, and deposits in these states,in the event of adverse economic conditions in these states, we could experience more difficulty inattracting deposits and experience higher rates of loss and delinquency on our loans and leasesthan if the loans and leases were more geographically diversified. Adverse economic conditions andother factors, such as political or business developments or natural hazards that may affect thesestates, may reduce demand for credit or fee-based products and could negatively affect real estateand other collateral values, interest rate levels, and the availability of credit to refinanceloans at or prior to maturity.Declines in home values in our markets could adversely impact results from operations.     Like all banks, we are subject to the effects of any economic downturn, and in particular, asignificant decline in home values in our markets could have a negative effect on results ofoperations. At December 31, 2005, we had $4.6 billion of consumer home equity loans and lines witha weighted average loan-to-value ratio for the portfolio of 80%. In addition, at December 31,2005, we had $4.2 billion in residential real estate loans with a weighted average loan-to-valueratio of 71%. A significant decline in home values could lead to higher charge-offs in event ofdefault in both the consumer home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios.(2) Market Risks:Changes in interest rates could negatively impact our financial condition and results ofoperations.     Ourresults of operations depend substantially on net interest income,which is the difference betweeninterest earned on interest-earning assets (such as investments, loans, and direct financingleases) and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities (such as deposits and borrowings).Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including governmental monetary policies anddomestic and international economic and political conditions. Conditions such as inflation,recession, unemployment, money supply, and other factors beyond our control may also affectinterest rates. If our interest-earning assets mature or reprice more quickly thaninterest-bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment, net interest income could beadversely impacted. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly thaninterest-earnings assets in a rising interest rate environment, net interest income could beadversely impacted.10      Changes in interest rates also can affect the value of loans and other assets, includingretained interests in securitizations, mortgage and non-mortgage servicing rights, and our abilityto realize gains on the sale of assets. A portion of our earnings result from transactional income.An example of this type of transactional income is gain on sales of loans and other real estate owned. Thistype of income can vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year based on a number ofdifferent factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in interest rates thatadversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases maylead to an increase in non-performing assets and a reduction of income recognized, which could havea material, adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. For further discussion, seeNote 5 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in our2005 Annual Report.     Although fluctuations in market interest rates are neither completely predictable norcontrollable, our Market Risk Committee (MRC) meets periodically to monitor our interest ratesensitivity position and oversee our financial risk management by establishing policies andoperating limits. For further discussion, see the Interest Rate Risk section of ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of our 2005Annual Report.We could experience losses on residual values related to our automobile lease portfolio.     Inherently, automobile lease portfolios are subject to residual risk, which arises when themarket price of the leased vehicle at the end of the lease term is below the estimated residualvalue at the time the lease is originated. This situation arises due to a decline in used carmarket values. A reduction in the expected proceeds from the residualvalues of our direct financing leases would result in an immediaterecognition of impairment on the lease whereas a reduction in theexpected proceeds from the residual values of our operating leaseswould result in an increase in the depreciation of our operatinglease assets over the remaining term of the lease. For further discussion about our management of lease residual risk, see the LeaseResidual Risk section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.(3) Liquidity Risks:If we are unable to borrow funds through access to capital markets, we may not be able to meet thecash flow requirements of our depositors and borrowers, or meet the operating cash needs to fundcorporate expansion and other activities.     Liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost. Theliquidity of the Bank is used to make loans and leases and to repay deposit liabilities as theybecome due or are demanded by customers. Liquidity policies and limits are established by the boardof directors, with operating limits set by MRC, based upon the ratio of loans to deposits andpercentage of assets funded with non-core or wholesale funding. The Banks MRC regularly monitorsthe overall liquidity position of the Bank and the parent company to ensure that variousalternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity. MRC alsoestablishes policies and monitors guidelines to diversify the Banks wholesale funding sources toavoid concentrations in any one market source. Wholesale funding sources include Federal fundspurchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, non-core deposits, and medium- andlong-term debt, which includes a domestic bank note program and a Euronote program. The Bank isalso a member of certain Federal Home Loan Banks (FHLB), which provide funding through advances tomembers that are collateralized with mortgage-related assets.      We maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity.There are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed. These sources include the sale orsecuritization of loans, the ability to acquire additional national market, non-core deposits,the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings such as FHLB advances, the issuance of debt securities, andthe issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions. The Bank also canborrow through the Federal Reserves discount window.     If we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed, we might be unableto meet customers needs, which could adversely impact our financial condition, results ofoperations, cash flows, and level of regulatory-qualifying capital. For further discussion, see theLiquidity Risk section of Managements Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.11 If our credit ratings were downgraded, the ability to access funding sources may be negativelyimpacted or eliminated, and our liquidity and the market price of our common stock could beadversely impacted.     Credit ratings by the three major credit rating agencies are an important component of ourliquidity profile. Among other factors, the credit ratings are based on the financial strength,credit quality and concentrations in the loan portfolio, the level and volatility of earnings,capital adequacy, the quality of Management, the liquidity of the balance sheet, the availabilityof a significant base of core retail and commercial deposits, and the ability to access a broadarray of wholesale funding sources. Adverse changes in these factors could result in a negativechange in credit ratings and impact not only the ability to raise funds in the capital markets, butalso the cost of these funds. In addition, certain financial on- and off-balance sheet arrangementscontain credit rating triggers that could increase funding needs should a negative rating changeoccur. Letter of credit commitments for marketable securities, interest rate swap collateralagreements, and certain asset securitization transactions contain credit rating provisions.     Credit ratings as of December 31, 2005, for the parent company and the Bank can be found inTable 26 of Managements Discussion and Analysis of our 2005 Annual Report.     We rely on certain funding sources such as large corporate deposits, public fund deposits,federal funds, Euro deposits, FHLB advances, and bank notes. Although not contractually tied tocredit ratings, our ability to access these funding sources may be impacted by negative changes incredit ratings. In the case of public funds or FHLB advances, a credit downgrade may also trigger arequirement that we pledge additional collateral against outstandingborrowings. Credit rating downgrades could result in a loss of equityinvestor confidence.We have authorized the use of a substantial amount of our cash for the repurchase of our shares,and this use of funds may limit our ability to complete other transactions or to pursue otherbusiness initiatives.     In October 2005, our board of directors authorized a new program for the repurchase of up to15 million shares. We expect to repurchase shares for cash as business conditions warrant. Thefull implementation of this repurchase program will use a significant portion of our capitalreserves. This use of capital could limit future flexibility to complete acquisitions ofbusinesses or technology, or other transactions, or make investments in research and development, newemployee hiring, or other aspects of operations that might be in our best interests, or couldrequire that we borrow money or issue additional equity securities for such purposes. Anyincurrence of debt may not be on favorable terms and could result in our being subject to covenantsor other contractual restrictions that limit the ability to take advantage of other opportunitiesthat may arise. Any such incurrence of debt would likely increase our interest expense, and anyissuance of additional equity securities would dilute the stock ownership of existing shareholders.(4) Operational Risks:We have significant competition in both attracting and retaining deposits and in originating loansand leases.     Competition is intense in most of our markets. We compete on price and service with otherbanks and financial services companies such as savings and loans, credit unions, finance companies,mortgage banking companies, insurance companies and brokerage firms. Competition could intensify in the future as a result of industryconsolidation, the increasing availability of products and services from non-banks, greatertechnological developments in the industry, and banking reform.In thenormal course of business, we process largevolumes of transactions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continueprocessing at the same or higher levels of transactions. If systems of internal control should failto work as expected, if systems are used in an unauthorized manner, or if employees subvert thesystem of internal controls, significant losses could result.     We process large volumes of transactions on a daily basis and are exposed to numerous types ofoperational risk. Operational risk resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes, people,and systems includes the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the company, the execution ofunauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, andbreaches of the internal control system and compliance requirements. This risk of loss alsoincludes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of the operational deficiency oras a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards.12      We establish and maintain systems of internal operational controls that provide us with timelyand accurate information about our level of operational risk. While not foolproof, these systemshave been designed to manage operational risk at appropriate, cost-effective levels. Proceduresexist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and business practicesare followed. From time to time, losses from operational risk may occur, including the effects ofoperational errors. Such losses are recorded as non-interest expense.     While we continually monitor and improve the system of internal controls, data processingsystems, and corporate-wide processes and procedures, there can be no assurance that future losseswill not occur.Our acquisitions may not receive the necessary approvals, meet income and/or cost savingexpectation levels, or be integrated within time frames originally anticipated. We may encounterunforeseen difficulties, including unanticipated integration problems and business disruption inconnection with acquisitions. Acquisitions could also dilute stockholder value and adversely affectoperating results.     The completion of any merger is dependent on, among other things, receipt of shareholder andregulatory approvals, the timing of which cannot be predicted with precision or may not be receivedat all. Additionally, a merger may be more expensive to complete than anticipated, as a result ofunexpected factors or events, and the anticipated cost savings of a merger may take longer to berealized or may not be entirely achieved. The integration of acquired businesses and operations,including systems conversions, may take longer than anticipated, may be more costly thananticipated and may have unanticipated adverse results relating to our existing businesses or thebusinesses acquired. Further, decisions to sell or close units or otherwise change the business mixmay adversely impact combined results. Moreover, we may be unable to identify, negotiate, orfinance future acquisitions successfully. Future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutiveissuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, or amortizationexpenses.An extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact our business, results ofoperations, and financial condition.     Our operations depend upon, among other things, our infrastructure, including equipment andfacilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster,telecommunications failure, computer hacking or viruses, terrorist activity or the domestic andforeign response to such activity, or other events outside of our control could have a materialadverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on our business, results ofoperations, cash flows, and financial condition in particular. Ourbusiness recovery plan may not work as intended or may not preventsignificant interruptions of our operations.13 New or changes in existing tax, accounting, and regulatory rules and interpretations couldsignificantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations, cash flows, and financialcondition.     The financial services industry is extensively regulated. Federal and state bankingregulations are designed primarily to protect the deposit insurance funds and consumers, not tobenefit a financial companys shareholders. These regulations may sometimes impose significantlimitations on operations. The significant federal and state banking regulations that affect us aredescribed in this report under the heading Regulatory Matters. These regulations, along with thecurrently existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance, and monetary laws, regulations, rules,standards, policies, and interpretations control the methods by which financial institutionsconduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financialreporting and disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretationsare constantly evolving and may change significantly over time.     In addition, we may be subject to actions of our regulators that are specific to us. Forfurther discussion, see Note 23 of the Notes to ConsolidatedFinancial Statements included in our 2005 AnnualReport.     Events that may not have a direct impact on us, such as the bankruptcy of major U.S.companies, have resulted in legislators, regulators, and authoritative bodies, such as theFinancial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC, the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, andvarious taxing authorities responding by adopting and/or proposing substantive revisions to laws,regulations, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations. International capital standardsdeveloped in the framework of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may also affect thecompetitive environment for United States banks.     The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws and regulations, orchanges in or repeal of existing laws and regulations, or specific actions of regulators, may havea material impact on our business and results of operations; however, it is impossible to predictat this time the extent of any impact from these items.Non-compliancewith USA Patriot Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result infines or sanctions.     The USA Patriot and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs toprevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. Ifsuch activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activityreports with the U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. Theserules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying theidentity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with theseregulations could result in fines or sanctions. During the last year, several banking institutionshave received large fines for non-compliance with these laws and regulations. We have developedpolicies and procedures designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations.14 The OCC may impose dividend payment and other restrictions on the Bank, which would impact ourability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock.     The OCC is the primary regulatory agency that examines the Bank, its subsidiaries, and theirrespective activities. Under certain circumstances, including any determination that the activitiesof the Bank or its subsidiaries constitute an unsafe and unsound banking practice, the OCC has theauthority by statute to restrict the Banks ability to transfer assets, make shareholderdistributions, and redeem preferred securities.     Under applicable statutes and regulations, dividends by a national bank may be paid out ofcurrent or retained net profits, but a national bank is prohibited from declaring a cash dividendon shares of its common stock out of net profits until the surplus fund equals the amount ofcapital stock or, if the surplus fund does not equal the amount of capital stock, until certainamounts from net profits are transferred to the surplus fund. Moreover, the prior approval of theOCC is required for the payment of a dividend if the total of all dividends declared by a nationalbank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits for the year combined with itsnet profits for the two preceding years, less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for theretirement of any preferred securities.     Payment of dividends could also be subject to regulatory limitations if the Bank becameunder-capitalized for purposes of the OCC prompt corrective action regulations.Under-capitalized is currently defined as having a total risk-based capital ratio of less than8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, or a core capital, or leverage, ratio ofless than 4.0%. If the Bank were unable to pay dividends to theparent company, it would impact ourability to pay dividends to shareholders or repurchase stock. Throughout 2005, the Bank was incompliance with all regulatory capital requirements and considered tobe well-capitalized.     Forfurther discussion, see the Parent Company Liquidity section of Managements Discussion andAnalysis of our 2005 Annual Report.The Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support the Bank.     The Federal Reserve, which examines us and our non-bank subsidiaries, has a policy statingthat a bank holding company is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength toa subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the source ofstrength doctrine, the Federal Reserve may require a bank holding company to make capitalinjections into a troubled subsidiary bank, and may charge the bank holding company with engagingin unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank. Acapital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources toprovide it, and therefore may be required to borrow the funds. Any loans by a holding company toits subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain otherindebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, thebankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatoryagency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, the bankruptcy law provides thatclaims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims ofthe institutions general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations.Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the holding company in order to make the required capitalinjection becomes more difficult and expensive and will adversely impact the holding companysresults of operations and cash flows.If any of our Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) affiliates fail to qualify as a REIT, we may besubject to a higher consolidated effective tax rate.     Huntington Preferred Capital, Inc. (HPCI), Huntington Preferred Capital II, Inc. (HPC-II) andHuntington Capital Financing, LLC (HCF) operate as REITs for federal income tax purposes. HPCI,HPC-II, and HCF are consolidated holding company subsidiaries established to acquire, hold, andmanage mortgage assets and other authorized investments to generate net income for distribution totheir shareholders.15      Qualification as a REIT involves application of specific provisions of the Internal RevenueCode relating to various asset tests. A REIT must satisfy six asset tests quarterly: (1) 75% of thevalue of the REITs total assets must consist of real estate assets, cash and cash items, andgovernment securities; (2) not more than 25% of the value of the REITs total assets may consist ofsecurities, other than those includible under the 75% test; (3) not more than 5% of the value ofits total assets may consist of securities of any one issuer, other than those securitiesincludible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (4) not more than 10% ofthe outstanding voting power of any one issuer may be held, other than those securities includibleunder the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; (5) not more than 10% of the totalvalue of the outstanding securities of any one issuer may be held, other than those securitiesincludible under the 75% test or securities of taxable REIT subsidiaries; and (6) a REIT cannot ownsecurities in one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries which comprise more than 20% of its totalassets. At December 31, 2005, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF met all of the quarterly asset tests.     Also, a REIT must annually satisfy two gross income tests: (1) 75% of its gross income must befrom qualifying income closely connected with real estate activities; and (2) 95% of its grossincome must be derived from sources qualifying for the 75% test plusdividends, interest, and gainsfrom the sale of securities. In addition, a REIT must distribute 90% of the REITs taxable incomefor the taxable year, excluding any net capital gains, to maintain its non-taxable status forfederal income tax purposes. For 2005, HPCI, HPC-II, and HCF had met all annual income anddistribution tests.     Ifany of theseREIT affiliates fail to meet any of the required provisions forREITs, they couldno longer qualify as a REIT and the resulting tax consequences would increase our effective taxrate.We could be held responsible for environmental liabilities of properties acquired throughforeclosure of loans secured by real estate.     In the event we foreclose on a defaulted commercial mortgage and/or residential mortgage loanto recover our investment, we may be subject to environmental liabilities in connection with theunderlying real property, which could exceed the value of the real property. Although we exercisedue diligence to discover potential environmental liabilities prior to acquiring any propertythrough foreclosure, hazardous substances or wastes, contaminants, pollutants, or their sources maybe discovered on properties during our ownership or after a sale to a third party. There can be noassurance that we would not incur full recourse liability for the entire cost of any removal andclean-up on an acquired property, that the cost of removal and clean-up would not exceed the valueof the property, or that we could recover any of the costs from any third party.We have a pending formal supervisory agreement with the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland.     On March 1, 2005, we announced entering into a formal written agreement with the FederalReserve Bank of Cleveland (FRBC) providing for a comprehensive action plan designed to enhance ourcorporate governance, internal audit, risk management, accounting policies and procedures, andfinancial and regulatory reporting. The agreement called for independent third-party reviews, aswell as the submission of written plans and progress reports by Management and remains in effectuntil terminated by the banking regulators.     Wewere verbally advised that we were in full compliance with the financial holding company andfinancial subsidiary requirements under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act). This notificationreflects that we and the Bank meet both the well-capitalized and well-managed criteria underthe GLB Act. We believe that the changes we have already made, and are in the process of making,will address the FRBC issues fully and comprehensively.16 "
