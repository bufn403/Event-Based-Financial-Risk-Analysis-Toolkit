M&T and its subsidiaries face a number of potential risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company’s financial instruments and M&T’s securities, including its common stock. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company. 25 Market RiskWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have adverse effects on the Company’s business including:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company.•A decrease in net interest income derived from the Company’s lending and deposit gathering activities.•A decrease in the value of the Company’s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. •A decrease in fees from the Company’s brokerage, trust, and investment management businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices.•Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels or special FDIC assessments relating to the failure of specific banks.•An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill.•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses as well as impairment write-downs of certain investment securities and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.If recessionary economic conditions develop, they would likely have a negative financial impact across the financial services industry, including on the Company. If recessionary economic conditions are more severe, the extent of the negative impact on the Company’s business and financial performance can increase and be more severe, including the adverse effects listed above and discussed throughout this “Risk Factors
” section. Supply chain constraints, robust demand and labor shortages have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, including potentially higher interest rates, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may also enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for the Company’s products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers, result in lower values for the Company’s investment securities and other interest-earning assets and increase expense related to talent acquisition and retention. Additionally, economic conditions, financial markets and inflationary pressures may be adversely affected by the impact of current or anticipated geopolitical uncertainties; military conflicts, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the attacks on Israel and conflict in the Middle East; pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic; and global, national and local responses thereto by governmental authorities and other third parties. These unpredictable events could create, increase or prolong economic and financial disruptions and volatility that adversely affects the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. Concern regarding the ability of Congress to reach agreement on federal budgetary matters (including the debt ceiling), or total or partial governmental shutdowns, also can adversely affect the economy and increase the risk of economic instability or market volatility, which could have adverse consequences on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.26 The Company’s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.The Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates in 2022 and 2023 and may continue to raise or maintain interest rates in response to economic conditions, particularly inflationary pressures. As a result of the high percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, including in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, as well as changes linked to inflation, can have a material effect on the Company’s business and profitability and the value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. For example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may:•Affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company’s overall net interest income and profitability.•Adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable-rate loans and other debt instruments (including due to an inability to refinance loans), which, in turn, affects the Company’s loss rates on those assets.•Decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposits.•Affect the Company’s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges.•Affect mortgage prepayment speeds and result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations.The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Interest rate increases have reduced the value of the Company’s investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities. Furthermore, as interest rates rise, the Company’s unrealized gains on fixed income securities would ordinarily decrease and unrealized losses would ordinarily increase, which occurred in both 2022 and 2023 and could continue to occur in 2024. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve’s policies influence, to a significant extent, the Company’s cost of such funding, and increases in short-term interest rates have in the past increased, and may in the future increase, the Company’s cost of short-term funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax 27 authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.As most of the Company’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company’s performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility may:•Affect the value or liquidity of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.•Affect the value of capitalized servicing assets.•Affect M&T’s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and results of operations.•Affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company’s services.•Impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. In addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by supply chain disruptions, the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, as well as elevated inflation, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.The Company’s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company’s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, as well as events particularly affecting those regions. The credit quality of the Company’s borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside the Company’s control, including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuations. The trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, have caused, and in the future may cause, the Company to experience impairment charges, which are reductions in the recoverable value of an asset; increased purchase demands, wherein customers make withdrawals with minimum notice; higher costs (e.g. servicing, foreclosure, property maintenance); additional write-downs and losses and a potential impact to the ability to engage in lending transactions based on a reduction of customer deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.28 The discontinuation of benchmark rates as permissible rate indices in new contracts and the development of alternative benchmark indices to replace discontinued benchmarks could adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and a significant portion of the Company’s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate or to an alternative index. In the past, the regulators and administrators of certain benchmark rates have determined to cease publication of those rates, and they may do so again in the future with respect to other benchmark rates the Company utilizes. Any cessation of a benchmark rate and resulting transition to a successor benchmark would be complex and unpredictable, giving rise to a variety of risks, including operational risks, risks of value transfer between contract parties, the potential for customer disputes and litigation, as well as regulatory scrutiny.Risks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory EnvironmentThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors and the financial system as a whole, not securities holders, including the holders of common stock. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company’s sale and lending practices, capital structure, capital distributions and dividend policy, investment practices, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies, or to meet supervisory expectations, could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Following the failures of certain banks in 2023, banking regulators have proposed changes, or indicated the potential for changes, regarding the regulation and supervision of banking organizations, in particular those, such as M&T, with $100 billion or more in assets. The introduction of new or more stringent regulatory requirements, as well as heightened supervisory expectations, could require the Company to maintain additional capital or liquidity or incur significant expenses.Government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or admissions of wrongdoing as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact the Company’s supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the Company’s activities. A prior enforcement action also increases the risk that regulators and governmental authorities pursue formal enforcement actions in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation, even if unrelated to the prior enforcement action.Any new regulatory requirements, changes to existing requirements, or changes to interpretations of requirements could require changes to the Company’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the 29 behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory scrutiny, requirements or expectations could have significant effects on the Company, including through restrictions on growth or required remediation activities and associated resource requirements, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that have been enacted or proposed in recent years, and additional proposed changes are anticipated. Many of these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. For more information on the regulations to which the Company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see Part I, Item 1, ""Business.""The Company may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements and new requirements relating to long-term debt.BHCs, including M&T, are subject to capital and liquidity requirements and standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act (as amended by EGRRCPA) and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” under Part I, Item 1, ""Business.""Regulators have implemented and may, from time to time, implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions, could be limited. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets. In addition, the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the Company’s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective, which could adversely affect its net interest income and net interest margin. A determination by the Federal Reserve that M&T does not meet supervisory expectations regarding capital planning or liquidity risk management could have a variety of adverse consequences, including ratings downgrades, heightened supervisory scrutiny, expenses associated with remediation activities and potentially an enforcement action. See “Capital Requirements” and “Resolution Planning and Resolution-Related Requirements” under Part I, Item 1, ""Business"" for information regarding the federal banking regulators’ July 2023 proposal implementing the revisions to the Basel capital framework and August 2023 long-term debt proposal. The long-term debt proposal, if adopted, would require M&T to maintain more long-term debt than it does currently, which may adversely affect interest expense, net interest income and net interest margin.M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on the results of supervisory stress tests administered by the Federal Reserve.Any decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T’s Board of Directors and must comply with applicable capital regulations, including the maintenance of capital ratios exceeding specified minimum levels and applicable buffers.For BHCs designated as Category IV institutions under the Tailoring Rules, including M&T, the Federal Reserve conducts biennial supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby the BHC’s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. The results of those stress tests are incorporated in the determination of M&T’s SCB. As a general matter, 30 if M&T is unable to maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimum levels inclusive of its SCB, it would be subject to limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing stock. In June 2023, the Federal Reserve released the results of its most recent supervisory stress tests, and based on those results, on October 1, 2023, M&T’s SCB of 4.0% became effective. The results of future supervisory stress tests and the impact of proposed revisions to capital and long-term debt requirements upon the stress testing framework are uncertain, and a more severe outcome may result in a higher SCB and an increase in M&T’s effective capital requirements. An increased SCB may restrict M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T.The Federal Reserve has in the past implemented, and may in the future implement, restrictions on share repurchase programs and common stock dividends at large BHCs such as M&T, including in response to adverse or uncertain economic conditions. If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the OLF.The Dodd-Frank Act created a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important BHCs and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Credit RiskDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans and other obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans and obligations may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and entering into other financial arrangements.Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio, including in the office, retail, healthcare and multifamily sectors and in the New York City area; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. The Company’s credit risk and the performance of its lending portfolios may be affected by concentration in an industry, 31 geography or asset type. As described further in this “Risk Factors
” section, the Company’s credit risks may be increased by the impacts of inflation, poor or recessionary economic conditions and financial market volatility. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Emerging and evolving factors such as the shift to work-from-home or hybrid-work arrangements, changing consumer preferences (including for online shopping), and resulting changes in occupancy rates as a result of these and other trends can also impact such valuations over relatively short periods. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers, as described above.The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management’s judgment, the amount of losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2023 appropriately reflects expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover all credit losses that may occur.The Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to or derivative exposure of the Company. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.In addition, adverse developments at other financial institutions, including failures of other financial institutions, could result in negative media coverage regarding the financial services industry, which may negatively influence the perceptions of investors, borrowers or depositors regarding the financial services industry in general, a subset of financial institutions or M&T in particular.  Liquidity RiskThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. The Company relies on core customer deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include brokered deposits 32 and borrowings from securities dealers, various FHLBs and the FRB of New York, as well as the debt and equity capital markets.The Company’s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the Company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and funding. Such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the Company’s credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the Company’s ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T’s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.Regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and competitive position. Various regulations have been adopted to impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Company. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing and minimum liquidity requirements. The application of certain of these regulations to banking organizations, such as the Company, have been modified, including in connection with the implementation of the Tailoring Rules in the EGRRCPA. Following the failures of certain large banks in 2023, banking regulators indicated they may revise the liquidity requirements applicable to large financial institutions.If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company’s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The Company may also need to raise additional capital and liquidity through the issuance of stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends or share repurchases to preserve capital and liquidity.If the Company is unable to maintain or grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.The total amount that the Company pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on the Company’s ability to maintain or grow its deposits. If the Company is unable to sufficiently maintain or grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. Increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in and may continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing and with respect to non-deposit financial products. If competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company’s funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Customers may also move noninterest-bearing deposits to interest-bearing accounts, increasing the cost of those deposits. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. The Company’s bank customers could withdraw their money and put it in 33 alternative investments, causing the Company to lose a lower cost source of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce the Company’s net interest margin and net interest income.The Company could be subject to sudden withdrawals of deposits, including as a result of negative media coverage, which may be spread through social media, regarding the financial services industry generally, a subset of financial institutions or M&T specifically. Online and mobile banking have made it easier for customers to withdraw their deposits or transfer funds to other accounts with short notice. This may make retaining deposits during periods of stress more difficult. In addition, depositors of certain types of deposits, such as uninsured or uncollateralized deposits, may be more likely to withdraw their deposits and do so more quickly. Any such withdrawals could result in higher funding costs to the Company as it loses a lower cost source of funding, and significant unanticipated withdrawals could materially and adversely affect the Company’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T has typically received a substantial amount of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends have been M&T’s principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T’s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital and liquidity levels at BHCs and IDI subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent BHCs. See Part I, Item 1, ""Business,"" ""Supervision and Regulation of the Company"" and ""Distributions” for discussions of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on M&T’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock.Strategic RiskThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company’s revenue and profitability.The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with private credit funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms, financial technology companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments have and could continue to result in the Company’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company has and may continue 34 to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share. Technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology) are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the OCC’s financial technology company charter. In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation, including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain, as well as advances in robotic process automation, could significantly affect the competition for financial services. As a result, the Company has had and will likely continue to have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. Further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for acquisitions and in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company’s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.M&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. The Company’s ability to complete acquisitions is in many instances subject to regulatory approval, and the Company cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals would be granted. In recent years, federal authorities, including the bank regulators and Department of Justice, have increased their scrutiny of bank mergers and acquisitions, and there is continued uncertainty with regard to how they will evaluate bank mergers and acquisitions, including from an antitrust perspective. Any requisite approval could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to, among other factors, an adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approval, including factors not known at the time of entering into the definitive agreement for the acquisition or submission of the related application for regulatory approval, and factors that may arise subsequently; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment more generally. Anticipated challenges in obtaining any requisite regulatory approval, or uncertainty as to the prospects for obtaining approvals, could also prevent the Company from pursuing a potential acquisition it may otherwise view as attractive.In addition, inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity, such as with respect to the Company's People’s United acquisition in April 2022. Acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including:•Inability to fully achieve the Company’s strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition.•Issues arising during transition and integration.•Disruption of the Company’s business and diversion of management’s time and attention.•Exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions.•Loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions.•Dilution in the ownership percentage of holders of M&T common stock.35 •Payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company’s tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and long-term.•Inability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity (for example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity).•Changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities.•Reputational risks.The Company could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.The Company's success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the Company engages and markets that the Company serves is significant, and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company’s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. The Company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the Company does. Recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of changes in the marketplace, which may increase costs and adversely impact the Company. The increase in remote and hybrid-work arrangements and opportunities in regional, national and global labor markets has also increased competition for the Company to attract and retain skilled personnel. The Company’s current or future approach to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared with the arrangements offered by other companies, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees. If the Company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled, qualified and diverse individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.Operational RiskThe Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error or misconduct, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud by employees or persons outside the Company, and breaches in data security. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with 36 contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to the above referenced operational risks through outsourcing arrangements, as such outsourcing vendors are exposed to operational risks themselves, as well as the effects that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company’s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company’s reputation or foregone business opportunities.The Company’s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security, including due to events beyond the Company’s control.The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company’s customer relationships. Disruption of operating systems caused by events beyond the Company’s control may include computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, quality of vulnerability patches, cybersecurity attacks (including Distributed Denial of Service attacks, which occur when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor), damage to property or physical assets, or events arising from political protests or terrorist acts. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, disruption, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as digital and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cybersecurity attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been numerous instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors, or the freezing of operating systems and databases making them inaccessible or unusable. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to, or the usage of, operating systems and databases. Ransomware is a form of malicious software, known as “malware,” designed to block access to, and often encrypt, computer systems or data. Once the victim’s computer system or data is locked down and encrypted, rendering it essentially useless, the malicious cyber actor then extorts the victim by demanding a ransom payment in exchange for providing a method to decrypt it. The attacker may also copy the victim’s data in the course of the attack and threaten to sell or publish the data if the ransom is not paid. Ransomware attacks can result in a loss of business functionality and of sensitive data. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, the Company expects to continue to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cybersecurity criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees, customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.37 Further, third parties with which the Company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the Company’s customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the Company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Company’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the Internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Risks relating to cybersecurity attacks on vendors and other third parties, including supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers, have been rising as such attacks become increasingly frequent and severe. For example, in 2023, a widely reported global cybersecurity incident occurred involving MOVEit, a file transfer software product owned by Progress Software Corporation that is used by thousands of public and private sector entities worldwide. As reported, this incident resulted in the theft of sensitive data from a large number of organizations, and certain Company customer information in the possession of the Company’s external service providers was compromised in connection with it, while no information was obtained from the Company’s internal systems and these systems were not at risk from the MOVEit incident. Security breaches affecting the Company’s customers, or systems breakdowns, failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Company or its customers, thereby increasing the Company’s operational costs and adversely affecting its business. Additionally, successful cybersecurity attacks at other large financial institutions, whether or not the Company is impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect M&T, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company’s security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of the Company’s financial products. Though the Company has insurance against some cybersecurity risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.The Company, as well as third parties with which the Company does business, has expanded the use of cloud service providers, which could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cybersecurity attacks, negative changes to financial condition, bankruptcy, or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and reputation. For example, during 2021, there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud service providers. Thus, increasing the amount of infrastructure that the Company or its vendors and service providers outsource to the cloud or to other parties may increase M&T’s risk exposure. The failure to properly upgrade or maintain the computer systems could result in greater susceptibility to attacks, particularly in light of the greater frequency and severity of attacks in recent years, as well as the growing prevalence of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Failures related to upgrades and maintenance also increase risks related to unauthorized access and misuse, as well as the Company’s ability to achieve its business continuity and resiliency objectives.The Company could incur higher costs, experience lower revenue, and suffer reputational damage in the event of the theft, loss or misuse of information, including due to a cybersecurity attack. Like other financial services firms, the systems, networks and devices of the Company, its customers, employees, service providers or other third parties with whom the Company interacts continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering, and cybersecurity attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, eliminate access or cause other damage. These threats may arise from human error, fraud on the part of employees, insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technology failure or vulnerabilities of suppliers through supply chain attacks. Further, cybersecurity and information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased because of, among other things, the growth of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including computers, smartphones, and 38 other mobile devices outside the Company’s systems) by customers to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, fraudsters, hackers, terrorists, activists, instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties. Although the Company believes that a robust suite of authentication and layered security controls, data encryption and tokenization, threat intelligence, anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management tools exist, the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Moreover, potential new regulations may require the Company to disclose information about a cybersecurity event before it has been resolved or fully investigated. Further, as the Company expands its mobile and digital capabilities, cybersecurity risks increase.A disruption or breach, including as a result of a cybersecurity attack, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at the Company or at third-party service providers could result in significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, remediation costs, damage to reputation or loss of confidence in the security of systems, products and services that could adversely affect the Company’s business. Like other U.S. financial services providers, the Company continues to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cybersecurity threats from sophisticated third parties. Although the Company is not aware of any material losses relating to cybersecurity incidents, there can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cybersecurity incidents will not become known or occur or that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of customers, clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage.The Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of customers, clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage. New privacy and data protection initiatives will impose additional operational burdens on the Company, may limit the Company’s ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data. Significant examples include the General Data Protection Act, the UK General Data Protection Act, known as The Data Protection Act of 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Compliance with these and other laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the Company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions for breach of such laws and regulations.As privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, they may also limit how companies like M&T can use personal data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data. The time and resources needed for the Company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. The impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions.M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company’s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all 39 types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to the Company’s third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the Company. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors’ use of common service providers.The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.Many aspects of the Company’s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries’ business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk with respect to its obligations to indemnify directors and officers of it and its subsidiaries in connection with certain legal matters as well as in situations where it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Business RiskChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations.The accounting standard setters, including the FASB, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company’s prior period financial statements. Information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 27 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, ""Financial Statements and Supplemental Data"" of this Form 10-K.40 The Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management’s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to GAAP, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company’s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see ""Critical Accounting Estimates"" in Part II, Item 7, ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and note 1 of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.The Company’s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.The Company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values, among other uses. The Company uses models throughout many of its business lines, relying on them, along with its judgement, for many decision making processes. Examples of areas where the Company uses models include determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and evaluating liquidity risks. The Company also uses models to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Models generally evaluate the performance of various factors under anticipated future conditions, relying on historical data to help build the model and in part on assumptions as to the future, often with respect to macro-economic conditions, in order to generate the output. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models, including in the choice of relevant historical data or future-looking assumptions, present the risk that the Company’s business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information, which may damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations. Even if the underlying assumptions used in the Company’s models are adequate, the models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design. As a result, the Company’s models may not fully capture or express the risks the Company faces, may suggest that the Company has sufficient reserves, capital or liquidity 41 when it may not, or may lead the Company to misjudge the business and economic environment in which it operates. If the models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, the Company may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Furthermore, strategies that the Company employs to manage and govern the risks associated with its use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, the Company may realize losses or other lapses. Finally, information the Company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that the Company’s regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to M&T’s stockholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.The Company is exposed to reputational risk.A negative public opinion of the Company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the Company’s lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to the Company’s reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, developments and the actions of other participants in the financial services industry, including failures of other financial institutions or activities of the Company’s contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. A service disruption of the Company’s technology platforms, or to those of the Company's service providers or vendors, or an impact to the Company’s branches could have a negative impact on a customer’s access to banking services and harm the Company’s reputation with customers. In particular, a cybersecurity event impacting the Company’s or its customers’ data could have a negative impact on the Company’s reputation and customer confidence in the Company and its cybersecurity. Damage to the Company’s reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets.Additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company’s framework for managing risks may not be effective.The Company’s risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage its risk exposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework’s underlying assumptions, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, and operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. There are inherent limitations to the Company’s risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Company relies on both qualitative and quantitative factors, including models, to monitor, measure and analyze certain risks and to estimate certain financial values, which are subject to error. The Company must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among its employees, as well as manage risks associated with third parties, and could fail to do so effectively. If the Company’s risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences, and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations.42 Pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company’s business. Pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; acts of war; military conflicts, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East as a result of recent attacks on Israel; or terrorism and other adverse external events, including severe weather and other natural disasters, could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.For example, the COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. Depending on the impact of pandemics, military conflicts, terrorism and other detrimental or destabilizing global and national events on general economic and market conditions, consumer and corporate spending and investment and borrowing patterns, there is a risk that adverse conditions could occur, including supply chain disruptions; higher inflation; decreased demand for the Company’s products and services or those of its borrowers, which could increase credit risk; challenges related to maintaining sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages, talent attrition, employee illness and willingness to return to work; and disruptions to business operations at the Company and at counterparties, vendors and other service providers. Even after such events fully subside, the U.S. economy may experience a prolonged economic slowdown or recession, and M&T anticipates the Company’s businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic slowdown or recession.The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine or other hostilities, such as the conflict in the Middle East resulting from recent attacks on Israel, could result in, among other things, further increased risk of cybersecurity attacks, supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets.To the extent that pandemics, acts of war or conflict, terrorism and other detrimental external events adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital or results of operations, such factors may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section.The Company’s assets, communities, operations, reputation and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts of climate risk.The Company operates in regions where its businesses and the activities of its customers could be negatively impacted by climate risk. This includes the physical risks resulting from chronic shifts in climate, such as rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels, and acute climate events, such as an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados. Such chronic shifts and acute events could damage or otherwise impact the value or productivity of customers’ assets and disrupt the Company’s operations and the operations of customers or third parties on which the Company relies. They could also result in market volatility, negatively impact the Company’s customers’ ability to repay outstanding loans, and damage or deteriorate the value of collateral. Over time such risks may result in both increasing premiums for and reduced availability of insurance and have a broader impact on the economy.Further, climate risk may manifest from efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. Transition risks may arise from changes in consumer and business preferences, legislation, regulation, policy, and 43 technological advancement associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change. Such risks may result in increased expenses or otherwise adversely impact the Company and its customers, including the ability of customers to repay outstanding loans. The Company could experience increased expenses resulting from climate-related strategic planning and market changes, as well as litigation and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to the Company’s actual or perceived action, or inaction, regarding climate change. For example, the Company’s reputation may be damaged, its financial condition could suffer, and its ability to attract and retain employees may be harmed as a result of any perceived ineffective identification, monitoring or management of risks relating to providing financial services to certain industries or projects that are sensitive to a transition to a lower carbon economy, as well as any decisions the Company makes to continue to conduct or change its activities in response to considerations relating to climate change.In addition, laws, regulations, and the expectations of federal and state banking regulators, investors and other stakeholders regarding appropriate climate risk management, practices and disclosures are continuously evolving and may require financial institutions including the Company, to adhere to new or heightened requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending, investment, operations and advisory activities. For example, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC jointly issued interagency guidance for large financial institutions on principles for climate-related financial risk management in October 2023, the NYSDFS issued proposed guidance for New York State-regulated banking and mortgage institutions relating to the management of material financial risks from climate change in December 2022, and the SEC proposed climate-related disclosure rules in March 2022. In addition, a number of states in which the Company operates have enacted or proposed statutes and regulations addressing climate change and sustainability issues. Any such new or heightened requirements may result in higher regulatory, compliance, and other expenses, and may subject the Company to different and potentially conflicting requirements in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Discussions of the specific risks outlined herein and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1, “Business,” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” is a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts’ estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies"

M&T and its subsidiaries face a number of potential risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company’s financial instruments and M&T’s securities, including its common stock. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company.  25 Risks Related to the Acquisition of People’s UnitedM&T may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition of People’s United and integrating People’s United may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected.In connection with the acquisition of People’s United that was completed on April 1, 2022, M&T has incurred and may further incur costs as M&T continues to integrate the People’s United business. The success of the acquisition depends, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of M&T and People’s United. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the acquisition, M&T must integrate and combine People’s United’s businesses in a manner that permits cost savings to be realized, without adversely affecting revenues and future growth. If M&T is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the acquisition could be less than anticipated.There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the acquisition will be realized to offset the transaction and integration costs over time. M&T may also incur additional costs to retain legacy People’s United customers, maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. M&T has waived certain fees following conversion of customer deposit accounts to M&T’s deposit servicing system, and similar or other costs related to integration of People's United or operations as a combined company may be incurred in the future. It is possible that challenges related to operating as a combined company could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect M&T’s abilities to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of M&T, which may adversely affect the value of M&T’s common stock. M&T may be unable to retain personnel successfully.The success of the acquisition will depend in part on the Company’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees. It is possible that these employees, including key legacy People’s United employees, may decide not to remain with the Company. If the Company is unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful future operations of the combined company, the Company could face disruptions in its operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. If key employees terminate their employment, the Company’s business activities may be adversely affected and the Company may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements.Litigation related to the acquisition has been filed in the past and additional litigation may be filed in the future, which could result in the payment of damages or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of the Company.Although not currently active, litigation related to the acquisition was filed against People’s United, the People’s United board of directors and M&T prior to the completion of the acquisition. Additional litigation may be filed against M&T and the M&T board of directors in the future. Among other remedies, litigation that was filed sought damages, and additional litigation by shareholders of M&T in the future may seek damages or other remedies. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain. Such lawsuits and the defense or settlement of any such lawsuits may have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of M&T. 26 Market RiskWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have adverse effects on the Company’s business including:•A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company.•A decrease in net interest income derived from the Company’s lending and deposit gathering activities.•A decrease in the value of the Company’s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. •A decrease in fees from the Company’s brokerage, trust, and investment management businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices.•Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels.•An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill.•An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses as well as impairment write-downs of certain investment securities and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.If recessionary economic conditions develop, they would likely have a negative financial impact across the financial services industry, including on the Company. If recessionary economic conditions are more severe, the extent of the negative impact on the Company’s business and financial performance can increase and be more severe, including the adverse effects listed above and discussed throughout this “Risk Factors
” section. Supply chain constraints, robust demand and labor shortages have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy. Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may also enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for the Company’s products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers, result in lower values for the Company’s investment securities and other interest-earning assets and increase expense related to talent acquisition and retention. Additionally, economic conditions, financial markets and inflationary pressures may be adversely affected by the impact of current or anticipated geopolitical uncertainties, military conflicts, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, and global, national and local responses thereto by governmental authorities and other third parties. These unpredictable events could create, increase or prolong economic and financial disruptions and volatility that adversely affects the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. The Company’s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.27 The Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates throughout 2022 and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions, particularly inflationary pressures. As a result of the high percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, including in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, as well as changes linked to inflation, can have a material effect on the Company’s business and profitability and the value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. For example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may:•Affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company’s overall net interest income and profitability.•Adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable-rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the Company’s loss rates on those assets.•Decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposits.•Affect the Company’s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges.•Affect mortgage prepayment speeds and result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations. The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Interest rate increases have recently reduced the value of the Company’s investment portfolio, for example, by decreasing the estimated fair value of fixed income securities. Furthermore, as interest rates rise, the Company’s unrealized gains on fixed income securities would ordinarily decrease and unrealized losses would ordinarily increase, which occurred in 2022 and could continue to occur in 2023. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve’s policies influence, to a significant extent, the Company’s cost of such funding, and increases in short-term interest rates have in the past increased, and may in the future increase, the Company’s cost of short-term funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.28 The discontinuation of LIBOR as a permissible rate index in new contracts, the formal announcement of LIBOR’s cessation date, and the development of SOFR and other alternative benchmark indices to replace LIBOR could adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company’s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and a significant portion of the Company’s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or to an alternative index. With respect to LIBOR, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, and the ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”), the administrator of LIBOR, have announced that the publication of all tenors of USD LIBOR, which to date have been calculated and determined by the IBA based on the required submissions by independent panel banks, will cease to exist and/or cease to be “representative” after June 30, 2023. In response and in coordination, U.S. federal bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve, required U.S. banks to cease using USD LIBOR as a reference rate in new contracts by December 31, 2021. Concurrently, the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“ARRC”) finalized and issued recommendations for the use of so-called “hardwired” LIBOR fallback language that, when incorporated into existing LIBOR-based loan documents, provides for, upon LIBOR’s permanent cessation (or an announcement from LIBOR’s administrator or certain governmental authorities that LIBOR is no longer representative of the underlying market), the replacement of LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the benchmark index, with an appropriate spread adjustment that is representative of the historical difference between LIBOR and SOFR, which when added to SOFR would be intended to facilitate a value-neutral transition. Subsequently, the ARRC expanded its recommendation to include CME Term SOFR, a derivative of SOFR that is currently administered and published by the CME Group Benchmark Administration Limited. In 2021 M&T adopted hardwired fallback language modeled after the ARRC recommendations for use in all new commercial LIBOR loans, and continues to proactively seek amendments to its existing LIBOR-based commercial loan contracts to incorporate such hardwired fallback language or move to an alternative index prior to the cessation of LIBOR.SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based repurchase transactions. The fact that SOFR is a secured overnight rate and considered a “risk free” rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured term rate that factors in credit risk, means that SOFR may perform differently than LIBOR, and those differences may be material, particularly in times of economic stress, negatively impacting the Company’s profitability. While the ARRC has maintained its recommendation that SOFR is the preferred replacement for LIBOR, some industry participants have questioned whether a “risk free” SOFR-based rate is an ideal replacement for LIBOR in the commercial lending market and suggesting that a credit-sensitive component or alternative be considered and developed. One such credit sensitive alternative is the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), which gained some modest attention and use in the commercial lending market in the latter half of 2021 (primarily in syndicated loans), but has since gained little traction. Whether BSBY or other alternatives to SOFR develop and gain any significant market traction in the future are unknown and unpredictable at this time, and this adds further market uncertainty with respect to introducing alternative benchmark rates for new contracts. LIBOR cessation is also impacting the derivatives market. In October 2020, The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA), published the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (Supplement) and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (Protocol). The Supplement, which became effective on January 25, 2021, amends existing standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate robust fallbacks to the SOFR benchmark for derivatives linked to LIBOR. The Protocol enables market 29 participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the Protocol. The fallbacks apply following a permanent cessation of LIBOR or following a determination by the FCA that LIBOR is no longer representative of the underlying market. M&T and M&T Bank adhered to the Protocol on November 5, 2020, and the Company is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap hedging transactions with certain of its end user customers, (i.e., borrowers that have hedged their interest rate payment obligations) who have not already adhered to, or amended their legacy derivatives transactions consistent with, the Protocol. If the Company is not able to agree to appropriate LIBOR fallbacks with these customers, there will be uncertainty as to how to value and determine the Company’s rights and obligations under legacy derivatives contracts. With respect to the Company’s cleared interest rate derivatives that reference LIBOR, both the CME and LCH clearinghouses have adopted the same relevant SOFR benchmark fallbacks of the Supplement and Protocol which also became effective on January 25, 2021.The Company has outstanding issuances, or acts as an administrative (or calculation) agent or in other capacities, across various maturities of securities referencing LIBOR in which the underlying contracts do not contemplate cessation or contemplate cessation but do so in a manner that may create other risks (“Tough Legacy Contracts”). Some of these contracts provide for selecting replacement rates in a manner that presents significant challenges or that gives the Company or another party discretion to select a rate or provide for determination of a reference rate. In March 2022, the United States Congress enacted the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act (""LIBOR Act"") which provides both a statutory framework to replace USD LIBOR with a benchmark rate based on SOFR for Tough Legacy Contracts governed by U.S. law and a safe harbor provision for those entities selecting a SOFR-based rate identified by the Federal Reserve. Under the LIBOR Act, the Federal Reserve must adopt rules to, among other things, identify the applicable SOFR-based replacement rate. In December 2022, the Federal Reserve adopted rules, which identify different SOFR-based replacement rates for derivative contracts, for cash instruments such as floating-rate notes and preferred stock, for consumer loans, for certain government-sponsored enterprise contracts and for certain asset-backed securities. Notwithstanding this availability of statutory frameworks to address Tough Legacy Contracts, there will likely be continued uncertainty surrounding the transition as these frameworks have not been tested, and the finalized regulations from the Federal reserve have not been issued and their effectiveness and ultimate impact is not certain. A substantial portion of the Company’s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2023) are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and non-hedging purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. Uncertainty as to the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR and the replacement of LIBOR with a SOFR-based index or any alternative index could result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts under certain circumstances, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.The market’s transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will be complex and unpredictable, giving rise to a variety of risks, including operational risks, risks of value transfer between contract parties, the potential for customer disputes and litigation, as well as regulatory scrutiny.The Company’s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.As most of the Company’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company’s performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of 30 the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility may:•Affect the value or liquidity of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.•Affect the value of capitalized servicing assets.•Affect M&T’s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and results of operations.•Affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company’s services.•Impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. In addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by supply chain disruptions, the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, as well as elevated inflation, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.The Company’s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company’s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The credit quality of the Company’s borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside the Company’s control, including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuations. The trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, have caused, and in the future may cause, the Company to experience impairment charges, which are reductions in the recoverable value of an asset, increased purchase demands, wherein customers make withdrawals with minimum notice, higher costs (e.g. servicing, foreclosure, property maintenance), additional write-downs and losses and a potential impact to engage in lending transactions based on a reduction of customer deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory EnvironmentThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors and the financial system as a whole, not securities holders, including the holders of common stock. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company’s sale and lending practices, capital structure, capital distributions and dividend policy, investment practices, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies, or to meet supervisory expectations, could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking 31 charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or admissions of wrongdoing as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact the Company’s supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the Company’s activities. A prior enforcement action also increases the risk that regulators and governmental authorities pursue formal enforcement actions in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation, even if unrelated to the prior enforcement action.Any new regulatory requirements, changes to existing requirements, or changes to interpretations of requirements could require changes to the Company’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory scrutiny, requirements or expectations could have significant effects on the Company, including through restrictions on growth or required remediation activities and associated resource requirements, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that have been enacted or proposed in recent years, and additional proposed changes are anticipated. Many of these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. For more information on the regulations to which the Company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see Part I, Item 1 — Business.The Company may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.Bank holding companies, including M&T, are subject to capital and liquidity requirements and standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act (as amended by EGRRCPA) and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” under Part I, Item 1 — Business.Regulators have implemented and may, from time to time, implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions, could be limited. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets. In addition, the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the Company’s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective, which could adversely affect its net interest income and net interest margin. The federal bank regulators have not yet released a proposal to implement the significant revisions of the Basel capital framework announced by the Basel Committee in December 2017, and the impact 32 on the Company of these revisions will depend on the manner in which they are implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as M&T.M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on the results of supervisory stress tests administered by the Federal Reserve.Any decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T’s Board of Directors and must comply with applicable capital regulations, including the maintenance of capital ratios exceeding specified minimum levels and applicable buffers.For bank holding companies designated as Category IV institutions under the Tailoring Rules, including M&T, the Federal Reserve conducts biennial supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby the BHC’s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. The results of those stress tests are incorporated in the determination of M&T’s Stress Capital Buffer. As a general matter, if M&T is unable to maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimum levels inclusive of its Stress Capital Buffer, it would be subject to limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing stock. In June 2022, the Federal Reserve released the results of its most recent supervisory stress tests, and based on those results, on October 1, 2022, M&T’s stress capital buffer of 4.7% became effective. The results of future supervisory stress tests are uncertain, and a more severe outcome may result in a higher Stress Capital Buffer and an increase in M&T’s effective capital requirements. An increased Stress Capital Buffer may restrict M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T.The Federal Reserve has in the past implemented, and may in the future implement, restrictions on share repurchase programs and common stock dividends at large bank holding companies such as M&T, including in response to adverse or uncertain economic conditions. If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (“OLF”).The Dodd-Frank Act created a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Credit RiskDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans and other obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans and obligations may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and entering into other financial arrangements.33 Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio, including in the New York City area; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. The Company’s credit risk and the performance of its lending portfolios may be affected by concentration in an industry, geography or asset type. As described further in this “Risk Factors
” section, the Company’s credit risks may be increased by the impacts of inflation, poor or recessionary economic conditions and financial market volatility. The COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, customers.Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Emerging and evolving factors such as the shift to work-from-home or hybrid-work arrangements, changing consumer preferences (including for online shopping), COVID-19-related restrictions and resulting changes in occupancy rates as a result of these and other trends can also impact such valuations over relatively short periods. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers, as described above.The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management’s judgment, the amount of losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2022 appropriately reflects expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover all credit losses that may occur.The Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to or derivative exposure of the Company. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. 34 Liquidity RiskThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as the debt and equity capital markets.The Company’s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the Company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and funding. Such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the Company’s credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the Company’s ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T’s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.Regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and competitive position. Various regulations have been adopted to impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Company. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing and minimum liquidity requirements. The application of certain of these regulations to banking organizations, such as the Company, have been modified, including in connection with the implementation of the tailoring rules in the EGRRCPA.If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company’s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The Company may also need to raise additional capital and liquidity through the issuance of stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends or share repurchases to preserve capital and liquidity.If the Company is unable to maintain or grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.The total amount that the Company pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on the Company’s ability to maintain or grow its deposits. If the Company is unable to sufficiently maintain or grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. Recent increases in 35 short-term interest rates have resulted in and may continue to result in more intense competition in deposit pricing. If competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company’s funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Customers may also move noninterest-bearing deposits to interest bearing accounts, increasing the cost of those deposits. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. The Company’s bank customers could withdraw their money and put it in alternative investments, causing the Company to lose a lower cost source of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce the Company’s net interest margin and net interest income.M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are M&T’s principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T’s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See “Item 1 — Business, Supervision and Regulation of the Company, Distributions” for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on M&T’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock.Strategic RiskThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company’s revenue and profitability.The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with private credit funds, insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms, financial technology companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments have and could continue to result in the Company’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company has and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share. 36 Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology) are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the OCC’s fintech charter. In addition, the emergence, adoption and evolution of new technologies that do not require intermediation, including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain, as well as advances in robotic process automation, could significantly affect the competition for financial services. As a result, the Company has had and will likely continue to have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. Further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for acquisitions and in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company’s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.M&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. The Company’s ability to complete acquisitions is in many instances subject to regulatory approval, and the Company cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals would be granted. Any requisite approval could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to, among other factors, an adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approval, including factors not known at the time of entering into the definitive agreement for the acquisition or submission of the related application for regulatory approval, and factors that may arise subsequently; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment more generally.In addition, inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including:•Inability to fully achieve the Company’s strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition.•Issues arising during transition and integration.•Disruption of the Company’s business and diversion of management’s time and attention.•Exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions.•Loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions.•Dilution in the ownership percentage of holders of M&T common stock.•Payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company’s tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and long-term.•Inability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity (for example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity).•Changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities.37 M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.M&T’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the Company engages and markets that the Company serves is significant, and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company’s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. The Company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the Company does. Recruiting and compensation costs may increase as a result of changes in the marketplace, which may increase costs and adversely impact the Company. The increase in remote and hybrid work arrangements and opportunities in regional, national and global labor markets has also increased competition for the Company to attract and retain skilled personnel. The Company’s current or future approach to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared with the arrangements offered by other companies, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability to attract and retain employees. If the Company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled, qualified and diverse individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.Operational RiskThe Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error or misconduct, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud by employees or persons outside the company, and breaches in data security. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company’s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company’s reputation or foregone business opportunities. 38 The Company’s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security, including due to events beyond the Company’s control.The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company’s customer relationships. Disruption of operating systems caused by events beyond the Company’s control may include computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, quality of vulnerability patches, cyber security attacks (including Distributed Denial of Service attacks, which occur when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor), damage to property or physical assets, or events arising from political protests or terrorist acts. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, disruption, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as digital and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber security attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been numerous instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors, or the freezing of operating systems and databases making them inaccessible or unusable. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to, or the usage of, operating systems and databases. Ransomware is a form of malicious software, known as “malware,” designed to block access to, and often encrypt, computer systems or data. Once the victim’s computer system or data is locked down and encrypted, rendering it essentially useless, the malicious cyber actor then extorts the victim by demanding a ransom payment in exchange for providing a method to decrypt it. The attacker may also copy the victim’s data in the course of the attack and threaten to sell or publish the data if the ransom is not paid. Ransomware attacks can result in a loss of business functionality and of sensitive data. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, the Company expects to continue to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber security criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees, customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.Further, third parties with which the Company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the Company’s customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the Company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Company’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the Internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Risks relating to cyber attacks on vendors and other third parties, including supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers, have been rising as such attacks become increasingly frequent and severe. Security breaches affecting the Company’s customers, or systems breakdowns, failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such 39 other third parties, may require the Company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Company or its customers, thereby increasing the Company’s operational costs and adversely affecting its business. Additionally, successful cyber security attacks at other large financial institutions, whether or not the Company is impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect M&T, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company’s security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of the Company’s financial products. Though the Company has insurance against some cyber security risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.The Company, as well as third parties with which the Company does business, has expanded the use of cloud service providers, which could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber security-attacks, negative changes to financial condition, bankruptcy, or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and reputation. For example, during 2021, there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud service providers. Thus, increasing the amount of infrastructure that the Company or its vendors and service providers outsource to the cloud or to other parties may increase M&T’s risk exposure. The failure to properly upgrade or maintain the computer systems could result in greater susceptibility to attacks, particularly in light of the greater frequency and severity of attacks in recent years, as well as the growing prevalence of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Failures related to upgrades and maintenance also increase risks related to unauthorized access and misuse, as well as the Company’s ability to achieve its business continuity and resiliency objectives.The Company could incur higher costs, experience lower revenue, and suffer reputational damage in the event of the theft, loss or misuse of information, including due to a cyber security attack. Like other financial services firms, the systems, networks and devices of the Company, its customers, employees, service providers or other third parties with whom the Company interacts continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering, and cyber security attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, eliminate access or cause other damage. These threats may arise from human error, fraud on the part of employees, insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technology failure or vulnerabilities of suppliers through supply chain attacks. Further, cyber security and information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased because of, among other things, the growth of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies (including computers, smartphones, and other mobile devices outside the Company’s systems) by customers to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, fraudsters, hackers, terrorists, activists, instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties. Although the Company believes that a robust suite of authentication and layered security controls, data encryption and tokenization, threat intelligence, anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management tools exist, the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Moreover, potential new regulations may require the Company to disclose information about a cybersecurity event before it has been resolved or fully investigated. Further, as the Company expands its mobile and digital capabilities, cyber security risks increase.A disruption or breach, including as a result of a cyber security attack, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at the Company or at third-party service providers could result in significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, remediation costs, damage to reputation or loss of confidence in the security of systems, products and services that could adversely 40 affect the Company’s business. Like other U.S. financial services providers, the Company continues to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cyber security threats from sophisticated third parties. Although the Company is not aware of any material losses relating to cyber security incidents, there can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cyber security incidents will not become known or occur or that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of customers, clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damageThe Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of customers, clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage. New privacy and data protection initiatives will impose additional operational burdens on the Company, may limit the Company’s ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data. Significant examples include the General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), the UK GDPR, known as The Data Protection Act of 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Compliance with these and other laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the Company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions for breach of such laws and regulations.As privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, they may also limit how companies like M&T can use personal data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data. The time and resources needed for the Company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. The impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions.M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company’s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to the Company’s third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the Company. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors’ use of common service providers.The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.Many aspects of the Company’s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various 41 lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries’ business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk with respect to its obligations to indemnify directors and officers of it and its subsidiaries in connection with certain legal matters as well as in situations where it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Business RiskChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations.The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company’s prior period financial statements. Information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 27 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K.The Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management’s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company’s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.42 Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.The Company’s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.The Company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values, among other uses. The Company uses models throughout many of its business lines, relying on them, along with its judgement, for many decision making processes. Examples of areas where the Company uses models include determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels. The Company also uses models to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Models generally evaluate the performance of various factors under anticipated future conditions, relying on historical data to help build the model and in part on assumptions as to the future, often with respect to macro-economic conditions, in order to generate the output. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models, including in the choice of relevant historical data or future-looking assumptions, present the risk that the Company’s business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information, which may damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations. Even if the underlying assumptions used in the Company’s models are adequate, the models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design. As a result, the Company’s models may not fully capture or express the risks the Company faces, may suggest that the Company has sufficient capital when it may not, or may lead the Company to misjudge the business and economic environment in which it operates. If the models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, the Company may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Furthermore, strategies that the Company employs to manage and govern the risks associated with its use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, the Company may realize losses or other lapses. Finally, information the Company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that the Company’s regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to M&T’s stockholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient. 43 The Company is exposed to reputational risk.A negative public opinion of the Company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the Company’s lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to the Company’s reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the Company’s contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. A service disruption of the Company’s technology platforms or an impact to the Company’s branches could have a negative impact on a customer’s access to banking services and harm the Company’s reputation with customers. In particular, a cyber security event impacting the Company’s or its customers’ data could have a negative impact on the Company’s reputation and customer confidence in the Company and its cyber security. Damage to the Company’s reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets.Additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company’s framework for managing risks may not be effective.The Company’s risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage its risk exposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework’s underlying assumptions, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputational risk, and operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. There are inherent limitations to the Company’s risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Company relies on both qualitative and quantitative factors, including models, to monitor, measure and analyze certain risks and to estimate certain financial values, which are subject to error. The Company must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among its employees, as well as manage risks associated with third parties, and could fail to do so effectively. If the Company’s risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences, and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations.Pandemics, including COVID-19, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company’s business. Pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of war, military conflicts, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or terrorism and other adverse external events, including severe weather and other natural disasters, could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.44 For example, the COVID-19 pandemic created economic and financial disruptions that adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect, the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will in the future negatively affect the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations will depend on highly uncertain and unpredictable developments, including the scope and duration of any surges in the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines and other public health measures, the continued effectiveness of M&T’s business continuity plans, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on the Company’s employees, customers, clients, counterparties, vendors, service providers and other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic.Depending on the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, military conflicts such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, terrorism and other detrimental or destabilizing global and national events on general economic and market conditions, consumer and corporate spending and investment and borrowing patterns, there is a risk that adverse conditions could occur, including supply chain disruptions; higher inflation; decreased demand for the Company’s products and services or those of its borrowers, which could increase credit risk; challenges related to maintaining sufficient qualified personnel due to labor shortages, talent attrition, employee illness, willingness to return to work; and disruptions to business operations at the Company and at counterparties, vendors and other service providers. Even after such events fully subside, the U.S. economy may experience a prolonged economic slowdown or recession, and M&T anticipates the Company’s businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic slowdown or recession.The escalation or continuation of the war between Russia and Ukraine or other hostilities could result in, among other things, further increased risk of cyber attacks, supply chain disruptions, higher inflation, lower consumer demand and increased volatility in commodity, currency and other financial markets.To the extent that pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, acts of war, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, or terrorism and other detrimental external events adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital or results of operations, such factors may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section.The Company’s assets, communities, operations, reputation and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts of climate risk.The Company operates in regions where its businesses and the activities of its customers could be negatively impacted by climate risk. This includes the physical risks resulting from chronic shifts in climate, such as rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and acute climate events, such as an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados. Such chronic shifts and events could damage or otherwise impact the value or productivity of customers’ assets and disrupt the Company’s operations and the operations of customers or third parties on which the Company relies. They could also result in market volatility, negatively impact the Company’s customers’ ability to repay outstanding loans, and damage or deteriorate the value of collateral. Over time such risks may result in both increasing premiums for and reduced availability of insurance and have a broader impact on the economy.Further, climate risk may manifest from efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. Transition risks may arise from changes in consumer and business preferences, legislation, regulation, policy, and technological advancement associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change. Such risks may result in increased expenses or otherwise adversely impact the Company and its customers, including the ability of customers to repay outstanding loans. The Company could experience increased expenses resulting from climate-related strategic planning and market changes, as well as litigation and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced investor 45 and stakeholder confidence due to its climate change strategy and responses. For example, the Company’s reputation may be damaged and its financial condition could suffer as a result of the ineffective identification, monitoring or management of risks relating to providing financial services to certain industries or projects that are sensitive to a transition to a lower carbon economy, as well as any decisions the Company makes to continue to conduct or change its activities in response to considerations relating to climate change.Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding appropriate climate risk management, practices and disclosures, such as the climate-related disclosure rules proposed by the SEC in 2022, may also result in higher regulatory, compliance and other expenses. In addition, the expectations of federal and state banking regulators, investors and other stakeholders are continuously evolving and may require financial institutions including the Company, to adhere to increased requirements and expectations regarding the disclosure and management of their climate risks and related lending, investment, operations and advisory activities.Discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts’ estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies"

M&T and its subsidiaries face a number of potential risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company’s financial instruments and M&T’s securities, including its common stock. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company. These risk factors include risks relating to M&T’s acquisition of People’s United pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger, dated February 21, 2021, by and among M&T, Bridge Merger Corp., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of M&T, and People’s United (the “merger agreement” and, such transaction, the “merger”). Risks Related to the Merger with People’s UnitedM&T is expected to incur significant costs related to the merger and integration.M&T has incurred and expects to incur significant, non-recurring costs in connection with negotiating the merger agreement and closing the merger. In addition, M&T will incur integration costs following the completion of the merger as M&T integrates the People’s United business, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and employment-related costs.There can be no assurances that the expected benefits and efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses will be realized to offset these transaction and integration costs over time. M&T may also incur additional costs to maintain employee morale and to retain key employees. M&T will also incur significant legal, financial advisory, accounting, banking and consulting fees, fees relating to regulatory filings and notices, SEC filing fees, printing and mailing fees and other costs associated with the merger. Some of these costs are payable regardless of whether the merger is completed.Combining M&T and People’s United may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and M&T may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger.The success of the merger will depend, in part, on the ability to realize the anticipated cost savings from combining the businesses of M&T and People’s United. To realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from the merger M&T and People’s United must integrate and combine their businesses in a manner that permits cost savings to be realized, without adversely affecting revenues and future growth. If M&T and People’s United are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings of the merger could be less than anticipated, and integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses.An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, levels of expenses and operating results of M&T following the completion of the merger, which may adversely affect the value of M&T’s common stock following the completion of the merger.M&T and People’s United have operated and, until the completion of the merger, must continue to operate, independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies’ abilities to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the merger. Integration efforts between the two companies may also divert 29management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on M&T during this transition period and for an undetermined period after completion of the merger.M&T may be unable to retain M&T and/or People’s United personnel successfully.The success of the merger will depend in part on M&T’s ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by M&T and People’s United. It is possible that these employees may decide not to remain with M&T or People’s United, as applicable, while the merger is pending or with M&T after the merger is completed. If M&T and People’s United are unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations of the companies, M&T and People’s United could face disruptions in their operations, loss of existing customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, following the merger, if key employees terminate their employment, M&T’s business activities may be adversely affected, and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating M&T and People’s United to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause M&T’s business to suffer. In addition, M&T and People’s United may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company.The COVID-19 pandemic may delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.The COVID-19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations of M&T and People’s United. If the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause a continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of M&T or People’s United, or the business operations of M&T or People’s United are further disrupted as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, efforts to complete the merger and integrate the businesses of M&T and People’s United may also be delayed and adversely affected. Additional time may be required to obtain the requisite regulatory approval, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”) may impose additional requirements on M&T or People’s United that must be satisfied prior to completion of the merger, which could delay and adversely affect the completion of the merger.Regulatory approval from the Federal Reserve Board may not be received, may take longer than expected, or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on M&T following the merger.Before the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement may be completed, certain regulatory approvals must be obtained. Approvals from the New York State Department of Financial Services and the State of Connecticut Department of Banking, among other regulatory approvals, have been received but the transaction remains subject to approval from the Federal Reserve Board. That approval could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to: an adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approval, including factors not known at the present time and factors that may arise in the future; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment generally. The Federal Reserve Board has stated that if material weaknesses are identified by examiners before a banking organization applies to engage in expansionary activity, the Federal Reserve Board will expect the banking organization to resolve all such weaknesses before applying for such expansionary activity. The Federal Reserve Board has also stated that if issues arise during the processing of an application for expansionary activity, it will expect the applicant banking organization to withdraw its application pending resolution of any supervisory concerns.30Any Federal Reserve Board approval, if granted, may impose terms and conditions, limitations, obligations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of M&T’s business or require changes to the terms of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. There can be no assurance that the regulator will not impose any such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, limitations, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting the revenues of M&T following the merger or otherwise reduce the anticipated benefits of the merger if the merger were consummated successfully within the expected timeframe. In addition, there can be no assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the merger. Additionally, the completion of the merger is conditioned on the absence of certain orders, injunctions or decrees by any court or regulatory agency of competent jurisdiction that would prohibit or make illegal the completion of any of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement.In addition, despite the parties’ commitments to use their reasonable best efforts to comply with conditions imposed by regulators, under the terms of the merger agreement, M&T will not be required, and People’s United will not be permitted without M&T’s prior written consent, to take actions or agree to conditions in connection with obtaining the foregoing permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of governmental entities that would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on M&T and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, after giving effect to the merger.Failure to complete the merger could negatively impact M&T.If the merger is not completed for any reason, there may be various adverse consequences and M&T may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. For example, M&T’s business may have been impacted adversely by the failure to pursue other beneficial opportunities due to the focus of management on the merger, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of completing the merger. Additionally, if the merger agreement is terminated, the market price of M&T common stock could decline to the extent that the current market price of M&T common stock reflects a market assumption that the merger will be beneficial to M&T and will be completed. M&T could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the merger or to proceedings commenced against M&T to perform its obligations under the merger agreement. If the merger agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, M&T may be required to pay a termination fee of $280 million to People’s United.Additionally, M&T has incurred and will incur substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, as well as the costs and expenses of preparing, filing, printing and mailing the joint proxy statement/prospectus for the merger, and all filing and other fees paid in connection with the merger. If the merger is not completed, M&T would have incurred these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the merger.M&T is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger is pending.Uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on M&T. These uncertainties may impair M&T’s ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed, and could cause customers and others that deal with M&T to seek to change existing business relationships with M&T. In addition, subject to certain exceptions, M&T has agreed to refrain from taking certain actions that may adversely affect its ability to consummate the merger on a timely basis without People’s United’s consent. These restrictions may prevent M&T from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger.31Litigation related to the merger has been filed against People’s United, the People’s United board of directors and M&T, and additional litigation may be filed against People’s United, the People’s United board of directors, M&T and the M&T board of directors in the future, which could prevent or delay the completion of the merger, result in the payment of damages or otherwise negatively impact the business and operations of M&T.Litigation related to the merger has been filed against People’s United, the People’s United board of directors and M&T, and additional litigation may be filed against People’s United, the People’s United board of directors, M&T and the M&T board of directors in the future. Among other remedies, litigation that has been filed seeks, and additional litigation by shareholders of M&T and/or stockholders of People’s United in the future may seek damages and/or to enjoin the merger or the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement. The outcome of any litigation is uncertain. If any plaintiff were successful in obtaining an injunction prohibiting M&T or People’s United from completing the merger or any other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement, then such injunction may delay or prevent the effectiveness of the merger and could result in significant costs to M&T, including costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with the merger. Further, such lawsuits and the defense or settlement of any such lawsuits may have an adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of M&T.Risks Relating to COVID-19 Pandemic M&T’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic has caused severe disruption to the U.S. and global economy and created significant volatility in the financial markets.  The duration of this disruption and impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.The pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants, the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines and other public health measures, the continued effectiveness of M&T’s business continuity plans, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on the Company’s employees, customers, clients, counterparties, vendors, service providers and other market participants, and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.Although economic and market conditions have generally improved during 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic, including associated variants, has, at times, resulted in adverse economic and market conditions.  Depending on the duration and severity of the pandemic on general economic and market conditions, consumer and corporate spending and investment and borrowing patterns, there is a risk that adverse conditions could occur, including the following: •Increased unemployment levels, interrupted income of consumers and decreased consumer confidence generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures; •Increased disruption to businesses, permanent or temporary closure of businesses and decreased business confidence generally, leading to increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and bankruptcies;32 •An initial sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity, fixed-income and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets; •A decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, which could negatively impact the Company’s net interest income and margin; •Higher inflation and supply chain disruptions; •Declines in collateral values; •Increased demands on capital and liquidity; •Heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks to the Company, including as a result of remote work arrangements for employees and increased digital and mobile banking activities by customers; •Disruptions to the business operations of the Company, including temporary branch closures and disruptions to branch and office openings, supply chains and employee travel and working arrangements; and •Disruptions to business operations at counterparties, vendors and other service providers. The pandemic is likely to continue to contribute to these risks and impacts and could affect geographic areas in which the Company operates differently as further noted herein under “Market Risk” and “Credit Risk.” As a result, the Company’s credit, liquidity, market, operational and other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides. In addition, the Company’s business operations continue to be at risk of adverse disruption if significant portions of the Company’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology that disrupt remote work arrangements or other effects of the pandemic, or if the Company is unable to keep branches or offices open, including because of risk of infection. The Company faces similar risks if its counterparties, vendors and other service providers are unable to maintain operations due to pandemic-related disruptions.  The pandemic may also delay or adversely affect M&T’s efforts to complete the merger and integrate the businesses of the Company and People’s United, if the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic cause a continued or extended decline in the economic environment and the financial results of M&T or People’s United or cause further disruption to the business operations of the Company or People’s United.Governmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of those measures is not yet entirely known and those measures, or additional measures that may be introduced, may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. If such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s borrowers, the Company may also experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periods. The Company also faces an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions. Furthermore, various government programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program are complex and the Company’s participation may lead to litigation and governmental, regulatory and third party scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to its reputation. 33The length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the measures being put in place to address it are unknown. It is unknown when there will be a return to normal business activity and a subsiding of the economic stress associated with the pandemic. Prolonged continuation of the pandemic could worsen these risks and impacts. Until the pandemic subsides, the Company may experience reduced revenues in certain of its fee-related businesses and increased customer and client defaults, including defaults in unsecured loans. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a prolonged economic slowdown or recession, and M&T anticipates the Company’s businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic slowdown or recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section and M&T’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the Company’s business and operations following the completion of the merger with People’s United.Market RiskWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have adverse effects on the Company’s business including: •A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company. •A decrease in net interest income derived from the Company’s lending and deposit gathering activities. •A decrease in the value of the Company’s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate.  •A decrease in fees from the Company’s brokerage, trust, and investment management businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. •Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels. •An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. •An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses as well as impairment write-downs of certain investment securities and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale. Volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation, which may lead to increased costs for businesses and consumers and potentially contribute to poor business and economic conditions generally, may also enhance or contribute to some of the risks discussed herein. For example, higher inflation, or volatility and uncertainty related to inflation, could reduce demand for the Company’s products, adversely affect the creditworthiness of the Company’s borrowers or result in lower values for the Company’s investment securities and other interest-earning assets.The Company’s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.34As a result of the high percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, including in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, as well as changes linked to inflation, can have a material effect on the Company’s business and profitability and the value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. For example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may: •Affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company’s overall net interest income and profitability. •Adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the Company’s loss rates on those assets. •Decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposits. •Affect the Company’s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. •Affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations.The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve’s policies influence, to a significant extent, the Company’s cost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.The discontinuation of LIBOR as a permissible rate index in new contracts after 2021, the formal announcement of LIBOR’s cessation date (June 30, 2023), and ongoing uncertainty related to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace LIBOR, could adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and a significant portion of the  Company’s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or to an alternative index, currency, basket or other financial metric. 35In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intended to stop persuading or compelling its panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement created market uncertainty as to whether and to what extent panel banks would continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and as to the continued existence of LIBOR after 2021. The uncertainty lessened in November 2020, when (i) public statements issued by the ICE Benchmark Administration (“IBA”), the administrator of LIBOR, and the FCA, announced a proposal to, among other things, extend the publication of the most commonly utilized tenors of USD LIBOR until June 30, 2023, and (ii) a joint-statement of the federal bank regulators, including the Federal Reserve, indicated support for the IBA proposal and encouraged banks to (a) transition away from USD LIBOR as soon as practicable, (b) cease (with limited exceptions) entering into new contracts that use USD LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and no later than December 31, 2021, and (c) for new contracts entered into before December 31, 2021, either utilize a reference rate other than USD LIBOR or include robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after USD LIBOR’s discontinuation, noting that failure to do so would create safety and soundness risks. On March 5, 2021, public statements by the FCA and IBA confirmed the future cessation (or non-representativeness) of all USD LIBOR tenors, and specifically, the June 30, 2023 cessation date for the most commonly utilized USD LIBOR tenors, after which USD LIBOR will either no longer exist or no longer be representative of the underlying market it is intended to measure.    Following the initial FCA announcement in 2017, regulators and various financial industry groups sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“AARC”)) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace LIBOR, and publish recommended practices for transitioning the market away from LIBOR, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). In 2020, the ARRC finalized and issued recommendations for the use of so-called “hardwired” LIBOR fallback language that, when incorporated into existing LIBOR-based loan documents, provides for, upon LIBOR’s permanent cessation (or an announcement from LIBOR’s administrator or certain governmental authorities that LIBOR is no longer representative of the underlying market), the replacement of LIBOR with SOFR as the benchmark index, with an appropriate spread adjustment that is representative of the historical difference between LIBOR and SOFR, which when added to SOFR would be intended to facilitate a value-neutral transition. In April 2021, M&T adopted hardwired fallback language modeled after the ARRC recommendations for use in all new LIBOR loans.  SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based repurchase transactions.  The fact that SOFR is a secured overnight rate and considered a “risk free” rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured term rate that factors in credit risk, means that SOFR may perform differently than LIBOR, and those differences may be material, particularly in times of economic stress, negatively impacting the Company’s profitability.  Over the past few years, the AARC’s recommendations and proposals have evolved, and the Company has continued to monitor both ARRC and general market developments.  While the ARRC has maintained its recommendation that SOFR is the preferred replacement for LIBOR, some industry participants are questioning whether a “risk free” SOFR rate is an ideal replacement for LIBOR in the commercial lending market and suggesting that a credit-sensitive component or alternative be considered and developed. One such credit sensitive alternative is the Bloomberg Short-Term Bank Yield Index (BSBY), which gained some increased attention and use in the business loan market in the latter half of 2021. Whether BSBY or other alternatives develop and gain any significant traction in the market are unknown and unpredictable at this time, and this adds 36further uncertainty to the LIBOR transition process, both with respect to amending existing LIBOR contracts and pricing new contracts based on SOFR or an alternative reference rate going forward. LIBOR cessation is also impacting the derivatives market.  In October 2020, The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA), published the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (Supplement) and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (Protocol).  The Supplement, which became effective on January 25, 2021, amends existing standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate robust fallbacks to the SOFR benchmark for derivatives linked to LIBOR. The Protocol enables market participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the Protocol. The fallbacks apply following a permanent cessation of LIBOR or following a determination by the FCA that LIBOR is no longer representative of the underlying market. M&T and M&T Bank adhered to the Protocol on November 5, 2020, and the Company is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap hedging transactions with its end user customers, i.e., borrowers who have hedged their interest rate payment obligations. If the Company is not able to agree to appropriate LIBOR fallbacks with these customers, there will be uncertainty as to how to value and effect the Company’s rights and obligations under legacy derivatives contracts.  With respect to the Company’s cleared interest rate derivatives that reference LIBOR, both the CME and LCH clearinghouses have adopted the same relevant SOFR benchmark fallbacks of the Supplement and Protocol which also became effective on January 25, 2021.         The Company has outstanding issuances, or acts as an administrative (or calculation) agent or in other capacities, across various maturities of securities referencing LIBOR in which the underlying contracts do not contemplate cessation or contemplate cessation but do so in a manner that may create other risks (“Tough Legacy Contracts”).  Some of these contracts provide for selecting replacement rates in a manner that presents significant challenges or that gives the Company or another party discretion to select a rate or provide for determination of a reference rate.  In April 2021, the New York State legislature passed Senate Bill 297B/Assembly Bill 164B which allows certain New York State law governed Tough Legacy Contracts to transition to SOFR, as the statutory benchmark replacement rate, by operation of law. Similarly, the United States Congress is currently considering the Adjustable Interest Rate (LIBOR) Act of 2021 (H.R. 4616) which, if enacted, would have an analogous effect on the transition of Tough Legacy Contracts, but would expand the applicability beyond the State of New York to contracts governed by the laws of any state, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States. Notwithstanding the availability or potential availability of statutory frameworks to address Tough Legacy Contracts, there will likely be continued uncertainty surrounding the transition as these frameworks have not been tested and their effectiveness and ultimate impact is not certain. The discontinuation of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to the Company’s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company has issued or owns. A substantial portion of the Company’s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2023) are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. Uncertainty as to the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR, the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative index, and the operational feasibility of amending existing contracts referencing LIBOR to include hardwired LIBOR fallback language referencing a new replacement index could result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.The market’s transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will be complex and unpredictable, giving rise to a variety of risks, including operational risks, risks of value transfer 37between contract parties, the potential for customer disputes and litigation, as well as regulatory scrutiny, as the most recent regulatory announcements indicate that there will be increased regulatory focus on LIBOR transition in 2022 and beyond. The Company established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program in 2019, which now includes a LIBOR Transition Office with senior management level leadership and dedicated full-time employee staffing.  An impact assessment has been completed to identify on- and off-balance sheet exposures, systems, processes, models, customers, and employees affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Company continues to develop and execute plans to transition products and contracts associated with LIBOR to alternative reference rates.  The Company’s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.As most of the Company’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company’s performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility may: •Affect the value or liquidity of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. •Affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. •Affect M&T’s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and results of operations. •Affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company’s services. •Impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. In addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, as well as elevated inflation, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.The Company’s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company’s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The credit quality of the Company’s borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside the Company’s control, including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuations. The trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, have caused, and in the future may cause, the Company to experience impairment charges, which are drastic reductions 38in the recoverable value of an asset, increased purchase demands, wherein customers make withdrawals with minimum notice, higher costs (e.g., servicing, foreclosure, property maintenance), additional write-downs and losses and a potential impact to engage in lending transactions based on a reduction of customer deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Risks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory EnvironmentThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors and the financial system as a whole, not securities holders, including the holders of common stock. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company’s sale and lending practices, capital structure, capital distributions and dividend policy, investment practices, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies, or to meet supervisory expectations, could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or admissions of wrongdoing as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact the Company’s supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the Company’s activities.  A prior enforcement action also increases the risk that regulators and governmental authorities pursue formal enforcement actions in connection with the resolution of an inquiry or investigation, even if unrelated to the prior enforcement action.Any new regulatory requirements, changes to existing requirements, or changes to interpretations of requirements could require changes to the Company’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory scrutiny, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that have been enacted or proposed in recent years, and additional proposed changes are anticipated. Many of these and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. For more information on the regulations to which the Company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see Part I, Item 1 — Business in this report.39M&T may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.Bank holding companies, including M&T, are subject to capital and liquidity requirements and standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act (as amended by EGRRCPA) and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” under Part I, Item 1 —  Business.Regulators have and may, from time to time, implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity requirements and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions, could be limited. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets. In addition, the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the Company’s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective, which could adversely affect its net interest income and net interest margin. The federal bank regulators have not yet released a proposal to implement the significant revisions of the Basel capital framework announced by the Basel Committee in December 2017, and the impact on the Company of these revisions will depend on the manner in which they are implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as M&T.M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on the results of supervisory stress tests administered by the Federal Reserve.Any decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T’s Board of Directors and must comply with applicable capital regulations, including the maintenance of capital ratios exceeding specified minimum levels and applicable buffers.For bank holding companies designated as Category IV institutions under the Tailoring Rules, including M&T, the Federal Reserve conducts biennial supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby the BHC’s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. The results of those stress tests are incorporated in the determination of M&T’s Stress Capital Buffer.  As a general matter, if M&T is unable to maintain capital in excess of regulatory minimum levels inclusive of its Stress Capital Buffer, it would be subject to limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing stock. In August 2021, the Federal Reserve Board provided M&T with a Stress Capital Buffer of 2.5%, representing the floor under the regulatory capital rules, which became applicable to M&T on October 1, 2021.  The results of future supervisory stress tests are uncertain, and a more severe outcome may result in a higher Stress Capital Buffer and an increase in M&T’s effective capital requirements.  An increased Stress Capital Buffer may restrict M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T.In addition, during 2020 and the first half of 2021, the Federal Reserve implemented measures requiring all large bank holding companies to preserve capital through limitations on share repurchase programs and common stock dividends. While these restrictions are no longer applicable, the Federal Reserve may implement similar restrictions in the future, including in response to adverse or uncertain economic conditions. Also, if, as in June 2020, the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan, the Company generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.40If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (“OLF”).The Dodd-Frank Act created a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Credit RiskDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans and other obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans and obligations may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and entering into other financial arrangements.Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio, including in the New York City area; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. The Company’s credit risk and the performance of its lending portfolios may be affected by concentration in an industry, geography or asset type. Also, as described further in the risk factor above, the Company’s credit risks have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides. The pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, customers, including businesses in the hotel and travel industry.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support its customers, the Company offered (primarily in 2020, but also in 2021) payment deferrals and other expanded assistance to businesses and consumers, and committed in certain states in which it operates to suspend residential mortgage payments and foreclosure sales for financially impacted customers for certain periods of time. A significant number of the Company’s customers sought to suspend their mortgage payments under these programs. Suspensions of mortgage payments and foreclosures and reduced pricing under these programs may adversely affect the Company’s revenue and results of operations. In addition, if these programs are not effective in mitigating the financial consequences of COVID-19 on customers, or if customers are unable to pay their loans after these programs expire, the Company may experience 41higher rates of default, increased credit losses and additional increases to the allowance for credit losses in future periods.Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property.  Emerging and evolving factors such as the shift to work-from-home arrangements, changing consumer preferences (including for online shopping), COVID-19-related restrictions and resulting changes in occupancy rates as a result of these and other trends can also impact such valuations over relatively short periods.  Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers, including as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above.The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management’s judgment, the amount of losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 appropriately reflects expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover all credit losses that may occur.The Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to or derivative exposure of the Company. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Liquidity RiskThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory requirements and supervisory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as well as the debt and equity capital markets.The Company’s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, 42which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the Company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and funding. Such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the Company’s credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the Company’s ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T’s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.Regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and competitive position. Various regulations have been adopted to impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Company. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing and minimum liquidity requirements. The application of certain of these regulations to banking organizations, such as the Company, have been modified, including in connection with the implementation of the tailoring rules in the EGRRCPA.  While marginal relief from certain capital and liquidity standards has been afforded to the Company (such as relief from LCR compliance), overall capital and liquidity management practices and expectations will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company’s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The Company may also need to raise additional capital and liquidity through the issuance of stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends or share repurchases to preserve capital and liquidity.If the Company is unable to maintain or grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.The total amount that the Company pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on the Company’s ability to maintain or grow its deposits. If the Company is unable to sufficiently maintain or grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company’s funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more expensive sources of funding. Customers may also move noninterest-bearing deposits to interest bearing accounts, increasing the cost of those deposits. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. The Company’s bank customers could withdraw their money and put it in alternative investments, causing the Company to lose a lower cost source of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce the Company’s net interest margin and net interest income.43M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are M&T’s principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T’s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See “Item 1 —  Business, Supervision and Regulation of the Company, Distributions” for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on M&T’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock.Strategic Risk The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company’s revenue and profitability.The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms, financial technology companies and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments have and could continue to result in the Company’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company has and may continue to experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the OCC’s fintech charter. As a result, the Company has had and will likely continue to have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. Further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new 44technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Difficulties in obtaining regulatory approval for acquisitions and in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company’s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.  M&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future.  The Company’s ability to complete acquisitions is in many instances subject to regulatory approval, and the Company cannot be certain when or if, or on what terms and conditions, any required regulatory approvals would be granted. Any requisite approval could be delayed or not obtained at all, including due to, among other factors, an adverse development in either party’s regulatory standing or in any other factors considered by regulators when granting such approval, including factors not known at the time of entering into the definitive agreement for the acquisition or submission of the related application for regulatory approval, and factors that may arise subsequently; governmental, political or community group inquiries, investigations or opposition; or changes in legislation or the political environment more generally.In addition, inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including: •Inability to fully achieve the Company’s strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. •Issues arising during transition and integration. •Disruption of the Company’s business and diversion of management’s time and attention. •Exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions. •Loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions. •Dilution in the ownership percentage of holders of M&T common stock. •Payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company’s tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and long-term. •Inability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity (for example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity). •Changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities.M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.M&T’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the Company engages and markets that the Company serves is significant, and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company’s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. The Company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the Company does. The increase in remote work arrangements and opportunities in regional, national and global labor markets has also increased competition for the Company to attract and retain skilled personnel. The Company’s current or future approach to in-office and remote-work arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable as compared to the arrangements offered by other companies, which could adversely affect the Company’s ability 45to attract and retain employees. If the Company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.Operational RiskThe Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error or misconduct, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud by employees or persons outside the company, and breaches in data security. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company’s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company’s reputation or foregone business opportunities.  As described further in the risk factor herein, the Company’s operational risks have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.The Company’s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security, including due to events beyond the Company’s control.The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company’s customer relationships. Disruption of operating systems caused by events beyond the Company’s control  may include computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, quality of vulnerability patches, cyber security attacks (including Distributed Denial of Service attacks, which occur when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor), damage to property or physical assets, or events arising from political protests or terrorist acts. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect 46of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, disruption, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as digital and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber security attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been numerous instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors, or the freezing of operating systems and databases making them inaccessible or unusable. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to, or the usage of, operating systems and databases. Ransomware is a form of malicious software, known as “malware,” designed to block access to, and often encrypt, computer systems or data. Once the victim’s computer system or data is locked down and encrypted, rendering it essentially useless, the malicious cyber actor then extorts the victim by demanding a ransom payment in exchange for providing a method to decrypt it. The attacker may also copy the victim’s data in the course of the attack and threaten to sell or publish the data if the ransom is not paid. Ransomware attacks can result in a loss of business functionality and of sensitive data. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, the Company expects to continue to expend significant additional resources to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber security criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees, customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.Further, third parties with which the Company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the Company’s customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the Company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Company’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the Internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Company’s customers, or systems breakdowns, failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Company or its customers, thereby increasing the Company’s operational costs and adversely affecting its business. Additionally, successful cyber security attacks at other large financial institutions, whether or not the Company is impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect M&T, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company’s security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of the Company’s financial products. Though the Company has insurance against some cyber security risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.The Company, as well as third parties with which the Company does business, has expanded the use of cloud service providers, which providers could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber security-attacks, negative changes to financial condition, bankruptcy, or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and reputation. Thus, increasing the amount of infrastructure that the Company or its vendors and service providers outsource to the cloud or to other parties may increase M&T’s risk exposure. The failure to properly upgrade or maintain the computer systems could result in greater susceptibility to attacks, 47particularly in light of the greater frequency and severity of attacks in recent years, as well as the growing prevalence of supply chain attacks affecting software and information technology service providers. Failures related to upgrades and maintenance also increase risks related to unauthorized access and misuse, as well as the Company’s ability to achieve its business continuity and resiliency objectives.The Company could incur higher costs, experience lower revenue, and suffer reputational damage in the event of the theft, loss or misuse of information, including due to a cyber security attack. Like other financial services firms, the systems, networks and devices of the Company, its customers, employees, service providers or other third parties with whom the Company interacts continue to be the subject of attempted unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering, and cyber security attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, eliminate access or cause other damage. These threats may arise from human error, fraud on the part of employees, insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technology failure or vulnerabilities of suppliers through supply chain attacks. Further, cyber security and information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased because of, among other things, the growth of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including computers, smartphones, and other mobile devices outside the Company’s systems) by customers to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, fraudsters, hackers, terrorists, activists, instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties. Although the Company believes that a robust suite of authentication and layered security controls, data encryption and tokenization, threat intelligence, anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management tools exist, the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Further, as the Company expands its mobile and digital capabilities, cyber security risks increase.A disruption or breach, including as a result of a cyber security attack, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at the Company or at third-party service providers, could result in significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, remediation costs, damage to reputation or loss of confidence in the security of systems, products and services that could adversely affect the Company’s business. Like other U.S. financial services providers, M&T continues to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cyber security threats from sophisticated third parties. Although the Company is not aware of any material losses relating to cyber security incidents, there can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cyber security incidents will not become known or occur or that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future. The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damageThe Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage. New customer privacy initiatives will impose additional operational burdens on the Company, may limit the Company’s ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data. Significant examples include the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the Company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions for breach of such laws and regulations.As privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, they may also limit how companies like M&T can use customer data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such 48data. The time and resources needed for the Company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. The impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions.M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company’s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to the Company’s third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the Company. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors’ use of common service providers.The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.Many aspects of the Company’s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries’ business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk with respect to its obligations to indemnify directors and officers of it and its subsidiaries in connection with certain legal matters as well as in situations where it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued 49for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Many financial institutions, including the Company, have received inquiries from the United States Congress, regulators and other government authorities regarding implementation of provisions and programs under the CARES Act, and may also face the risk of litigation concerning their participation in the PPP under that Act. The Company’s involvement in these and other programs created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to additional government and regulatory inquiries and litigation in the future, any of which could negatively impact the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.Business RiskChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations.  In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company’s prior period financial statements. Information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 27 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K.The Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management’s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company’s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.50The Company’s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.The Company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values, among other uses. The Company uses models throughout many of its business lines, relying on them, along with its judgement, for many decision making processes.  Examples of areas where the Company uses models include determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels. The Company also uses models to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  Models generally evaluate the performance of various factors under anticipated future conditions, relying on historical data to help build the model and in part on assumptions as to the future, often with respect to macro-economic conditions, in order to generate the output. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models, including in the choice of relevant historical data or future-looking assumptions,  present the risk that the Company’s business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information, which may damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations. Even if the underlying assumptions used in the Company’s models are adequate, the models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.  As a result, the Company’s models may not fully capture or express the risks the Company faces, may suggest that the Company has sufficient capital when it may not, or may lead the Company to misjudge the business and economic environment in which it operates.  If the models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, the Company may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Furthermore, strategies that the Company employs to manage and govern the risks associated with its use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, the Company may realize losses or other lapses. Finally, information the Company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that the Company’s regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to M&T’s stockholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.The Company is exposed to reputational risk.A negative public opinion of the Company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the Company’s lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to the Company’s reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the Company’s contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. A service disruption of the Company’s technology platforms or an impact to the Company’s branches could have a negative impact on a customer’s access to banking services, and harm the Company’s reputation with customers. In particular, a cyber security event impacting the Company’s or its customers’ data could have a negative impact on the Company’s reputation and customer confidence in the Company and its cyber security. Damage to the Company’s reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets.51Additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to the Company’s reputation.The Company’s framework for managing risks may not be effective.The Company’s risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage its risk exposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework’s underlying assumptions, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, and operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. There are inherent limitations to the Company’s risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Company relies on both qualitative and quantitative factors, including models, to monitor, measure and analyze certain risks and to estimate certain financial values, which are subject to error. The Company must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among its employees, as well as manage risks associated with third parties, and could fail to do so effectively. If the Company’s risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences, and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations.Pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could significantly impact the Company’s business. Pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events, including severe weather and other natural disasters, could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.The Company’s assets, communities, operations, reputation and customers could be adversely affected by the impacts of climate risk. The Company operates in regions where its businesses and the activities of its customers could be negatively impacted by climate risk.This includes the physical risks resulting from chronic shifts in climate, such as rising average global temperatures and rising sea levels, and an increase in the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and natural disasters, including floods, wildfires, hurricanes and tornados. Such chronic shifts and events could damage or otherwise impact the value or productivity of customers’ assets and disrupt the Company’s operations and the operations of customers or third parties on which the Company relies. They could also result in market volatility, negatively impact  the Company’s customers’ ability to repay outstanding loans, and damage or deteriorate the value of collateral. Over time such risks may result in both increasing premiums for and reduced availability of insurance and have a broader impact on the economy.52Further, climate risk may manifest from efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy. Transition risks may arise from changes in consumer and business preferences, legislation, regulation, policy, and technological advancement associated with the changes necessary to limit climate change. Such risks may result in increased expenses or otherwise adversely impact the Company and its customers, including the ability of customers to repay outstanding loans. The Company could experience increased expenses resulting from climate-related strategic planning and market changes, as well as litigation and reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced investor and stakeholder confidence due to its climate change strategy and responses. Ongoing legislative or regulatory uncertainties and changes regarding appropriate climate risk management and practices may also result in higher regulatory, compliance and other expenses.Discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts’ estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies"

M&T and its subsidiaries face a number of potential risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company’s financial instruments and M&T’s common stock. The Company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company.Risks Relating to COVID-19 Pandemic M&T’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations have been, and will likely continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) pandemic has caused severe disruption to the U.S. and global economy and created significant volatility in the financial markets.  The duration of this disruption and impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.The pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect the Company’s business, financial condition, capital and results of operations will depend on future developments, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness and distribution of vaccines and other public health measures, the continued effectiveness of M&T’s business continuity plans, the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on the Company’s employees, customers, clients, counterparties, vendors, service providers and other market participants, and actions taken by 28governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted.The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to: •Increased unemployment levels, interrupted income of consumers and decreased consumer confidence generally, leading to an increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and foreclosures; •Increased disruption to businesses, permanent or temporary closure of businesses and decreased business confidence generally, leading to increased risk of delinquencies, defaults and bankruptcies; •A sudden and significant reduction in the valuation of the equity, fixed-income and commodity markets and the significant increase in the volatility of those markets; •A decrease in the rates and yields on U.S. Treasury securities, which has negatively impacted the Company’s net interest income and margin; •Declines in collateral values; •Increased demands on capital and liquidity, leading M&T to cease repurchases of its common stock in 2020; •A reduction in the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for customers, affecting related fee income and demand for the Company’s services; •Heightened cybersecurity, information security and operational risks to the Company, including as a result of remote work arrangements for employees and increased digital and mobile banking activities by customers; •Disruptions to the business operations of the Company, including temporary branch closures and disruptions to branch and office openings, supply chains and employee travel and working arrangements; and •Disruptions to business operations at counterparties, vendors and other service providers. The pandemic is likely to continue to contribute to these risks and impacts and could affect geographic areas in which the Company operates differently as further noted herein under “Market Risk” and “Credit Risk.” As a result, the Company’s credit, operational and other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides. In addition, the Company’s business operations continue to be at risk of adverse disruption if significant portions of the Company’s workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, failures in systems or technology that disrupt remote work arrangements or other effects of the pandemic, or if the Company is unable to keep branches or offices open, including because of risk of infection.Governmental authorities have taken unprecedented measures to provide economic assistance to individual households and businesses, stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is not yet entirely known and those measures may not be sufficient to fully mitigate the negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, some measures, such as a suspension of mortgage and other loan payments and foreclosures, may have a negative impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations. If such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company’s borrowers, the Company may also experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periods. The Company also faces an increased risk of litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions. Furthermore, various government programs such as the Paycheck Protection Program are complex and the 29Company’s participation may lead to litigation and governmental, regulatory and third party scrutiny, negative publicity and damage to its reputation.The length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the measures being put in place to address it are unknown. It is unknown when there will be a return to normal business activity and a subsiding of the economic stress associated with the pandemic. Prolonged continuation of the pandemic could worsen these risks and impacts. Until the pandemic subsides, the Company expects the potential for reduced revenues in many of its fee-related businesses and increased customer and client defaults, including defaults in unsecured loans. Even after the pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy may experience a prolonged economic slowdown or recession, and M&T anticipates the Company’s businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged economic slowdown or recession. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects the Company’s business, financial condition, liquidity, capital or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section and M&T’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Market RiskWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have adverse effects on the Company’s business including: •A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company. •A decrease in net interest income derived from the Company’s lending and deposit gathering activities. •A decrease in the value of the Company’s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. •Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Company’s investment securities portfolio or other investments.  •A decrease in fees from the Company’s brokerage, trust, and investment management businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. •Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels. •An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. •An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.The Company’s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.As a result of the high percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, including in the shape of the 30yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the Company’s business and profitability and the value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. For example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may: •Affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company’s overall net interest income and profitability. •Adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the Company’s loss rates on those assets. •Decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposits. •Affect the Company’s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. •Affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations.The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve’s policies influence, to a significant extent, the Company’s cost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.The forecasted discontinuation of LIBOR and uncertainty related to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace LIBOR could adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and a significant portion of the  Company’s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or to an alternative index, currency, basket or other financial metric. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling its panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement created market uncertainty as to 31whether and to what extent panel banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and as to the continued existence of LIBOR after 2021. In this context, it has been impossible to predict whether and for how long LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what new or existing benchmark rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any changes in industry views or alternatives may be on the functioning of LIBOR or the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.Following the FCA announcement in 2017, regulators and various financial industry groups sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“AARC”)) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace LIBOR, and publish recommended practices for transitioning the market away from LIBOR, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based repurchase transactions.  The fact that SOFR is a secured rate and considered a “risk free” rate, while LIBOR is an unsecured rate that factors in credit risk, means that SOFR may perform differently than LIBOR, and those differences may be material, particularly in times of economic stress, negatively impacting the Company’s profitability.  Over the past few years, the AARC’s recommendations and proposals have evolved, and the Company has continued to monitor both ARRC and general market developments.  While the ARRC has maintained its recommendation that SOFR is the preferred replacement for LIBOR, some industry participants are questioning whether a “risk free” SOFR rate is an ideal replacement for LIBOR in the commercial lending market and suggesting that a credit-sensitive component or alternative be considered and developed. Whether this or other alternatives develop and gain any traction in the market are unknown and unpredictable, and this adds further uncertainty to the LIBOR transition process, both with respect to amending existing LIBOR contracts and pricing new contracts based on SOFR or an alternative reference rate going forward.In October 2020, The International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA), published the IBOR Fallbacks Supplement (Supplement) and IBOR Fallbacks Protocol (Protocol).  The Supplement, which becomes effective on January 25, 2021, amends existing standard definitions for interest rate derivatives to incorporate robust fallbacks to the SOFR benchmark for derivatives linked to LIBOR.  The Protocol enables market participants to incorporate these revisions into their legacy non-cleared derivatives trades with other counterparties that choose to adhere to the Protocol.  The fallbacks apply following a permanent cessation of LIBOR or following a determination by the FCA that LIBOR is no longer representative of the its underlying market. M&T and M&T Bank adhered to the Protocol on November 5, 2020, and the Company is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap hedging transactions with its end user customers, i.e., borrowers who have hedged their interest rate payment obligations.  There is a possibility that the Company’s end-user customers may not adhere to the Protocol, which would necessitate one-on-one negotiation with each such customer to amend legacy interest rate derivatives.  If the Company is not able to agree to appropriate LIBOR fallbacks with these customers, there will be uncertainty as to how to value and effect the Company’s rights and obligations under legacy derivatives contracts.  With respect to the Company’s cleared interest rate derivatives that reference LIBOR, although the Supplement and Protocol do not apply to such cleared derivatives, both the CME and LCH clearinghouses plan on adopting the same relevant SOFR benchmark fallbacks of the Supplement and Protocol on the date that the Supplement and Protocol become effective.         The Company has outstanding issuances across various maturities of securities referencing LIBOR in which the underlying contracts do not contemplate cessation or contemplate cessation but 32do so in a manner that may create other risks.  Some of the contracts provide for selecting replacement rates in a manner that presents significant challenges or that gives the Company or another party discretion to select a rate or provide for determination of a reference rate.  In these types of cases, there will likely be uncertainty surrounding the transition. In November 2020, (i) public statements issued by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA), the administrator of LIBOR, and the FCA, announced a proposal to, among other things, extend the publication of the most commonly utilized tenors of LIBOR until June 30, 2023, and (ii) a joint-statement of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, indicated support for the IBA proposal and encouraged banks to (a)  transition away from LIBOR as soon as practicable, (b) cease (with limited exceptions) entering into new contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable and no later than December 31, 2021, and (c) for new contracts entered into before December 31, 2021, either utilize a reference rate other than LIBOR or include robust fallback language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after LIBOR’s discontinuation, noting that failure to do so would create safety and soundness risks.The discontinuation of LIBOR or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to the Company’s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company has issued or owns. A substantial portion of the Company’s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2021, and others that extend beyond 2023) are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. Uncertainty as to the timing and impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR, the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative index, and the operational feasibility of amending existing contracts referencing LIBOR to reference a replacement index could result in pricing volatility, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.The market’s transition from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate will be complex and unpredictable, giving rise to a variety of risks, including operational risks, risks of value transfer between contract parties, the potential for customer disputes and litigation, as well as regulatory scrutiny, as the most recent regulatory announcements indicate that there will be increased regulatory focus on LIBOR transition in 2021 and beyond, which increases the Company’s risk related to regulatory compliance.The Company established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program in 2019, which now includes a LIBOR Transition Office with senior management level leadership and dedicated full-time employee staffing.  An impact assessment has been completed to identify on- and off-balance sheet exposures, systems, processes, models, customers, and employees affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR. The Company continues to develop and execute plans to transition products and contracts associated with LIBOR to alternative reference rates.  33The Company’s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.As most of the Company’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company’s performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility may: •Affect the value or liquidity of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. •Affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. •Affect M&T’s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and results of operations. •Affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company’s services. •Impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. In addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.The Company’s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company’s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. The credit quality of the Company’s borrowers may deteriorate for a number of reasons that are outside the Company’s control, including as a result of prevailing economic and market conditions and asset valuations. The trends and risks affecting borrower credit quality, particularly in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, have caused, and in the future may cause, the Company to experience impairment charges, which are drastic reductions in the recoverable value of an asset, increased purchase demands, wherein customers make withdrawals with minimum notice, higher costs (e.g., servicing, foreclosure, property maintenance), additional write-downs and losses and a potential impact to engage in lending transactions based on a reduction of customer deposits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.34Risks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory EnvironmentThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect consumers, depositors and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company’s sale and lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputational damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact the Company’s supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the Company’s activities.Any new regulatory requirements, changes to existing requirements, or changes to interpretations of requirements could require changes to the Company’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that have been enacted or proposed in recent months. These and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. For more information on the regulations to which the Company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see Part I, Item 1 — Business in this report.M&T may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.Bank holding companies, including M&T, are subject to capital and liquidity requirements and standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act (as amended by EGRRCPA) and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” under Part I, Item 1 —  Business.Regulators have and may, from time to time, implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, 35and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions, could be limited. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets. In addition, the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the Company’s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. EGRRCPA, the Tailoring Rules and other rulemaking have in some cases reduced the capital or liquidity requirements applicable to M&T (e.g., the Company is no longer subject to any LCR requirement, and the same is true for the finalized NSFR). However, Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on the Company will depend on the manner in which the revisions arising from Basel IV are implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as M&T.M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the Federal Reserve.Any decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T’s Board of Directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby M&T’s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. Prior to the public disclosure of a BHC’s CCAR results, the Federal Reserve will provide the BHC with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the BHC to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. The Federal Reserve may object to any capital plan in which a BHC’s regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. If the Federal Reserve objects to M&T’s capital plan, it could impose restrictions on M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T. M&T cannot be certain that the Federal Reserve will not object to future capital plans.In addition, Federal Reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a BHC’s ability to make quarterly capital distributions – dividends and common stock share repurchases – if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the BHC had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. As such, M&T’s ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of M&T’s control.In August 2020, the Federal Reserve Board provided M&T with an indicative Stress Capital Buffer of 2.5%. The indicative  Stress Capital Buffer of 2.5% is the floor under the regulatory capital rules. As a general matter, if M&T is unable to maintain capital in excess of these levels, it would be subject to limitations on its ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends and repurchasing stock. In addition, during 2020 the Federal Reserve implemented measures requiring all large bank holding companies to preserve capital through the suspension of share repurchase programs and capping common stock dividends at existing rates that do not exceed the average of the last four quarters’ earnings. These capital preservation actions applied to the third and fourth quarters of 2020.  36In December 2020, the Federal Reserve extended to the first half of 2021 modified restrictions, which limit dividends and repurchases to an amount based on income over the past year. These actions may be further extended or modified by the Federal Reserve as economic conditions develop. The COVID-19 pandemic may cause the Company to further extend the suspension of its share repurchase program and limit capital distributions, including reducing or suspending its common stock dividend. In addition, if, as in June 2020, the Company is required to resubmit its capital plan, the Company generally may not make capital distributions, such as share repurchases or dividends, without the prior approval of the Federal Reserve.If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (“OLF”).The Dodd-Frank Act created a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Credit RiskDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans and other obligations in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans and obligations may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and entering into other financial arrangements.Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio, including in the New York City area; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. The Company’s credit risk and the performance of its lending portfolios may be affected by concentration in an industry, geography or asset type. Also, as described further in the risk factor above, the Company’s credit risks have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides. The 37pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected, and are likely to continue to adversely affect, customers, including businesses in the hotel and travel industry.In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and to support its customers, the Company has offered payment deferrals and other expanded assistance to businesses and consumers, and, during 2020, committed in certain states in which it operates to suspend mortgage payments and foreclosure sales for financially impacted customers for certain periods of time. A significant number of the Company’s customers sought to suspend their mortgage payments under these programs. Suspensions of mortgage payments and foreclosures and reduced pricing under these programs may adversely affect the Company’s revenue and results of operations. In addition, if these programs are not effective in mitigating the financial consequences of COVID-19 on customers, or if customers are unable to pay their loans after these programs expire, the Company may experience higher rates of default, increased credit losses and additional increases to the allowance for credit losses in future periods.Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers, including as impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, as described above.The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management’s judgment, the amount of losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2020 appropriately reflects expected credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover all credit losses that may occur.The Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit due to or derivative exposure of the Company. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Liquidity RiskThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, 38interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The Company’s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the Company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and funding. Such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the Company’s credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the Company’s ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T’s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.Regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact the Company’s results of operations and competitive position. Various regulations have been adopted to impose more stringent liquidity requirements for large financial institutions, including the Company. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing and minimum liquidity requirements. The application of certain of these regulations to banking organizations, such as the Company, have been modified, including in connection with the implementation of the tailoring rules in the EGRRCPA.  While marginal relief from certain capital and liquidity standards has been afforded to the Company (such as relief from LCR compliance), overall capital and liquidity management practices and expectations will remain unchanged for the foreseeable future. Moreover, the Company does not anticipate significant changes to its overall liquidity and capital levels or composition as a result of the final rules.If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company’s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The Company may also need to raise additional capital and liquidity through the issuance of stock, which could dilute the ownership of existing stockholders, or reduce or even eliminate common stock dividends or share repurchases to preserve capital and liquidity. If the Company is unable to maintain or grow its deposits, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs.The total amount that the Company pays for funding costs is dependent, in part, on the Company’s ability to maintain or grow its deposits. If the Company is unable to sufficiently maintain or grow its deposits to meet liquidity objectives, it may be subject to paying higher funding costs. The Company competes with banks and other financial services companies for deposits. If competitors raise the rates they pay on deposits, the Company’s funding costs may increase, either because the Company raises rates to avoid losing deposits or because the Company loses deposits and must rely on more 39expensive sources of funding. Customers may also move noninterest-bearing deposits to interest bearing accounts, increasing the cost of those deposits. Checking and savings account balances and other forms of customer deposits may decrease when customers perceive alternative investments, such as the stock market, as providing a better risk/return tradeoff. The Company’s bank customers could withdraw their money and put it in alternative investments, causing the Company to lose a lower cost source of funding. Higher funding costs could reduce the Company’s net interest margin and net interest income.M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are M&T’s principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T’s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See Item 1 —  Business, Distributions” for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on M&T’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock.Strategic Risk The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company’s revenue and profitability.The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Financial technology providers, 40who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the OCC’s fintech charter. As a result, the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. Further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company’s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.M&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including: •Inability to fully achieve the Company’s strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. •Issues arising during transition and integration. •Disruption of the Company’s business and diversion of management’s time and attention. •Exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions. •Loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions. •Dilution in the ownership percentage of holders of M&T common stock. •Payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company’s tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and long-term. •Inability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity (for example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity). •Changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities. M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.M&T’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the Company engages and markets that the Company serves is significant, and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company’s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. The Company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the Company does. If the Company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive 41compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.Operational Risk The Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error or misconduct, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events, including the risk of loss resulting from fraud by employees or persons outside the company, and breaches in data security. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company’s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company’s reputation or foregone business opportunities.  As described further in the risk factor above, the Company’s operational risks have been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides.The Company’s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security, including due to events beyond the Company’s control.The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company’s customer relationships. Disruption of operating systems caused by events beyond the Company’s control  may include computer viruses, electrical or telecommunications outages, quality of vulnerability patches, cyber security attacks (including Distributed Denial of Service attacks, which occur when legitimate users are unable to access information systems, devices, or other network resources due to the actions of a malicious cyber threat actor), damage to property or physical assets, or events arising from political protests or terrorist acts. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, disruption, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as digital and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities 42of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber security attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been numerous instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors, or the freezing of operating systems and databases making them inaccessible or unusable. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information or for restoring access to, or the usage of, operating systems and databases. Ransomware is a form of malicious software, known as “malware,” designed to block access to, and often encrypt, computer systems or data. Once the victim’s computer system or data is locked down and encrypted, rendering it essentially useless, the malicious cyber actor then extorts the victim by demanding a ransom payment in exchange for providing a method to decrypt it. The attacker may also copy the victim’s data in the course of the attack and threaten to sell or publish the data if the ransom is not paid. Ransomware attacks can result in a loss of business functionality and of sensitive data. As cyber security threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber security criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees, customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.Further, third parties with which the Company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the Company’s customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the Company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Company’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the Internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Company’s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Company or its customers, thereby increasing the Company’s operational costs and adversely affecting its business. Additionally, successful cyber security attacks at other large financial institutions, whether or not the Company is impacted, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence in financial institutions that could negatively affect M&T, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company’s security measures or the financial system in general which could result in reduced use of the Company’s financial products. Though the Company has insurance against some cyber security risks and attacks, it may not be sufficient to offset the impact of a material loss event.The Company continues to expand its use of cloud service providers, which providers could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber security-attacks, negative changes to financial condition, bankruptcy, or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and reputation. Thus, increasing the amount of infrastructure that the Company outsources to the cloud or to other third parties may increase M&T’s risk exposure. The Company could incur higher costs, experience lower revenue, and suffer reputational damage in the event of the theft, loss or misuse of information, including due to a cyber security attack. Like other financial services firms, the systems, networks and devices of the Company, its customers, employees, service providers or other third parties with whom the Company interacts continue to be 43the subject of attempted unauthorized access, denial-of-service attacks, computer viruses, hacking, malware, ransomware, phishing or other forms of social engineering, and cyber security attacks designed to obtain confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, eliminate access or cause other damage. These threats may arise from human error, fraud on the part of employees, insiders or third parties or may result from accidental technology failure. Further, cyber security and information security risks for financial institutions have generally increased because of, among other things, the growth of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including computers, smartphones, and other mobile devices outside the Company’s systems) by customers to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, fraudsters, hackers, terrorists, activists, instrumentalities of foreign governments and other external parties. Although the Company believes that a robust suite of authentication and layered security controls, data encryption and tokenization, threat intelligence, anti-malware defenses and vulnerability management tools exits, the failure of any of these controls could result in a failure to detect, mitigate or remediate these risks in a timely manner. Further, as the Company expands its mobile and digital capabilities, the number of attempted cyber security attacks may increase.A disruption or breach, including as a result of a cyber security attack, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities at the Company or at third-party service providers, could result in significant legal and financial exposure, regulatory intervention, remediation costs, damage to reputation or loss of confidence in the security of systems, products and services that could adversely affect the Company’s business. Like other U.S. financial services providers, M&T continues to be targeted with evolving and adaptive cyber security threats from sophisticated third parties. Although the Company is not aware of any material losses relating to cyber security incidents, there can be no assurance that unauthorized access or cyber security incidents will not become known or occur or that the Company will not suffer such losses in the future.  The Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage The Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage. New customer privacy initiatives will impose additional operational burdens on the Company, may limit the Company’s ability to pursue desirable business initiatives and increase the risks associated with any future use of customer data. Significant examples include the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the Company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties, litigation or regulatory enforcement actions for breach of such laws and regulations.As privacy-related laws and regulations are implemented, they may also limit how companies like M&T can use customer data and impose obligations on companies in their management of such data. The time and resources needed for the Company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. The impacts will be greater to the extent requirements vary across jurisdictions.44M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company’s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to our third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the Company. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors’ use of common service providers.The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.Many aspects of the Company’s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries’ business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk with respect to its obligations to indemnify directors and officers of it and its subsidiaries in connection with certain legal matters as well as in situations where it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.45Many financial institutions, including the Company, have received inquiries from the United States Congress, regulators and other government agencies regarding implementation of provisions and programs under the CARES Act, and may also face the risk of litigation concerning their participation in the PPP under that Act. The Company’s involvement in these and other programs created in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may lead to additional government and regulatory inquiries and litigation in the future, any of which could negatively impact the Company’s business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.Business RiskChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. For example, Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, became effective January 1, 2020, and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company’s prior period financial statements. Information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 26 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K.The Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management’s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company’s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be 46incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.The Company’s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.The Company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values, among other uses. The Company uses models throughout many of its business lines, relying on them, along with its judgement, for many decision making processes.  Examples of areas where the Company uses models include determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy, and calculating economic and regulatory capital levels. The Company also uses models to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items.  Models generally evaluate the performance of various factors under anticipated future conditions, relying on historical data to help build the model and in part on assumptions as to the future, often with respect to macro-economic conditions, in order to generate the output. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models, including in the choice of relevant historical data or future-looking assumptions,  present the risk that the Company’s business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information, which may damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations. Even if the underlying assumptions used in the Company’s models are adequate, the models may be deficient due to errors in computer code, use of bad data during development or input into the model during model use, or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the model’s design.  As a result, the Company’s models may not fully capture or express the risks the Company faces, may suggest that the Company has sufficient capital when it may not, or may lead the Company to misjudge the business and economic environment in which it operates.  If the models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis, the Company may not make appropriate risk management, capital planning, or other business or financial decisions. Furthermore, strategies that the Company employs to manage and govern the risks associated with its use of models may not be effective or fully reliable, and as a result, the Company may realize losses or other lapses. Finally, information the Company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models or misused models could be inaccurate or misleading. Some of the decisions that the Company’s regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to M&T’s stockholders, could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.The Company is exposed to reputational risk.A negative public opinion of the Company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the Company’s lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to the Company’s reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the Company’s contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. A service disruption of the Company’s technology platforms or an impact to the Company’s branches could have a negative impact on a customer’s access to banking 47services, and harm the Company’s reputation with customers. In particular, a cyber security event impacting the Company’s or its customers’ data could have a negative impact on the Company’s reputation and customer confidence in the Company and its cyber security. Damage to the Company’s reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets.Additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to the Company’s reputation. The Company’s framework for managing risks may not be effective. The Company’s risk management framework is made up of various processes and strategies to manage its risk exposure. The framework to manage risk, including the framework’s underlying assumptions, may not be effective under all conditions and circumstances. If the risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could suffer unexpected losses and could be materially adversely affected.The Company has established processes and procedures intended to identify, measure, monitor, report, and analyze the types of risk to which it is subject, including liquidity risk, credit risk, market risk, interest rate risk, compliance risk, strategic risk, reputation risk, and operational risk related to its employees, systems and vendors, among others. There are inherent limitations to the Company’s risk management strategies as there may exist, or develop in the future, risks that it has not appropriately anticipated or identified. In addition, the Company relies on both qualitative and quantitative factors, including models, to monitor, measure and analyze certain risks and to estimate certain financial values, which are subject to error. The Company must also develop and maintain a culture of risk management among its employees, as well as manage risks associated with third parties, and could fail to do so effectively. If the Company’s risk management framework proves ineffective, the Company could incur litigation and negative regulatory consequences, and suffer unexpected losses that could affect its financial condition or results of operations.Severe weather, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company’s business.Severe weather, natural disasters, pandemics, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.48In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts’ estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies"
18,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2020-02-20,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict. As a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company’s financial instruments and M&T’s common stock. The Company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company.Market RiskWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have adverse effects on the Company’s business including: •A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company. •A decrease in net interest income derived from the Company’s lending and deposit gathering activities. •A decrease in the value of the Company’s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. •Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Company’s investment securities portfolio or other investments.  •A decrease in fees from the Company’s brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. •Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels. •An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. •An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.The Company’s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.As a result of the high percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the Company’s business and profitability and the value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. For example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may: •Affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the 26 interest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company’s overall net interest income and profitability. •Adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the Company’s loss rates on those assets. •Decrease the demand for interest rate-based products and services, including loans and deposits. •Affect the Company’s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. •Affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations.The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve’s policies influence, to a significant extent, the Company’s cost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.The forecasted discontinuation of LIBOR and the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indices to replace LIBOR could adversely impact the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the  Company’s products, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling its panel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent panel banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR, such that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether and for how long LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what new or existing benchmark rate or rates may become accepted 27alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in industry views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.Regulators and various financial industry groups have sponsored or formed committees (e.g., the Federal Reserve-sponsored Alternative Reference Rates Committee) to, among other things, facilitate the identification of an alternative benchmark index to replace LIBOR, and publish consultations on recommended practices for transitioning away from LIBOR, including (i) the utilization of recommended fallback language for LIBOR-linked financial instruments, and (ii) development of alternative pricing methodologies for recommended alternative benchmarks such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on directly observable U.S. Treasury-based repurchase transactions.  At this time, it is still not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted in the market, whether they will continue to evolve, and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments.The discontinuation of LIBOR or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to the Company’s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company has issued or owns. A substantial portion of the Company’s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2021) are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings. In addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.The Company established an enterprise-wide LIBOR transition program in 2019.  An impact assessment has been completed to identify on- and off-balance sheet exposures, systems, processes, models, customers, and employees affected by the discontinuation of LIBOR.  The Company continues to develop and execute plans to transition products associated with LIBOR to alternative reference rates.  The Company’s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.As most of the Company’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company’s performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility may: •Affect the value or liquidity of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. •Affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. •Affect M&T’s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and results of operations.28 •Affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company’s services. •Impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets. In addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.The Company’s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company’s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.Risks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory EnvironmentThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company’s lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time. In addition, enforcement matters could impact the Company’s supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the Company’s activities.29Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the Company’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that have been enacted or proposed in recent months. These and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain. For more information on the regulations to which the Company is subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see Part I, Item 1 — Business in this report.M&T may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements.Bank holding companies, including M&T, are subject to capital and liquidity standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act (as amended by EGRRCPA) and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” under Part I, Item 1 —  Business.From time to time, regulators may implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity requirements. If the Company fails to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, its business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions, could be limited. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets. In addition, the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements may reduce the Company’s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. EGRRCPA, the Tailoring Rules and other recent rulemaking have in some cases reduced the capital or liquidity requirements applicable to M&T (e.g., the Company is no longer subject to any LCR requirement, and the same is expected to be true for any finalized NSFR). However, Basel IV significantly revises the Basel capital framework, and the impact on the Company will depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the U.S. with respect to firms such as M&T.M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the Federal Reserve.Any decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T’s Board of Directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby M&T’s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. Prior to the public disclosure of a BHC’s CCAR results, the Federal Reserve will provide the BHC with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the BHC to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. The Federal Reserve may object to any capital plan in which a BHC’s regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements 30throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. If the Federal Reserve objects to M&T’s capital plan, it could impose restrictions on M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T. M&T cannot be certain that the Federal Reserve will not object to future capital plans.In addition, Federal Reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a BHC’s ability to make quarterly capital distributions – dividends and common stock share repurchases – if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the BHC had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. As such, M&T’s ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of M&T’s control.If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (“OLF”).The Dodd-Frank Act created a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Credit RiskDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans.Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers.31Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management’s judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2019 appropriately reflects incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance is sufficient to cover such credit losses.The Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Liquidity RiskThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The Company’s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the Company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and funding. Such reputational damage may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the Company’s credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the 32Company’s ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T’s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company’s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are M&T’s principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T’s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See Item 1 —  Business, Distributions” for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on M&T’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock.Strategic Risk The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company’s revenue and profitability.The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic 33diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the OCC’s fintech charter. As a result, the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network. Further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company’s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.M&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. Acquiring other entities involves potential risks that could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including: •Inability to fully achieve the Company’s strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. •Issues arising during transition and integration. •Disruption of the Company’s business and diversion of management’s time and attention. •Exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of acquired institutions. •Loss of key employees and customers of acquired institutions. •Dilution in the ownership percentage of holders of M&T common stock. •Payment of a premium over book and market values that may dilute the Company’s tangible book value and earnings per common share in the short and long-term. •Inability to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity (for example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity). •Changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that could impair or eliminate the expected benefits of merger and acquisition activities.34Operational Risk The Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company’s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company’s reputation or foregone business opportunities.M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.M&T’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the Company engages and markets that the Company serves is significant, and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company’s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. The Company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the Company does. If the Company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.The Company’s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company’s customer relationships. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.35Information security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties. There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These techniques may include attempts to fraudulently induce employees, customers or others to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.Further, third parties with which the Company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the Company’s customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the Company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Company’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the Internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Company’s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Company or its customers, thereby increasing the Company’s operational costs and adversely affecting its business.The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company’s systems or those of third-party service providers (or, in turn, providers to such third-party providers), particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential sanctions, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.The Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as the cybersecurity regulation of the NYSDFS, are implemented, the time and resources needed for the Company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. In addition, the Company is increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the Company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations.M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher 36volumes of use could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company’s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.Additionally, the Company is exposed to the risk that a service disruption at a common service provider to our third-party service providers could impede their ability to provide services to the Company. Notwithstanding any attempts to diversify its reliance on third parties, the Company may not be able to effectively mitigate operational risks relating to its vendors’ use of common service providers.The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.Many aspects of the Company’s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries’ business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Business RiskChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting 37standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. For example, Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, became effective January 1, 2020, and substantially changes the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets. The adoption of the standard has resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses of approximately $132 million. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company’s prior period financial statements. Information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 26 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 — Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K.The Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations depend on management’s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company’s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7 — Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.The Company’s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.The Company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models present the risk that the Company’s business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information, which may damage the Company’s reputation and adversely affect its reported financial condition and results of operations. As a result, the Company may not adequately prepare for future 38events and may suffer losses due to these failures. Also, information the Company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading. Decisions that regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to stockholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.The Company is exposed to reputational risk.A negative public opinion of the Company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the Company’s lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to the Company’s reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the Company’s contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. In particular, a cyber security event impacting the Company’s or its customers’ data could have a negative impact on the Company’s reputation and customer confidence in the Company and its cyber security. Damage to the Company’s reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets.Additionally, whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media, the increased use of social media platforms facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation, which magnifies the potential harm to the Company’s reputation.Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company’s business.Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts’ estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies.39"
3,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2019-02-20,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company’s financial instruments and M&T’s common stock.  The Company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company.Market RiskWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have adverse effects on the Company’s business including: •A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company. •A decrease in net interest income derived from the Company’s lending and deposit gathering activities. •A decrease in the value of the Company’s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. •Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Company’s investment securities portfolio or other investments.  •A decrease in fees from the Company’s brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. •Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels. •An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. •An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.The Company’s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.As a result of the high percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the Company’s business and profitability and the value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. For example, changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads may: •Affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the 28 interest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company’s overall net interest income and profitability. •Adversely affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, which, in turn, affects the Company’s loss rates on those assets. •Decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. •Affect the Company’s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. •Affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations.The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking organizations such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve’s policies influence, to a significant extent, the Company’s cost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in the method pursuant to which LIBOR and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations.Our floating-rate funding, certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer, such as floating-rate loans and mortgages, determine the applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), or to an index, currency, basket or other financial metric. LIBOR and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) announced that the FCA intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after 2021. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-linked financial instruments.29The discontinuation of LIBOR, changes in LIBOR or changes in market perceptions of the acceptability of LIBOR as a benchmark could result in changes to the Company’s risk exposures (for example, if the anticipated discontinuation of LIBOR adversely affects the availability or cost of floating-rate funding and, therefore, the Company’s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates) or otherwise result in losses on a product or having to pay more or receive less on securities that the Company owns or has issued. A substantial portion of the Company’s on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments (many of which have terms that extend beyond 2021) are indexed to LIBOR, including interest rate swap agreements and other contracts used for hedging and trading account purposes, loans to commercial customers and consumers (including mortgage loans and other loans), and long-term borrowings.  In addition, such uncertainty could result in pricing volatility and increased capital requirements, loss of market share in certain products, adverse tax or accounting impacts, and compliance, legal and operational costs and risks.The Company’s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.As most of the Company’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company’s performance is sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility may: •Affect the value or liquidity of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. •Affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. •Affect M&T’s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and results of operations. •Affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company’s services. •Impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.  In addition, unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by the imposition of tariffs or other limitations on international trade and travel, which can result in market volatility, negatively impact client activity, and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.The Company’s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company’s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.30Risks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory EnvironmentThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company’s lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith.  In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements, which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution, including loss of customers, restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets, and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time.  In addition, enforcement matters could impact the Company’s supervisory and CRA ratings, which may in turn restrict or limit the Company’s activities.Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the Company’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There have been significant revisions to the laws and regulations applicable to the Company that have been enacted or proposed in recent months. These and other rules to implement the changes have yet to be finalized, and the final timing, scope and impact of these changes to the regulatory framework applicable to financial institutions remain uncertain.  For more information on the regulations to which we are subject and recent initiatives to reform financial institution regulation, see Part I, Item 1 — Business in this report.Capital and liquidity standards adopted by the U.S. banking regulators have resulted in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.Capital standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act (as amended by EGRRCPA) and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including M&T. The U.S. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” under Part I, Item 1 “Business.”31The requirement to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital and liquidity levels, could limit the Company’s business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets’ underlying risks.In addition, the U.S. Basel III-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement and the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements require the Company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the Company’s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, common stock share repurchases and acquisitions.Certain elements of these capital and liquidity standards may be eased in the future consistent with recently issued and anticipated proposals by the Federal banking agencies following the enactment of EGRRCPA. However, the ultimate timing and implementation of such relief is unclear and therefore the Company expects to remain subject to these standards in the near term.M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the Federal Reserve.Any decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T’s Board of Directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby M&T’s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. Prior to the public disclosure of a BHC’s CCAR results, the Federal Reserve will provide the BHC with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the BHC to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. The Federal Reserve may object to any capital plan in which a BHC’s regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. In January 2017, the Federal Reserve finalized a rule modifying the capital plan and stress testing rules for the 2017 cycle. The rule eliminated the qualitative component of CCAR for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion, such as M&T. The qualitative assessment considered factors including the comprehensiveness of a BHC’s capital plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the BHC had satisfied certain supervisory matters related to its processes, analyses, controls and governance. The Federal Reserve will continue to evaluate these factors through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning. If the Federal Reserve objects to M&T’s capital plan, it could impose restrictions on M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T. In June 2018, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to M&T’s revised capital plan; however, M&T cannot be certain that the Federal Reserve will not object to future capital plans.32In addition, Federal Reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a BHC’s ability to make quarterly capital distributions – dividends and common stock share repurchases – if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the BHC had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. As such, M&T’s ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of M&T’s control.Certain elements of these stress testing and capital planning requirements may be eased in the future consistent with recently issued and anticipated proposals by the Federal banking agencies following the enactment of EGRRCPA. However, the ultimate timing and implementation of such relief is unclear and therefore the Company expects to remain subject to these standards in the near term.The effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on M&T.Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $100 billion or more, such as M&T, are currently required to submit periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. M&T’s resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. The regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC prescribes specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s components, a description of the range of specific actions the Company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the Company’s organizational structure, material entities, core business lines, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. The most recent resolution plan for M&T was filed in December 2017. In addition, insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as M&T Bank, are required to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution’s failure.  M&T Bank submitted its most recent resolution plan in June 2018. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that the resolution plan of a BHC is not credible, and the company fails to cure the deficiencies in a timely manner, then the Federal Reserve and the FDIC may jointly impose on the company, or on any of its subsidiaries, more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth, activities or operations, or require the divestment of certain assets or operations. If the Federal Reserve and the FDIC jointly determine that M&T’s resolution plan is not credible or would not facilitate its orderly resolution under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, the Company could become subject to more stringent regulatory requirements or business restrictions, or have to divest certain of its assets or businesses. Any such measures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (“OLF”).The Dodd-Frank Act creates a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and 33impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Credit RiskDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans.Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers.Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management’s judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. The effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses.Management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. In those cases, the Company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income.34The Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships.  The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Liquidity RiskThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The Company’s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Negative news about the Company or the financial services industry generally may reduce market or customer confidence in the Company, which could in turn materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and funding. Such reputational damage   may result in the loss of customer deposits, the inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets, and downgrades in one or more of the Company’s credit ratings, and may also negatively affect the Company’ ability to access the capital markets. A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow funds, including by raising the cost of borrowings substantially, and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T’s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.Recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management have also impacted the Company’s results of operations and competitive position. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies.If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company’s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.35M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are M&T’s principal source of funds to pay dividends on common and preferred stock, pay interest and principal on its debt, and fund purchases of its common stock. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T’s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See “Item 1. Business — Distributions” for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on M&T’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt, and ability to fund purchases of its common stock.Strategic Risk The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company’s revenue and profitability.The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company is, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies has grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing.  The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and is changing the delivery channels for financial services. Financial technology providers, who invest substantial resources in developing and designing new technology (in particular digital and mobile technology), are beginning to offer more traditional banking products (either directly or through bank partnerships) and may in the future be able to provide additional services by obtaining a bank-like charter, such as the OCC’s fintech charter. As a result, the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.  Further, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that 36allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company’s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.M&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. M&T may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its actual or potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. The Company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Acquisition and integration activities require M&T to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result M&T may not be able to pursue other business opportunities while integrating acquired entities with the Company.After completing an acquisition, the Company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity.Operational Risk The Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company’s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company’s reputation or foregone business opportunities.M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.M&T’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities in which the Company engages and markets that the Company serves is significant, and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company’s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. The Company is increasingly competing for personnel with financial technology providers and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as the Company does. If the Company is not able to hire or retain highly skilled and qualified individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.37The Company’s compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the Federal Reserve, the OCC, the FDIC and other regulators. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.The Company’s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems, including those of third-party service providers, to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company’s customer relationships. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties.  There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated by a variety of actors, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or the Company’s systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.Further, third parties with which the Company does business, as well as vendors and other third parties with which the Company’s customers do business, can also be sources of information security risk to the Company, particularly where activities of customers are beyond the Company’s security and control systems, such as through the use of the Internet, personal computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile services. Security breaches affecting the Company’s customers, or systems breakdowns or failures, security breaches or employee misconduct affecting such other third parties, may require the Company to take steps to protect the integrity of its own systems or to safeguard confidential information of the Company or its customers, thereby increasing the Company’s operational costs and adversely affecting its business.The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company’s systems or those of third-party service providers (or, in turn, providers to such third-party providers), 38particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject the Company to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential sanctions, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.The Company is also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients, employees or others, and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose the Company to liability and/or reputational damage. As new privacy-related laws and regulations, such as the cybersecurity regulation of the NYSDFS, are implemented, the time and resources needed for the Company to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as its potential liability for non-compliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches, may significantly increase. In addition, the Company is increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, surveillance, encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Compliance with these laws and regulations may require changes to policies, procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data, which could, among other things, make the Company more vulnerable to operational failures, and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations.M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company’s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.Many aspects of the Company’s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries’ business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the 39amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Business RiskChanges in accounting standards could impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company’s prior period financial statements.  Information about recently adopted and not as yet adopted accounting standards is included in note 26 of Notes to Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 – Financial Statements and Supplemental Data of this Form 10-K.The Company’s reported  financial condition and results of operations depend on management’s selection of accounting methods and require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company’s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.40The Company’s models used for business planning purposes could perform poorly or provide inadequate information.The Company uses quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values. The models used may not accurately account for all variables and may fail to predict outcomes accurately and/or may overstate or understate certain effects. Poorly designed, implemented, or managed models present the risk that the Company’s business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to inadequate or inaccurate information. As a result, the Company may not adequately prepare for future events and may suffer losses due to these failures. Also, information the Company provides to the public or to its regulators based on poorly designed, implemented, or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading. Decisions that regulators make, including those related to capital distributions to stockholders, could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient.The Company is exposed to reputational risk.A negative public opinion of the Company and its business can result from any number of activities, including the Company’s lending practices, corporate governance and regulatory compliance, acquisitions and actions taken by regulators or by community organizations in response to these activities. Significant harm to the Company’s reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions, litigation, employee misconduct or the activities of customers, other participants in the financial services industry or the Company’s contractual counterparties, such as service providers and vendors. In particular, a cyber security event impacting the Company’s or its customers’ data could have a negative impact on the Company’s reputation and customer confidence in the Company and its cyber security. Damage to the Company’s reputation could also adversely affect its credit ratings and access to the capital markets.Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company’s business.Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.Discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.41In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts’ estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies"
15,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2018-02-22,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company’s financial instruments and M&T’s common stock.  The Company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company, although there may be additional risks that are not presently material or known that may adversely affect the Company.Market RiskWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the Company’s business: •A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company. •A decrease in net interest income derived from the Company’s lending and deposit gathering activities. •A decrease in the value of the Company’s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. •Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Company’s investment securities portfolio. •A decrease in fees from the Company’s brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. •Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels. •An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. •An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.The Company’s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.As a result of the high percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the Company’s business and profitability and the value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. For example: •Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the 27 interest that the Company earns on assets and the interest that the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Company’s overall net interest income and profitability. •Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect the Company’s loss rates on those assets. •Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. •Such changes can also affect the Company’s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. •Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations.The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve’s policies also influence, to a significant extent, the Company’s cost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. In December 2017, President Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act which is one of the most significant overhauls to the United States federal tax code since 1986 and could have a significant impact on domestic and international tax consequences. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.As most of the Company’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company’s performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the Company and its business, including adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations: •It can affect the value or liquidity of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.28 •It can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. •It can affect M&T’s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and results of operations. •It can affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company’s services. •In general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.The Company’s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.The Company’s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company’s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.Risks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory EnvironmentThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company’s lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy, growth and expansionary activity, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, can pursue aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith.The U.S. government and others have undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. M&T has been subject to increased regulation of its industry as a result of certain and possible future initiatives. M&T continues to expect scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with new regulations and supervisory initiatives could increase the Company’s costs, reduce its revenue and/or limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.29Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the Company’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, such activity could affect the behaviors of third parties with which the Company deals in the ordinary course of business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Capital and liquidity standards adopted by the U.S. banking regulators have resulted in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.Capital standards imposed as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including M&T. The U.S. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” under Part I, Item 1 “Business.”The requirement to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital and liquidity levels, could limit the Company’s business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets’ underlying risks.In addition, the U.S. Basel III-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement and the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements adopted pursuant to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act require the Company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the Company’s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, common stock share repurchases and acquisitions.M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the Federal Reserve.Any decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through a common stock dividend or through a common stock share repurchase program, requires the approval of M&T’s Board of Directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the Federal Reserve’s CCAR process and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby M&T’s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. Prior to the public disclosure of a BHC’s CCAR results, the Federal Reserve will provide the BHC with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the BHC to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. The Federal Reserve may object to any capital plan in which a BHC’s regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. In January 2017, the 30Federal Reserve finalized a rule modifying the capital plan and stress testing rules for the 2017 cycle. The rule eliminated the qualitative component of CCAR for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion, such as M&T. The qualitative assessment considered factors including the comprehensiveness of a BHC’s capital plan, the assumptions and analysis underlying the plan, and the extent to which the BHC had satisfied certain supervisory matters related to its processes, analyses, controls and governance. The Federal Reserve will continue to evaluate these factors through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning. If the Federal Reserve objects to M&T’s capital plan, it could impose restrictions on M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders, including through paying dividends, entering into acquisitions or repurchasing its common stock, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T. In June 2017, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to M&T’s capital plan; however, M&T cannot be certain that the Federal Reserve will not object to future capital plans submitted through the CCAR program.In addition, Federal Reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a BHC’s ability to make quarterly capital distributions – dividends and common stock share repurchases – if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the BHC had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. Under these rules, for example, if a BHC issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued (“net distributions”), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. As such, M&T’s ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of M&T’s control.The effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on M&T.Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. M&T’s resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. The regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC prescribes specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s components, a description of the range of specific actions the Company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the Company’s organizational structure, material entities, core business lines, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. The most recent resolution plan for M&T was filed in December 2017. In addition, insured depository institutions with $50 billion or more in total assets, such as M&T Bank, are required to submit to the FDIC periodic plans for resolution in the event of the institution’s failure.  M&T Bank submitted its most recent resolution plan in December 2015, as required. The next resolution plan for M&T Bank is required to be filed by July 1, 2018. To address effectively any shortcomings in the Company’s resolution plan, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC could require the Company to change its business structure or dispose of businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt.31 If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (“OLF”).The Dodd-Frank Act creates a mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be first made on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Credit RiskDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans.Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers.Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management’s judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. 32The effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses.Management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. In those cases, the Company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. The Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships.  The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Liquidity RiskThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The Company’s liquidity and ability to fund and operate the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the Company’s credit ratings. A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T’s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.33Recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management have also impacted the Company’s results of operations and competitive position. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies.If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company’s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on M&T stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T’s banking subsidiaries and certain non-bank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See “Item 1. Business — Distributions” for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on M&T’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt.Strategic Risk The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company’s revenue and profitability.The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company and its subsidiaries are, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies have grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing.  The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial 34services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.Operational Risk The Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company’s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. In addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allow it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company’s reputation or foregone business opportunities.Changes in accounting standards could impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company’s prior period financial statements.M&T’s accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company’s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.35Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company’s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.M&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. M&T may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its actual or potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. The Company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Acquisition and integration activities require M&T to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result M&T may not be able to pursue other business opportunities while integrating acquired entities with the Company.After completing an acquisition, the Company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity.M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.M&T’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals and to have a diverse workforce. Competition for qualified and diverse candidates in the activities and markets that the Company serves is significant and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company’s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. If the Company is not able to hire or retain these type of individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.36Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company’s business.Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.The Company’s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company’s customer relationships. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties.  There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or the Company’s systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company’s systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny and potential sanctions, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.Many aspects of the Company’s business and operations involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries’ business activities (and in some cases from the activities 37of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company’s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.Discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts’ estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies.38"
9,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2017-02-22,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by a number of risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.  As a financial institution certain risk elements are inherent in the ordinary course of the Company’s business activities and adverse experience with those risks could have a material impact on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the values of the Company’s financial instruments and M&T’s common stock.  The Company has developed a risk management process to identify, understand, mitigate and balance its exposure to significant risks. The following risk factors set forth some of the risks that could materially and adversely impact the Company.Market RiskWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect the Company in the future.Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the Company’s business: •A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company. •A decrease in net interest income derived from the Company’s lending and deposit gathering activities. •A decrease in the value of the Company’s investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial real estate. •Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Company’s investment securities portfolio. •A decrease in fees from the Company’s brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. •Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels. •An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill. •An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale.The Company’s business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates and movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no control and which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.As a result of the high percentage of the Company’s assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on the Company’s business and profitability and the value of the Company’s assets and liabilities. For example: •Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interest that the Company pays on 27 liabilities, which impacts the Company’s overall net interest income and profitability. •Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, in turn, affect the Company’s loss rates on those assets. •Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits. •Such changes can also affect the Company’s ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability or protection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges. •Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reduce the value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Company’s results of operations.The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate the national supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserve’s policies also influence, to a significant extent, the Company’s cost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that management’s assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Company’s results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Company’s business activities, financial condition and results of operations.The Company’s business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.As most of the Company’s assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Company’s performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the Company and its business, including adversely affecting the Company’s financial condition and results of operations: •It can affect the value or liquidity of the Company’s on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. •It can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets. •It can affect M&T’s ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates, could adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and results of operations.28 •It can affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directly impacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Company’s services. •In general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages.Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been and may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.The Company’s regional concentrations expose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.The Company’s core banking business is largely concentrated within the Company’s retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.Risks Relating to Compliance and the Regulatory EnvironmentThe Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment can be and has been significantly impacted by financial regulatory reform initiatives.The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors’ funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Company’s lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Company’s ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith.The U.S. government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. M&T expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. M&T also expects more intense scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the Company’s costs, reduce its revenue and may limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.Not all of the rules required or expected to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have been proposed or adopted, and certain of the rules that have been proposed or adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to phase-in or transitional periods. Reforms, both under the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. Although it 29is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects, M&T believes compliance with new regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit M&T’s ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the Company’s businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the Company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. While the change in administration in the U.S. may ultimately lead to the modification of certain of the regulations adopted since the financial crisis, uncertainty about the timing and scope of any such changes as well as the cost of complying with a new regulatory regime may negatively impact the Company’s businesses, at least in the short term, even if the long-term impact of any such changes may be positive for the Company’s businesses.Capital and liquidity standards adopted by the U.S. banking regulators have resulted in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.New capital standards, both as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the U.S. Basel III-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including M&T. The U.S. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. For additional information, see “Capital Requirements” under Part I, Item 1 “Business.”The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital and liquidity levels, could limit the Company’s business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets’ underlying risks.In addition, the U.S. Basel III-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement and the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserve’s liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements adopted pursuant to Section 165 of Dodd-Frank require the Company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the Company’s ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions.M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders and to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by the Federal Reserve.Any decision by M&T to return capital to shareholders, whether through an increase in its common stock dividend or through a share repurchase program, requires the approval of the M&T Board of Directors and depends in large part on receiving regulatory approval, including through the Federal 30Reserve’s CCAR process and the supervisory stress tests required under the Dodd-Frank Act whereby M&T’s financial position is tested under assumed severely adverse economic conditions. Prior to the public disclosure of a bank holding company’s CCAR results, the Federal Reserve will provide the BHC with the results of its supervisory stress test and will offer a one-time opportunity for the BHC to reduce planned capital distributions through the submission of a revised capital plan. The Federal Reserve may object to any capital plan in which a bank holding company’s regulatory capital ratios inclusive of adjustments to planned capital distributions, if any, would not meet the minimum requirements throughout a nine-quarter period under severely adverse stress conditions. In June 2016, the Federal Reserve announced that it did not object to M&T’s revised CCAR capital plan. In the future, if the Federal Reserve objects to M&T’s CCAR capital plan or raises concerns regarding the qualitative aspects of M&T’s capital planning process through its supervisory oversight of M&T, it could impose restrictions on M&T’s ability to return capital to shareholders, which in turn could negatively impact market and investor perceptions of M&T.In addition, Federal Reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a bank holding company’s ability to make quarterly capital distributions – that is, dividends and share repurchases – if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the BHC had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. Under these rules, for example, if a BHC issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued (“net distributions”), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. As such, M&T’s ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock in accordance with its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of M&T’s control.The effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on M&T.Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolution plan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. M&T’s resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risks arising from its other subsidiaries. The regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plan’s components, a description of the range of specific actions the Company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the Company’s organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. To address effectively any shortcomings in the Company’s resolution plan, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC could require the Company to change its business structure or dispose of businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. If an orderly liquidation of a systemically important BHC or non-bank financial company were triggered, M&T could face assessments for the Orderly Liquidation Fund (“OLF”).The Dodd-Frank Act creates a new mechanism, the OLF, for liquidation of systemically important bank holding companies and non-bank financial companies. The OLF is administered by the FDIC 31and is based on the FDIC’s bank resolution model. The Secretary of the U.S. Treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the President of the U.S. and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the FDIC and the Federal Reserve upon a two-thirds vote. Liquidation proceedings will be funded by the OLF, which will borrow from the U.S. Treasury and impose risk-based assessments on covered financial companies. Risk-based assessments would be made, first, on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess, and second, if necessary, on, among others, bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T. Any such assessments may adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition or results of operations.Credit RiskDeteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans.Factors that influence the Company’s credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Company’s real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Company’s credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Company’s loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Company’s portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers.Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance, and general economic conditions affecting consumers.The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in management’s judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by management’s evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. The effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses.Management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or 32the economy experiences a downturn. In those cases, the Company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income. The Company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships.  The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Company’s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.Liquidity RiskThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.The Company’s liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms. Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the Company’s liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the Company’s credit ratings. A downgrade in the Company’s credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Company’s ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&T’s ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.Recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management have also impacted the Company’s results of operations and competitive position. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies.33If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Company’s liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on M&T stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&T’s banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See “Item 1. Business — Dividends” for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&T’s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary’s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiary’s creditors. Limitations on M&T’s ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt.Strategic Risk The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Company’s revenue and profitability.The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. Some of the Company’s non-bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations the Company and its subsidiaries are, and may have greater flexibility in competing for business. In particular, the activity and prominence of so-called marketplace lenders and other technological financial services companies have grown significantly in recent years and is expected to continue growing.  The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Company’s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.34Operational Risk The Company is subject to operational risk which could adversely affect the Company’s business and reputation and create material legal and financial exposure.Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Company’s ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. In addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Company’s reputation or foregone business opportunities.Changes in accounting standards could impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Company’s prior period financial statements.M&T’s accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Company’s reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&T’s accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles, management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Company’s financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Company’s financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management’s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and 35contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Critical Accounting Estimates” and Note 1, “Significant Accounting Policies,” of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Company’s own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.M&T has expanded its business through past acquisitions and may do so in the future. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. M&T may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its actual or potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. The Company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Acquisition and integration activities require M&T to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result M&T may not be able to pursue other business opportunities while integrating acquired entities with the Company.After completing an acquisition, the Company may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize less revenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity.M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.M&T’s success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the Company serves is significant and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Company’s business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. If the Company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations.The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a banking organization’s incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Company’s performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.36Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Company’s business.Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the Company’s ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Company’s deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.The Company’s information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Company’s customer relationships. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently or timely remediated.Information security risks for large financial institutions such as M&T have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies, such as Internet and mobile banking to conduct financial transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, hackers, terrorists, nation-states, activists and other external parties.  There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. There have also been several highly publicized cases where hackers have requested “ransom” payments in exchange for not disclosing customer information. As cyber threats continue to evolve, the Company may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance its layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. The techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently, may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources, including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments. These actors may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers or other users of the Company’s systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or the Company’s systems. These risks may increase as the use of mobile payment and other Internet-based applications expands.The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Company’s systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Company’s reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.Many aspects of the Company’s business involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries’ business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies 37M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Company’s ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure.Third parties provide key components of the Company’s business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Company’s ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Company’s business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Company’s business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 “Business,” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading “Forward-Looking Statements” is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Company’s financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts’ estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies.38"
7,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2016-02-19,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
. M&T and its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. As a financial institution,the Company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and credit risk, among others. Adverse experience with   22 Table of Contentsthese or other risks could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the Companys financial instruments ingeneral, and M&Ts common stock, in particular.  Weakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and mayadversely affect the Company in the future.  Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by theCompany could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the Companys business:    ●  A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company.  ●  A decrease in net interest income derived from the Companys lending and deposit gathering activities.  ●  A decrease in the value of the Companys investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial realestate.  ●  Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Companys investment securities portfolio.  ●  A decrease in fees from the Companys brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices. ●  Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels.  ●  An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill.  ●  An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans orother obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held forsale.   The Companys business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest ratesand movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no controland which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.   As a result of the high percentage of theCompanys assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a materialeffect on the Companys business and profitability and the value of the Companys assets and liabilities. For example:    ●  Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interestthat the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Companys overall net interest income and profitability.  ●  Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, inturn, affect the Companys loss rates on those assets.  ●  Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits.  ●  Such changes can also affect the Companys ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability orprotection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges.  ●  Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reducethe value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Companys results of operations. The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact oninterest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate thenational supply   23 Table of Contentsof bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings andinterest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of the Companys on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserves policies also influence,to a significant extent, the Companys cost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatmentapplied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine thatmanagements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and otherpolicies or the effect that they may have on the Companys business activities, financial condition and results of operations.  TheCompanys business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.  As most of theCompanys assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Companys performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributoryfactor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility also can have some of thefollowing adverse effects on the Company and its business, including adversely affecting the Companys financial condition and results of operations:    ●  It can affect the value or liquidity of the Companys on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.  ●  It can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets.  ●  It can affect M&Ts ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates,could adversely affect the Companys liquidity and results of operations.  ●  It can affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directlyimpacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Companys services.  ●  In general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages. Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has beenand may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.  The Companys regional concentrationsexpose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.  The Companys core banking business islargely concentrated within the Companys retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Connecticut, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, theCompany is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.  Risks Relating to the Regulatory Environment  The Company is subject to extensivegovernment regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the United States, including the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations. The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositorsfunds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect   24 Table of Contentsthe Companys lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations,policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, whichcould have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions withrespect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect the Companys ability to enter into certaintransactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith.  The UnitedStates government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of the regulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. M&T expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible futureinitiatives. M&T also expects more intense scrutiny in the examination process and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likelyincrease the Companys costs, reduce its revenue and may limit its ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.  Not all of the rules required or expected to be implemented under the Dodd-Frank Act have been proposed or adopted, and certain of the rules that have been proposed or adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act aresubject to phase-in or transitional periods. Reforms, both under the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. Although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of theseeffects, M&T believes compliance with new regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limitM&Ts ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the Companys businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affectthe profitability of such businesses. Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the Company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatorypractices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. New capital and liquidity standards adopted by the U.S. banking regulators have resulted in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain moreand higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.  New capital standards, both as a result of theDodd-Frank Act and the new U.S. Basel III-based capital rules have had a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including M&T. The new U.S. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintainsubstantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. For additional information, see Capital Requirements under Part I, Item 1 Business. The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, andgenerally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the Companys business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in M&Tbeing required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capitalrequirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks.  In addition, the new U.S. final Basel III-basedliquidity coverage ratio requirement and the liquidity-related provisions of the Federal Reserves liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements adopted pursuant to Section 165 of Dodd-Frank require the Company to holdincreased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the Companys ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, U.S. federal bankingagencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed   25 Table of Contentsconditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions.  The effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on M&T. Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolutionplan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. M&Ts resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risksarising from its other subsidiaries. The regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plans components, a description of the range ofspecific actions the Company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the Companys organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and management information systems, among other elements. Toaddress effectively any shortcomings in the Companys resolution plan, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC could require the Company to change its business structure or dispose of businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on itsliquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt.  Risks Relating to the CompanysBusiness  Deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company. As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, andthat any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans.  Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estatevaluations, in particular, given the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Companys credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residentialreal estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans tobusinesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performanceassociated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage ofloans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers.  Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as theyare based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses andother occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and generaleconomic conditions affecting consumers.  The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, inmanagements judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associatedwith each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees orindemnifications. The effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on loans acquired at a discount are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. Management believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.However, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. In those cases, the Company may be required to increasethe allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income.   26 Table of ContentsThe Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity. The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well asmeet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits,interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources ofliquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.  The Companys liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits oroutflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms.  Other conditions and factors thatcould materially adversely affect the Companys liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss ofdeposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the Companys creditratings. A downgrade in the Companys credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Companys ability to borrow funds and raise the cost ofborrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&Ts ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors maybe caused by events over which M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future. Recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management have also negatively impacted the Companys results of operationsand competitive position. These regulations address, among other matters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies. If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if theCompany suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise fails to manage liquidity effectively, the Companys liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected. The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Companys revenue andprofitability.  The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only withcommercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. The Company competes on thebasis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become moreconcentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Companys competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as abroader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates ofinterest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with abroader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.   27 Table of ContentsM&T may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to manydifferent industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of thesetransactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated atprices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.  M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are the principal source offunds to pay dividends on M&T stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&Ts banking subsidiaries and certainnonbank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capitalplanning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See Item 1. Business  Dividends for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations.Also, M&Ts right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors. Limitations on M&Ts ability to receivedividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt.  M&Ts ability to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend, in part, on a review of its capital plan by theFederal Reserve.  Federal Reserve capital planning and stress testing rules generally limit a bank holding companys ability to makequarterly capital distributions  that is, dividends and share repurchases  if the amount of actual cumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bank holding company hadindicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. Under these rules, for example, if a bank holding company issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capitalplan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that the dollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued (net distributions), is nogreater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan, as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then currentquarter. As such, M&Ts ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as the amount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock as per its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance withits capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of M&Ts control.  The Company is subject tooperational risk.  Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from humanerror, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules,regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes incircumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Companys ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. In addition, along with   28 Table of Contentsother participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to betterserve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers.Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or otheroperational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Companys reputation or foregone business opportunities.  Changes in accounting standards could impact the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reportingstandards that govern the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Insome cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Companys prior period financial statements.  M&Ts accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the Companys financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates aboutmatters that are uncertain.  Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to the Companys reported financial condition andresults of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&Ts accounting policies are critical because theyrequire management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using differentassumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Companys financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying theCompanys financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.  Management has identifiedcertain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtainedeither when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure thesecritical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of theuncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements if those judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. Foradditional information, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies, of Notesto Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.  Difficulties in combining the operations of acquired entities with the Companys ownoperations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.  M&T has recently expanded its businessthrough acquisition and may do so in the future. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of an acquired entity. M&T may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in anacquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its actual or potential acquisition targets operate are highly competitive. The Company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of  29 Table of Contentsacquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Acquisition and integration activities require M&T to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result M&T may not be able to pursueother business opportunities while integrating acquired entities with the Company.  After completing an acquisition, theCompany may not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, the Company could experience higher credit losses, incur higher operating expenses or realize lessrevenue than originally anticipated related to an acquired entity.  M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilledpersonnel.  M&Ts success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualifiedcandidates in the activities and markets that the Company serves is significant and the Company may not be able to hire candidates and retain them. Growth in the Companys business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need foradditional qualified personnel. If the Company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results ofoperations.  The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that abanking organizations incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, toadopt rules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary tomaintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Companys performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Companys business. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on theCompanys ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Companys deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significantproperty damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties orits investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Companys informationsystems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.  The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems toconduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Companys customer relationships. While the Companyhas policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently ortimely remediated.  There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breachdata security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There have been several instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting unauthorized access to and disclosure of client or customerinformation or the destruction or theft of corporate data, including by executive impersonation and third party vendors. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized untillaunched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, the Company may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of the Companyscustomers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.   30 Table of ContentsThe occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Companyssystems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Companys reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation andfinancial liability.  The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests,investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.  Many aspects of theCompanys business involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries business activities (and insome cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations andproceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank and other regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which couldadversely impact the defense of private litigation. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including for litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, such as in connectionwith the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on theway in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.  Although the Company establishes accruals for legalproceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedingswhere it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedingsin question. Thus, the Companys ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations. M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Companys business infrastructure. Third parties provide key components of the Companys business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections andnetwork access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Companys ability to deliver products and services toclients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Companys business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation ofservices provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions.Failures in the Companys business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report onForm 10-K in Part I, Item 1 Business, and Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the headingForward-Looking Statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Companys financial condition andresults of operations, as well as the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.  In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financialperformance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information,   31 Table of Contentschanges in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies.  "
11,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2015-02-20,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  M&T andits subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and creditrisk, among others. Adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, andM&Ts common stock, in particular.   23 Table of ContentsWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company in the past and may adversely affect theCompany in the future.  Poor business and economic conditions in general or specifically in markets served by the Company could have one ormore of the following adverse effects on the Companys business:    A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company.    A decrease in net interest income derived from the Companys lending and deposit gathering activities.    A decrease in the value of the Companys investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial realestate.    Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Companys investment securities portfolio.    A decrease in fees from the Companys brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices.   Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels.    An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill.    An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans orother obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held forsale.   The Companys business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest ratesand movements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which the Company has no controland which the Company may not be able to anticipate adequately.   As a result of the high percentage of theCompanys assets and liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a materialeffect on the Companys business and profitability and the value of the Companys assets and liabilities. For example:    Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interestthat the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Companys overall net interest income and profitability.    Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, inturn, affect the Companys loss rates on those assets.    Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits.    Such changes can also affect the Companys ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability orprotection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges.    Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reducethe value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Companys results of operations. The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact oninterest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate thenational supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affectthe value of the Companys on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserves policies also influence, to a significant extent, the Companyscost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.Management believes that the assumptions and   24 Table of Contentsjudgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, theresult and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on theCompanys business activities, financial condition and results of operations.  The Companys business and performance isvulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.  As most of the Companys assets and liabilities are financial innature, the Companys performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading tosome of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the Company and itsbusiness, including adversely affecting the Companys financial condition and results of operations:    It can affect the value or liquidity of the Companys on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.    It can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets.    It can affect M&Ts ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates,could adversely affect the Companys liquidity and results of operations.    It can affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directlyimpacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Companys services.    In general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages. Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has beenand may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.  The Companys regional concentrationsexpose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.  The Companys core banking business islargely concentrated within the Companys retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in thefuture may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.  RisksRelating to the Regulatory Environment  The Company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision and thisregulatory environment is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the United States, including the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations.  The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds, federal deposit insurance funds and thefinancial system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Companys lending practices, capital structure, amounts of capital, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, other sanctions by regulatoryagencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bank regulatory agencies, arepursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures and may also adversely affect theCompanys ability to enter into certain transactions or engage in certain activities, or obtain necessary regulatory approvals in connection therewith.   25 Table of ContentsThe United States government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of theregulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. M&T expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. M&T also expects more intense scrutiny in the examinationprocess and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the Companys costs, reduce its revenue and may limit itsability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.  Not all of the rules required or expected to be implemented underthe Dodd-Frank Act have been proposed or adopted, and certain of the rules that have been proposed or adopted under the Dodd-Frank Act are subject to phase-in or transitional periods. Reforms, both under the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise, will have asignificant effect on the entire financial services industry. Although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects, M&T believes compliance with new regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenueand increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit M&Ts ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. Any new regulatory requirements or changes toexisting requirements could require changes to the Companys businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses. Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the Companydeals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, couldhave a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.  New capital and liquiditystandards adopted by the U.S. banking regulators will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. New capital standards, both as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and the new U.S. Basel III-based capital rules will have a significant effect on banks andbank holding companies, including M&T. The new U.S. capital rules require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. For additional information, seeCapital Requirements under Part I, Item 1 Business.  The need to maintain more and higher qualitycapital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the Companys business activities, including lending, and itsability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwisereturn capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks.  In addition, the new U.S. final Basel III-based liquidity coverage ratio requirement that will come into effect, subject to certain phase-in requirements, in 2016 and the liquidity-related provisions ofthe Federal Reserves liquidity-related enhanced prudential supervision requirements adopted pursuant to Section 165 of Dodd-Frank will require the Company to hold increased levels of unencumbered highly liquid investments, therebyreducing the Companys ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal bankingagencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, sharerepurchases and acquisitions.  The effect of resolution plan requirements may have a material adverse impact on M&T. Bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as M&T, are required to report periodically to regulators a resolutionplan for their rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure. M&Ts resolution plan must, among other things, ensure that its depository institution subsidiaries are adequately protected from risksarising from its other subsidiaries. The regulation adopted by the Federal Reserve and FDIC sets specific standards for the resolution plans, including requiring a strategic analysis of the plans components, a description of the range ofspecific   26 Table of Contentsactions the Company proposes to take in resolution, and a description of the Companys organizational structure, material entities, interconnections and interdependencies, and managementinformation systems, among other elements. To address effectively any shortcomings in the Companys resolution plan, the Federal Reserve and the FDIC could require the Company to change its business structure or dispose of businesses, whichcould have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. Risks Relating to the Companys Business  Deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.  As a lender, the Companyis exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may be insufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in thebusiness of making loans.  Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditionsaffecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Companys credit lossexperience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans inthe Companys loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced lesseconomic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Companys portfolio of loansto individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers.  Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes inbusiness climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, theavailability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers.  The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in managements judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined bymanagements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowersoperate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. The effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on acquired loans are also consideredin the establishment of the allowance for credit losses.  Management believes that the allowance for credit lossesappropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economyexperiences a downturn. In those cases, the Company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income.  The Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.  The Company mustmaintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source offunding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historicallyprovided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and theFederal Reserve Bank of New York.  The Companys liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materiallyadversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and   27 Table of Contentsvolatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to accesscapital markets on favorable terms.  Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect the Companysliquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access thecapital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the Companys credit ratings. A downgrade in the Companys credit ratings,which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Companys ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantially and could cause creditors andbusiness counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&Ts ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over which M&T has little or nocontrol. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.  Recent regulatory changes relating to liquidity and risk management may also negatively impact the Companys results of operations and competitive position. These regulations address, among othermatters, liquidity stress testing, minimum liquidity requirements and restrictions on short-term debt issued by top-tier holding companies.  If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise failsto manage liquidity effectively, the Companys liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.  The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Companys revenue and profitability. The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks andthrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. The Company competes on the basis of several factors,including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutionsinvolved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Companys competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products andservices and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally,technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitorsincluding many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.  M&T may be adversely affected bythe soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers anddealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Companys credit risk may be exacerbated when thecollateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on theCompanys financial condition and results of operations.  M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue fromsubsidiary dividends. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on   28 Table of ContentsM&T stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&Tsbanking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatoryfocus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See Item 1. Business  Dividends for a discussion of regulatory and otherrestrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&Ts right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors. Limitations onM&Ts ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. M&Ts ability to pay dividends on common stock may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of its control and will depend,in part, on a review of its capital plan by the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve recently amended its capital planning and stresstesting rules to, among other things, generally limit a bank holding companys ability to make quarterly capital distributions  that is, dividends and share repurchases  commencing April 1, 2015 if the amount of actualcumulative quarterly capital issuances of instruments that qualify as regulatory capital are less than the bank holding company had indicated in its submitted capital plan as to which it received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve. Under thesenew rules, for example, if a bank holding company issued a smaller amount of additional common stock than it had stated in its capital plan, it would be required to reduce common dividends and/or the amount of common stock repurchases so that thedollar amount of capital distributions, net of the dollar amount of additional common stock issued (net distributions), is no greater than the dollar amount of net distributions relating to its common stock included in its capital plan,as measured on an aggregate basis beginning in the third quarter of the nine-quarter planning horizon through the end of the then current quarter. As such, M&Ts ability to declare and pay dividends on its common stock, as well as theamount of such dividends, will depend, in part, on its ability to issue stock as per its capital plan or to otherwise remain in compliance with its capital plan, which may be adversely affected by market and other factors outside of M&Tscontrol.  The Company is subject to operational risk.  Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events.Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk ofnoncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on theCompanys ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. In addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven productsand services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain competitive or be successfulin marketing these products and services to its customers. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls that are reviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, isinfallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Companys reputation or foregone business opportunities. Changes in accounting standards could impact the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodicallychange the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports itsfinancial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Companys prior period financial statements.   29 Table of ContentsM&Ts accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the Companysfinancial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.  Accountingpolicies and processes are fundamental to the Companys reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities andfinancial results. Several of M&Ts accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materiallydifferent amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing theCompanys financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Companys financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.  Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. Avariety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailedpolicies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changingmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements ifthose judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Note1, Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.  Difficulties in combining theoperations of acquired entities with the Companys own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.  M&T has regularly considered opportunities to expand and improve its business through acquisition of other financial institutions. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of anacquired entity. M&T may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its potential acquisition targets operate arehighly competitive. The Company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Future acquisition and integration activities may require M&T to devote substantial time and resources, and asa result M&T may not be able to pursue other business opportunities.  After completing an acquisition, the Company may notrealize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, the Company could experience higher credit losses than originally anticipated related to an acquired loan portfolio. M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.  M&Ts success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the Company serves issignificant and the Company may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. Growth in the Companys business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. If the Company is not able to hireor retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a bankingorganizations incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adoptrules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary tomaintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Companys performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected.   30 Table of ContentsSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantlyimpact the Companys business.  Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events couldhave a significant impact on the Companys ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Companys deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateralsecuring loans, cause significant property damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significantenvironmental effects on its properties or its investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Companys information systems may experience interruptions or breaches in security. The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of thesesystems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Companys customer relationships. While the Company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of thesepossible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficiently remediated.  There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties, including through cyber attacks, to breach data security at financial institutions or with respect to financial transactions. There havebeen several recent instances involving financial services and consumer-based companies reporting the unauthorized disclosure of client or customer information or the destruction or theft of corporate data. In addition, because the techniques usedto cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, the Company may be unable to proactively address these techniques orto implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of the Companys customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requires secure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data securitybreaches.  The occurrence of any failure, interruption or security breach of the Companys systems, particularly ifwidespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Companys reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability. The Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations andproceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.  Many aspects of the Companysbusiness involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arising from its or its subsidiaries business activities (and in some cases fromthe activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agency information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and otherforms of regulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. The SEC has announced a policy of seeking admissions of liability in certain settled cases, which could adversely impact the defense ofprivate litigation. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the purchase orsale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which theCompany conducts its business, or reputational harm.  Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings wheninformation related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces arisk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus,the Companys ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations.   31 Table of ContentsM&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Companys businessinfrastructure.  Third parties provide key components of the Companys business infrastructure such as banking services, processing,and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Companys ability todeliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Companys business to the extent those difficulties result in theinterruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from systemfailures or other disruptions. Failures in the Companys business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.  Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 Business, andPart II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading Forward-Looking Statements is included adescription of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of theCompanys financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.  In addition, the market price ofM&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneousinformation, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies.  "
17,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2014-02-21,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  M&T andits subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and creditrisk, among others. Adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, andM&Ts common stock, in particular.   24 Table of ContentsWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company and may adversely affect the Company in thefuture.  From late-2007 through mid-2009, the U.S. economy was in recession. Although there has been gradual improvement in the U.S.economy since then, economic growth has been uneven and unemployment levels are high. A slowing of improvement or a return to deteriorating business and economic conditions could have one or more of the following adverse effects on theCompanys business:    A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company.    A decrease in net interest income derived from the Companys lending and deposit gathering activities.    A decrease in the value of the Companys investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial realestate.    Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Companys investment securities portfolio.    A decrease in fees from the Companys brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices.   Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels.    An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill.    An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans orother obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held forsale.  The Companys business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates andmovements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which M&T has no control and whichM&T may not be able to anticipate adequately.   As a result of the high percentage of the Companys assetsand liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on theCompanys business and profitability and the value of the Companys assets and liabilities. For example:    Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interestthat the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Companys overall net interest income and profitability.    Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, inturn, affect the Companys loss rates on those assets.    Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits.    Such changes can also affect the Companys ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability orprotection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges.    Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reducethe value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Companys results of operations. The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact oninterest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate thenational supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affectthe value of the Companys on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserves policies also influence, to a significant extent, the Companyscost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from   25 Table of Contentsvarious governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions. Management believes that theassumptions and judgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, the result and adjustments required couldhave a material effect on the Companys results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on the Companys business activities,financial condition and results of operations.  The Companys business and performance is vulnerable to the impact of volatility indebt and equity markets.  As most of the Companys assets and liabilities are financial in nature, the Companys performancetends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets can be a major contributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein,including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility also can have some of the following adverse effects on the Company and its business, including adversely affectingthe Companys financial condition and results of operations:    It can affect the value or liquidity of the Companys on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.    It can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets.    It can affect M&Ts ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates,could adversely affect the Companys liquidity and results of operations.    It can affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directlyimpacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Companys services.    In general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages. Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has beenand may continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.  The Companys regional concentrationsexpose it to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.  Although many of the Companys businessesare national in scope, its core banking business is concentrated within the Companys retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District ofColumbia. Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.  Risks Relating to the Regulatory Environment  The Company is subject to extensivegovernment regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the United States, including the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations. The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositorsfunds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations and supervisory guidance affect the Companys lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy andgrowth, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations, policies or supervisory guidance could result in civil or criminal penalties, including monetary penalties, the loss of FDIC insurance, the revocation of a banking charter, othersanctions by regulatory agencies, and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. In this regard, government authorities, including the bankregulatory agencies, are pursuing aggressive enforcement actions with respect to compliance and other legal matters involving financial activities, which heightens the risks associated with actual and perceived compliance failures.   26 Table of ContentsThe United States government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of theregulatory oversight structure of the financial services industry. M&T expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. M&T also expects more intense scrutiny in the examinationprocess and more aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the Companys costs, reduce its revenue and may limit itsability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities.  Many parts of the Dodd-Frank Act are now in effect, while othersdepend on rules that have yet to be adopted or implemented. Reforms, both under the Dodd-Frank Act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. Although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extentof these effects, M&T believes compliance with new regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limitM&Ts ability to pursue certain desirable business opportunities. Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the Companys businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affectthe profitability of such businesses. Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the Company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatorypractices, requirements or expectations could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations. New capital and liquidity standards adopted by the U.S. banking regulators will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain moreand higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case.  New and evolving capital standards, both as a resultof the Dodd-Frank Act and implementation in the U.S. of new capital standards adopted by the Basel Committee, including the so-called Basel III capital accord, will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, includingM&T. Basel III, when implemented and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. For additional information, see CapitalRequirements under Part I, Item 1 Business.  The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, aswell as greater liquidity, going forward than historically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the Companys business activities, including lending, and its ability toexpand, either organically or through acquisitions. It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise returncapital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiring assets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks. In addition, new liquidity standards will require the Company to increase its holdings ofunencumbered highly liquid investments, thereby reducing the Companys ability to invest in other longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are beingphased in over time, U.S. federal banking agencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital,such as dividend increases, share repurchases and acquisitions.  Risks Relating to the Companys Business Deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.  As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may beinsufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans.  Factors that influence theCompanys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Companys real estate loanportfolios. Factors that can influence the Companys credit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential realestate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City  27 Table of Contentsmetropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performanceassociated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage ofloans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers.  Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as theyare based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses andother occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends, the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and generaleconomic conditions affecting consumers.  The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, inmanagements judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined by managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associatedwith each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowers operate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees orindemnifications. The effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on acquired loans are also considered in the establishment of the allowance for credit losses. M&T believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriately reflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.However, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences a downturn. In those cases, the Company may be required to increasethe allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income.  The Company must maintain adequatesources of funding and liquidity.  The Company must maintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support itsoperations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source of funding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customerdeposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historically provided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-costfunds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Companys liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materially adversely affected by a variety of conditionsand factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer deposits or outflows of cash or collateral and/orability to access capital markets on favorable terms.  Other conditions and factors that could materially adversely affect theCompanys liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss of deposits and/or negatively affect theability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the Companys credit ratings. A downgrade in theCompanys credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Companys ability to borrow funds and raise the cost of borrowings substantiallyand could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise collateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&Ts ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events overwhich M&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.  If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise failsto manage liquidity effectively, the Companys liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.   28 Table of ContentsThe financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that couldadversely affect the Companys revenue and profitability.  The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highlycompetitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks and thrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globallyand over the Internet. The Company competes on the basis of several factors, including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of thefinancial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutions involved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Companys competitors gaininggreater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share byreducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally, technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result thatthe Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitors including many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.  M&T may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to manydifferent industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers and dealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of thesetransactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Companys credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated atprices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition and results of operations. M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity.  M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue from subsidiary dividends. These dividends are the principal source offunds to pay dividends on M&T stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amount of dividends that M&Ts banking subsidiaries and certainnonbank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased in recent years and has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capitalplanning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks, such as parent bank holding companies. See Item 1. Business  Dividends for a discussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations.Also, M&Ts right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of that subsidiarys creditors. Limitations on M&Ts ability to receivedividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt.  The Company is subject to operational risk.  Like all businesses, the Company is subject tooperational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events. Operational risk also encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is therisk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethical standards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational riskthrough outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcing vendors can have on the Companys ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. In addition,along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company continually and frequently attempts to introduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reducecosts. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allows it to remain   29 Table of Contentscompetitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls which arereviewed and updated, no system of controls, however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Companys reputationor foregone business opportunities.  Changes in accounting standards could impact the Companys financial condition and results ofoperations.  The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and otherregulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how theCompany records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Companys prior periodfinancial statements.  M&Ts accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the Companys financialcondition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.  Accounting policies andprocesses are fundamental to the Companys reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financialresults. Several of M&Ts accounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially differentamounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing theCompanys financial statements. If assumptions or estimates underlying the Companys financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.  Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. Avariety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailedpolicies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changingmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements ifthose judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Note1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.  Difficulties incombining the operations of acquired entities with the Companys own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.  M&T has regularly considered opportunities to expand and improve its business through acquisition of other financial institutions. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of anacquired entity. M&T may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its potential acquisition targets operate arehighly competitive. The Company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of acquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Future acquisition and integration activities may require M&T to devote substantial time and resources, and asa result M&T may not be able to pursue other business opportunities.  After completing an acquisition, the Company may notrealize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, the Company could experience higher credit losses than originally anticipated related to an acquired loan portfolio.  30 Table of ContentsM&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel. M&Ts success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in theactivities and markets that the Company serves is significant and the Company may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. Growth in the Companys business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additionalqualified personnel. If the Company is not able to hire or retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. The federal banking agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a bankingorganizations incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act required those agencies, along with the SEC, to adoptrules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with such rules M&T is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintainits competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Companys performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Companys business. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on theCompanys ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Companys deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significantproperty damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties orits investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Companys informationsystems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.  The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems toconduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Companys customer relationships. While the Companyhas policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficientlyremediated.  There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutionsor with respect to financial transactions. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areasaround the world, the Company may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of the Companys customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requiressecure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.  The occurrence of anyfailure, interruption or security breach of the Companys systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Companys reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it toadditional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.  The Company is or may become involved from timeto time in suits, legal proceedings, information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.  Many aspects of the Companys business involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arisingfrom its or its subsidiaries business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agencyinformation-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of   31 Table of Contentsregulatory inquiry, including by bank regulatory agencies, the SEC and law enforcement authorities. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related to legalproceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant civil or criminalpenalties, including monetary penalties, damages, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm. Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by thosematters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of theassessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Companys ultimate losses may be higher, and possiblysignificantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies, which could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  M&T relies on other companies to provide key components of the Companys business infrastructure.  Third parties provide key components of the Companys business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such servicesprovided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes of use could adversely affect the Companys ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business.Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affect the Companys business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. TheCompany may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures and insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Companys businessinfrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.  Detailed discussions of the specificrisks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report on Form 10-K in Part I, Item 1 Business, and Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of Operations. Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading Forward-Looking Statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified bymanagement that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, inparticular.  In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of otherfactors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accountingpolicies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatory agencies.   "
16,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2013-02-25,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  M&T andits subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and creditrisk, among others. Adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, andM&Ts common stock, in particular.   25 Table of ContentsWeakness in the economy has adversely affected the Company and may continue to adversely affect theCompany.  From late-2007 through mid-2009, the U.S. economy was in recession. Although there has been gradual improvement in the U.S.economy since then, economic growth has been slow and uneven. The housing market remains weak and unemployment levels are high. Local governments and some businesses are in financial difficulty due to lower consumer spending and the lack ofliquidity in the credit markets. A slowing of improvement or a return to deteriorating business and economic conditions could have one or more of the following adverse effects on the Companys business:    A decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by the Company.    A decrease in net interest income derived from the Companys lending and deposit gathering activities.    A decrease in the value of the Companys investment securities, loans held for sale or other assets secured by residential or commercial realestate.    Other-than-temporary impairment of investment securities in the Companys investment securities portfolio.    A decrease in fees from the Companys brokerage and trust businesses associated with declines or lack of growth in stock market prices.   Potential higher FDIC assessments due to the DIF falling below minimum required levels.    An impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill.    An increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans orother obligations to the Company. An increase in the number of delinquencies, bankruptcies or defaults could result in higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs, provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held forsale.  The Companys business and financial performance is impacted significantly by market interest rates andmovements in those rates. The monetary, tax and other policies of governmental agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact on interest rates and overall financial market performance over which M&T has no control and whichM&T may not be able to anticipate adequately.   As a result of the high percentage of the Companys assetsand liabilities that are in the form of interest-bearing or interest-related instruments, changes in interest rates, in the shape of the yield curve or in spreads between different market interest rates, can have a material effect on theCompanys business and profitability and the value of the Companys assets and liabilities. For example:    Changes in interest rates or interest rate spreads can affect the difference between the interest that the Company earns on assets and the interestthat the Company pays on liabilities, which impacts the Companys overall net interest income and profitability.    Such changes can affect the ability of borrowers to meet obligations under variable or adjustable rate loans and other debt instruments, and can, inturn, affect the Companys loss rates on those assets.    Such changes may decrease the demand for interest rate based products and services, including loans and deposits.    Such changes can also affect the Companys ability to hedge various forms of market and interest rate risk and may decrease the profitability orprotection or increase the risk or cost associated with such hedges.    Movements in interest rates also affect mortgage prepayment speeds and could result in the impairment of capitalized mortgage servicing assets, reducethe value of loans held for sale and increase the volatility of mortgage banking revenues, potentially adversely affecting the Companys results of operations. The monetary, tax and other policies of the government and its agencies, including the Federal Reserve, have a significant impact oninterest rates and overall financial market performance. These governmental policies can thus affect the activities and results of operations of banking companies such as the Company. An important function of the Federal Reserve is to regulate thenational supply of bank credit and certain interest rates. The actions of the Federal Reserve influence the rates of interest that the Company charges on loans and that the Company pays on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affectthe value of the Companys on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments. Also, due to the impact on rates for short-term funding, the Federal Reserves policies also influence, to a significant extent, the Companyscost of such funding. In addition, the Company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities. Such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the Company to specific transactions.Management believes that the assumptions and   26 Table of Contentsjudgment used to record tax-related assets or liabilities have been appropriate. Should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were inappropriate, theresult and adjustments required could have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. M&T cannot predict the nature or timing of future changes in monetary, tax and other policies or the effect that they may have on theCompanys business activities, financial condition and results of operations.  The Companys business and performance isvulnerable to the impact of volatility in debt and equity markets.  As most of the Companys assets and liabilities are financial innature, the Companys performance tends to be sensitive to the performance of the financial markets. Turmoil and volatility in U.S. and global financial markets, such as that experienced during the recent financial crisis, can be a majorcontributory factor to overall weak economic conditions, leading to some of the risks discussed herein, including the impaired ability of borrowers and other counterparties to meet obligations to the Company. Financial market volatility also canhave some of the following adverse effects on the Company and its business, including adversely affecting the Companys financial condition and results of operations:    It can affect the value or liquidity of the Companys on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments.    It can affect the value of capitalized servicing assets.    It can affect M&Ts ability to access capital markets to raise funds. Inability to access capital markets if needed, at cost effective rates,could adversely affect the Companys liquidity and results of operations.    It can affect the value of the assets that the Company manages or otherwise administers or services for others. Although the Company is not directlyimpacted by changes in the value of such assets, decreases in the value of those assets would affect related fee income and could result in decreased demand for the Companys services.    In general, it can impact the nature, profitability or risk profile of the financial transactions in which the Company engages. Volatility in the markets for real estate and other assets commonly securing financial products has been andmay continue to be a significant contributor to overall volatility in financial markets.  The Companys regional concentrations exposeit to adverse economic conditions in its primary retail banking office footprint.  Although many of the Companys businesses arenational in scope, its core banking business is concentrated within the Companys retail banking office network footprint, located principally in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.Therefore, the Company is, or in the future may be, particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions.  Risks Relating to the Regulatory Environment  The Company is subject to extensivegovernment regulation and supervision and this regulatory environment is being significantly impacted by the financial regulatory reform initiatives in the United States, including the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulations. The Company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositorsfunds, federal deposit insurance funds and the financial system as a whole, not security holders. These regulations affect the Companys lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things.Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, which could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition andresults of operations.  The United States government and others have recently undertaken major reforms of the regulatoryoversight structure of the financial services industry. M&T expects to face increased regulation of its industry as a result of current and possible future initiatives. M&T also expects more intense scrutiny in the examination process andmore aggressive enforcement of regulations on both the federal and state levels. Compliance with these new regulations and supervisory initiatives will likely increase the Companys costs, reduce its revenue and may limit its ability to pursuecertain desirable business opportunities.   27 Table of ContentsMany parts of the Dodd-Frank Act are now in effect, while others depend on rules that are inan implementation stage likely to continue for several years. The law requires that regulators, some of which are new regulatory bodies created by the Dodd-Frank Act, draft, review and approve hundreds of implementing regulations and conductnumerous studies that are likely to lead to more regulations. As such, the ultimate impact of the Dodd-Frank Act on the Company currently cannot be fully predicted. For more information about the Dodd-Frank Act, see Recent Developmentsunder Part I, Item I Business and Recent Legislative Developments under Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Reforms, both under theDodd-Frank Act and otherwise, will have a significant effect on the entire financial services industry. Although it is difficult to predict the magnitude and extent of these effects, M&T believes compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and itsimplementing regulations and other initiatives will likely negatively impact revenue and increase the cost of doing business, both in terms of transition expenses and on an ongoing basis, and may also limit M&Ts ability to pursue certaindesirable business opportunities. Any new regulatory requirements or changes to existing requirements could require changes to the Companys businesses, result in increased compliance costs and affect the profitability of such businesses.Additionally, reform could affect the behaviors of third parties that the Company deals with in the course of its business, such as rating agencies, insurance companies and investors. Heightened regulatory practices, requirements or expectationsresulting from the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules promulgated thereunder could affect the Company in substantial and unpredictable ways, and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Companys business, financial condition and resultsof operations.  Capital requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act, together with new capital and liquidity standards developed through theBasel Committee and adopted by the U.S. banking regulators, will result in banks and bank holding companies needing to maintain more and higher quality capital and greater liquidity than has historically been the case. New and evolving capital standards, both as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and implementation in the U.S. of new capital standards adopted by the BaselCommittee, including the so-called Basel III capital accord, will have a significant effect on banks and bank holding companies, including M&T. Basel III, when implemented by the U.S. bank regulatory agencies as proposed in a jointnotice of proposed rulemaking in June 2012 and fully phased-in, will require bank holding companies and their bank subsidiaries to maintain substantially more capital, with a greater emphasis on common equity. For additional information, seeCapital Requirements under Part I, Item 1 Business. Because implementation of the new Basel III capital and liquidity standards in the U.S., as well as any additional heightened capital or liquidity standards that may beestablished by the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act, remain subject to rulemaking in the U.S. and, in many cases, to extended observation and phase-in periods, the full effect of these standards on M&Ts regulatory capital isuncertain at this time.  The need to maintain more and higher quality capital, as well as greater liquidity, going forward thanhistorically has been required, and generally increased regulatory scrutiny with respect to capital levels, could limit the Companys business activities, including lending, and its ability to expand, either organically or through acquisitions.It could also result in M&T being required to take steps to increase its regulatory capital that may be dilutive to shareholders or limit its ability to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders, or sell or refrain from acquiringassets, the capital requirements for which are not justified by the assets underlying risks. In addition, the new liquidity standards could require the Company to increase its holdings of unencumbered highly liquid short-term investments,thereby reducing the Companys ability to invest in longer-term assets even if deemed more desirable from a balance sheet management perspective. Moreover, although these new requirements are being phased in over time, U.S. federal bankingagencies have been taking into account expectations regarding the ability of banks to meet these new requirements, including under stressed conditions, in approving actions that represent uses of capital, such as dividend increases, sharerepurchases and acquisitions.  Risks Relating to the Companys Business Deteriorating credit quality could adversely impact the Company.  As a lender, the Company is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans in accordance with the terms of the agreements, and that any collateral securing the loans may beinsufficient to assure full repayment. Credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans.   28 Table of ContentsFactors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overall economicconditions affecting businesses and consumers, generally, but also residential and commercial real estate valuations, in particular, given the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolios. Factors that can influence the Companyscredit loss experience include: (i) the impact of residential real estate values on loans to residential real estate builders and developers and other loans secured by residential real estate; (ii) the concentrations of commercial realestate loans in the Companys loan portfolio; (iii) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historicallyexperienced less economic growth and vitality than many other regions of the country; (iv) the repayment performance associated with first and second lien loans secured by residential real estate; and (v) the size of the Companysportfolio of loans to individual consumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than loans to other types of borrowers. In recent years, the Company has experienced historically high levelsof nonaccrual loans and net charge-offs of residential real estate-related loans, including first and junior lien mortgage loans and loans to builders and developers of residential real estate. The Company has also experienced higher than historicallevels of nonaccrual commercial real estate loans since 2009. Commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective, as they are based upon many assumptions. Such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time bychanges in business climate, economic conditions, interest rates and, in many cases, the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property. Similarly, residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends,the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates, governmental policy regarding housing and housing finance and general economic conditions affecting consumers.  The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents, in managements judgment, the amount of losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. The allowance is determined bymanagements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio based on such factors as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category, the current financial condition of specific borrowers, the economic environment in which borrowersoperate, the level of delinquent loans, the value of any collateral and, where applicable, the existence of any guarantees or indemnifications. The effects of probable decreases in expected principal cash flows on acquired loans are also consideredin the establishment of the allowance for credit losses.  M&T believes that the allowance for credit losses appropriatelyreflects credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. However, there is no assurance that the allowance will be sufficient to cover such credit losses, particularly if housing and employment conditions worsen or the economy experiences adownturn. In those cases, the Company may be required to increase the allowance through an increase in the provision for credit losses, which would reduce net income.  The Company must maintain adequate sources of funding and liquidity.  The Company mustmaintain adequate funding sources in the normal course of business to support its operations and fund outstanding liabilities, as well as meet regulatory expectations. The Company primarily relies on deposits to be a low cost and stable source offunding for the loans it makes and the operations of its business. Core customer deposits, which include noninterest-bearing deposits, interest-bearing transaction accounts, savings deposits and time deposits of $250,000 or less, have historicallyprovided the Company with a sizeable source of relatively stable and low-cost funds. In addition to customer deposits, sources of liquidity include borrowings from third party banks, securities dealers, various Federal Home Loan Banks and theFederal Reserve Bank of New York.  The Companys liquidity and ability to fund and run the business could be materiallyadversely affected by a variety of conditions and factors, including financial and credit market disruptions and volatility or a lack of market or customer confidence in financial markets in general, which may result in a loss of customer depositsor outflows of cash or collateral and/or ability to access capital markets on favorable terms.  Other conditions and factorsthat could materially adversely affect the Companys liquidity and funding include a lack of market or customer confidence in, or negative news about, the Company or the financial services industry generally which also may result in a loss ofdeposits and/or negatively affect the ability to access the capital markets; the loss of customer deposits to alternative investments; inability to sell or securitize loans or other assets; and downgrades in one or more of the Companys creditratings. A downgrade in the Companys credit ratings, which could result from general industry-wide or regulatory factors not solely related to the Company, could adversely affect the Companys ability to borrow funds and raise the cost ofborrowings substantially and could cause creditors and business counterparties to raise   29 Table of Contentscollateral requirements or take other actions that could adversely affect M&Ts ability to raise capital. Many of the above conditions and factors may be caused by events over whichM&T has little or no control. There can be no assurance that significant disruption and volatility in the financial markets will not occur in the future.  If the Company is unable to continue to fund assets through customer bank deposits or access funding sources on favorable terms or if the Company suffers an increase in borrowing costs or otherwise failsto manage liquidity effectively, the Companys liquidity, operating margins, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.  The financial services industry is highly competitive and creates competitive pressures that could adversely affect the Companys revenue and profitability. The financial services industry in which the Company operates is highly competitive. The Company competes not only with commercial and other banks andthrifts, but also with insurance companies, mutual funds, hedge funds, securities brokerage firms and other companies offering financial services in the U.S., globally and over the Internet. The Company competes on the basis of several factors,including capital, access to capital, revenue generation, products, services, transaction execution, innovation, reputation and price. Over time, certain sectors of the financial services industry have become more concentrated, as institutionsinvolved in a broad range of financial services have been acquired by or merged into other firms. These developments could result in the Companys competitors gaining greater capital and other resources, such as a broader range of products andservices and geographic diversity. The Company may experience pricing pressures as a result of these factors and as some of its competitors seek to increase market share by reducing prices or paying higher rates of interest on deposits. Finally,technological change is influencing how individuals and firms conduct their financial affairs and changing the delivery channels for financial services, with the result that the Company may have to contend with a broader range of competitorsincluding many that are not located within the geographic footprint of its banking office network.  M&T may be adversely affected bythe soundness of other financial institutions.  Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing,counterparty, or other relationships. The Company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including commercial banks, brokers anddealers, investment banks, and other institutional clients. Many of these transactions expose the Company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client. In addition, the Companys credit risk may be exacerbated when thecollateral held by the Company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the Company. Any such losses could have a material adverse effect on theCompanys financial condition and results of operations.  M&T relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for its liquidity. M&T is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries. M&T typically receives substantially all of its revenue fromsubsidiary dividends. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on M&T stock and interest and principal on its debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations, as well as regulatory expectations, limit the amountof dividends that M&Ts banking subsidiaries and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay. Regulatory scrutiny of capital levels at bank holding companies and insured depository institution subsidiaries has increased since the financial crisisand has resulted in increased regulatory focus on all aspects of capital planning, including dividends and other distributions to shareholders of banks such as parent bank holding companies. See Item 1. Business  Dividends for adiscussion of regulatory and other restrictions on dividend declarations. Also, M&Ts right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of thatsubsidiarys creditors. Limitations on M&Ts ability to receive dividends from its subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on its liquidity and ability to pay dividends on its stock or interest and principal on its debt. The Company is subject to operational risk.  Like all businesses, the Company is subject to operational risk, which represents the risk of loss resulting from human error, inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, and external events.Operational risk   30 Table of Contentsalso encompasses reputational risk and compliance and legal risk, which is the risk of loss from violations of, or noncompliance with, laws, rules, regulations, prescribed practices or ethicalstandards, as well as the risk of noncompliance with contractual and other obligations. The Company is also exposed to operational risk through outsourcing arrangements, and the effect that changes in circumstances or capabilities of its outsourcingvendors can have on the Companys ability to continue to perform operational functions necessary to its business. In addition, along with other participants in the financial services industry, the Company continually and frequently attempts tointroduce new technology-driven products and services that are aimed at allowing the Company to better serve customers and to reduce costs. The Company may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services that allowsit to remain competitive or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Although the Company seeks to mitigate operational risk through a system of internal controls which are reviewed and updated, no system of controls,however well designed and maintained, is infallible. Control weaknesses or failures or other operational risks could result in charges, increased operational costs, harm to the Companys reputation or foregone business opportunities. Changes in accounting standards could impact the Companys financial condition and results of operations. The accounting standard setters, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodicallychange the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how the Company records and reports itsfinancial condition and results of operations. In some cases, the Company could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, which would result in the restating of the Companys prior period financial statements. M&Ts accounting policies and processes are critical to the reporting of the Companys financial condition and results of operations.They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.  Accounting policies and processes are fundamental to theCompanys reported financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies require use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of assets or liabilities and financial results. Several of M&Tsaccounting policies are critical because they require management to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported underdifferent conditions or using different assumptions. Pursuant to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), management is required to make certain assumptions and estimates in preparing the Companys financial statements. Ifassumptions or estimates underlying the Companys financial statements are incorrect, the Company may experience material losses.  Management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require managements judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. Avariety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or recognizing or reducing a liability. M&T has established detailedpolicies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changingmethodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, M&T could be required to adjust accounting policies or restate prior period financial statements ifthose judgments and estimates prove to be incorrect. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Critical Accounting Estimates and Note1, Significant Accounting Policies, to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8.  Difficulties in combining theoperations of acquired entities with the Companys own operations may prevent M&T from achieving the expected benefits from its acquisitions.  M&T has regularly considered opportunities to expand and improve its business through acquisition of other financial institutions. Inherent uncertainties exist when integrating the operations of anacquired entity. M&T may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies in an acquisition. In addition, the markets and industries in which the Company and its potential acquisition targets operate arehighly competitive. The Company may lose customers or fail to retain the customers of   31 Table of Contentsacquired entities as a result of an acquisition. Future acquisition and integration activities may require M&T to devote substantial time and resources, and as a result M&T may not beable to pursue other business opportunities.  After completing an acquisition, the Company may not realize the expectedbenefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity. For example, the Company could experience higher credit losses than originally anticipated related to an acquired loan portfolio. M&T could suffer if it fails to attract and retain skilled personnel.  M&Ts success depends, in large part, on its ability to attract and retain key individuals. Competition for qualified candidates in the activities and markets that the Company serves issignificant and the Company may not be able to hire these candidates and retain them. Growth in the Companys business, including through acquisitions, may increase its need for additional qualified personnel. If the Company is not able to hireor retain these key individuals, it may be unable to execute its business strategies and may suffer adverse consequences to its business, financial condition and results of operations. In June 2010, the federal banking agencies issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to help ensure that a bankingorganizations incentive compensation policies do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act requires those agencies, along with the SEC, to adoptrules to require reporting of incentive compensation and to prohibit certain compensation arrangements. If as a result of complying with any such rules M&T is unable to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary tomaintain its competitive position, or if the compensation costs required to attract and retain employees become more significant, the Companys performance, including its competitive position, could be materially adversely affected. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the Companys business. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on theCompanys ability to conduct business. Such events could affect the stability of the Companys deposit base, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, cause significantproperty damage, result in loss of revenue and/or cause the Company to incur additional expenses. Although the Company has established disaster recovery plans and procedures, and monitors for significant environmental effects on its properties orits investments, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Companys informationsystems may experience interruptions or breaches in security.  The Company relies heavily on communications and information systems toconduct its business. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in disruptions to its accounting, deposit, loan and other systems, and adversely affect the Companys customer relationships. While the Companyhas policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of these possible events, there can be no assurance that any such failure, interruption or security breach will not occur or, if any does occur, that it can be sufficientlyremediated.  There have been increasing efforts on the part of third parties to breach data security at financial institutionsor with respect to financial transactions. In addition, because the techniques used to cause such security breaches change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target and may originate from less regulated and remote areasaround the world, the Company may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. The ability of the Companys customers to bank remotely, including online and through mobile devices, requiressecure transmission of confidential information and increases the risk of data security breaches.  The occurrence of anyfailure, interruption or security breach of the Companys systems, particularly if widespread or resulting in financial losses to customers, could damage the Companys reputation, result in a loss of customer business, subject it toadditional regulatory scrutiny, or expose it to civil litigation and financial liability.   32 Table of ContentsThe Company is or may become involved from time to time in suits, legal proceedings,information-gathering requests, investigations and proceedings by governmental and self-regulatory agencies that may lead to adverse consequences.  Many aspects of the Companys business involve substantial risk of legal liability. M&T and/or its subsidiaries have been named or threatened to be named as defendants in various lawsuits arisingfrom its or its subsidiaries business activities (and in some cases from the activities of companies M&T has acquired). In addition, from time to time, M&T is, or may become, the subject of governmental and self-regulatory agencyinformation-gathering requests, reviews, investigations and proceedings and other forms of regulatory inquiry, including by the SEC and law enforcement authorities. M&T is also at risk when it has agreed to indemnify others for losses related tolegal proceedings, including litigation and governmental investigations and inquiries, they face, such as in connection with the purchase or sale of a business or assets. The results of such proceedings could lead to significant monetary damages orpenalties, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restrictions on the way in which the Company conducts its business, or reputational harm.  Although the Company establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amountof loss can be reasonably estimated, the Company does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss. In addition, due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legalproceedings, amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to the Company from the legal proceedings in question. Thus, the Companys ultimate losses may be higher, and possibly significantly so, than the amounts accrued for legal losscontingencies, which could adversely affect the Companys financial condition and results of operations.  M&T relies on othercompanies to provide key components of the Companys business infrastructure.  Third parties provide key components of theCompanys business infrastructure such as banking services, processing, and Internet connections and network access. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current orhigher volumes of use could adversely affect the Companys ability to deliver products and services to clients and otherwise to conduct business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third party service provider could adversely affectthe Companys business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. The Company may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third party failures andinsurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in the Companys business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business. Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report onForm 10-K in Part I, Item 1 Business, and Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 underthe heading Forward-Looking Statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Companys financialcondition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.  In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financialperformance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the FASB or other regulatoryagencies.   "
12,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2012-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  M&T andits subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by various risks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and creditrisk, among others. Adverse experience with these or other risks could have a material impact on the Companys financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, andM&Ts common stock, in particular.   25 Table of ContentsInterest Rate Risk  The Company is exposed to interest rate risk in its corebanking activities of lending and deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a result, net interest income, which represents the largest revenue source for theCompany, is subject to the effects of changing interest rates. The Company closely monitors the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as interest rates change.The Company makes use of both on- and off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such risk include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products,modifying the composition of earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to, modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes. Liquidity Risk  Liquidity refers to the Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets areavailable to satisfy current and future financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instrumentsincluded in assets and liabilities differ. The Company obtains funding through deposits and various short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase, brokeredcertificates of deposit, Cayman Islands branch deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York and others. Should the Company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or should theavailability of funding become restricted due to disruption in the financial markets, the Companys ability to obtain funding from these or other sources could be negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such credit-event risk bymodeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit, availablecapacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets. To mitigate such risk, the Company maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York that are secured by loansand investment securities. On an ongoing basis, management closely monitors the Companys liquidity position for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs in the normalcourse of business.  Credit Risk  Factors that influence the Companys credit loss experience include overalleconomic conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and, due to the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolio and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Other factors thatcan influence the Companys credit loss experience, in addition to general economic conditions and borrowers specific abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of declining real estate values in the Companys portfolioof loans to residential real estate builders and developers; (ii) the repayment performance associated with the Companys portfolio of residential mortgage loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting mortgage-relatedsecurities; (iii) the concentrations of commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan portfolio; (iv) the amount of commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of the New York Citymetropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other regions of the country; and (v) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans to individualconsumers, which historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than many other loan types. Considerable concerns exist about economic conditions in both national and international markets; the level andvolatility of energy prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; high levels of unemployment; the impact of economic conditions on businesses operationsand abilities to repay loans in light of continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued uncertainty about possible responses to state and local government budget deficits. Numerous factors can affect the Companys credit loss experience. To help manage credit risk, the Company maintains a detailed creditpolicy and utilizes various committees that include members of senior management to approve significant extensions of credit. The Company also maintains a credit review department that regularly reviews the Companys loan and lease portfoliosto ensure compliance with established credit policy. The Company utilizes a loan grading system which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans. Loan grades are utilized to differentiate risk within the portfolio and consider theexpectations of default for each loan. Commercial loans and commercial real estate loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible pass loan grades and are generally ascribed lower loss factors when determiningthe allowance for credit losses. Loans with an elevated level of credit risk are   26 Table of Contentsclassified as criticized and are ascribed a higher loss factor when determining the allowance for credit losses. Criticized loans may be classified as nonaccrual if theCompany no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent 90 days or more. Loan officers with the support of loan review personnel in different geographic locations areresponsible to continuously review and reassign loan grades to pass and criticized loans based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in theirrespective geographic regions. On a quarterly basis, the Companys centralized loan review department reviews all larger balance criticized commercial and commercial real estate loans to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade,including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing. For criticized nonaccrual loans, additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers, workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of therelationships. In analyzing criticized loans, borrower-specific information is reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent developments and the borrowers outlook, and other pertinent data. The timing and extent ofpotential losses, considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the Companys potential courses of action are reviewed. The collectibility of other loans is generally evaluated collectively by loan type after considering such factorsas payment performance and recent loss experience and trends, which are mainly driven by current collateral values in the market place as well as the amount of loan defaults. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that inmanagements judgment appropriately reflects the losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio. In addition, the Company regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be characterized asother than temporary. Any declines in value below amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are charged to earnings.  Economic Risk  The U.S. economy experienced weak economic conditions during the last several years. Those conditions contributed to risk as follows:    The significant downturn in the residential real estate market that began in 2007 continued through the 2011 year-end. The impact of that downturnhas resulted in depressed home prices, higher than historical levels of foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on investment securities backed by residential real estate. Those factors have negatively impacted M&Tsresults of operations and could continue to do so.    Lower demand for the Companys products and services and lower revenues and earnings could result from ongoing weak economic conditions. Thoseconditions could also result in higher loan charge-offs due to the inability of borrowers to repay loans.    Lower fee income from the Companys brokerage and trust businesses could result from significant declines in stock market prices.   Lower earnings could result from other-than-temporary impairment charges related to the Companys investment securities portfolio.   Higher FDIC assessments could be imposed on the Company due to bank failures that have caused the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund to fall below minimumrequired levels.    There is no assurance that the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will improve thecondition of the financial markets.  Supervision and Regulation  The Company is subject toextensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in general, including laws related to corporate taxation. Many of those laws and regulations are described in Part I,Item 1 Business. Changes in those or other laws and regulations, or the degree of the Companys compliance with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee theCompany, could have a significant effect on the Companys operations and its financial results. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act represents a comprehensive overhaul of the financial services industry within the United States and requires federalagencies to implement many new rules. It is expected that at a minimum those new rules will result in increased costs, decreased revenues and more stringent capital and liquidity requirements. Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual Report onForm 10-K in Part I, Item 1 Business, and Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 underthe heading Forward-Looking Statements is included a description of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by management that are difficult to predict and that could materially affect the Companys financialcondition and results of operations, as well as the value of the Companys financial instruments in general, and M&T common stock, in particular.   27 Table of ContentsIn addition, the market price of M&T common stock may fluctuate significantly inresponse to a number of other factors, including changes in securities analysts estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in market valuations of similarcompanies and changes in accounting policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies.   "

Credit Risk  Factors that influence the    Companys credit loss experience include overall economic    conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and,    due to the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolio    and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real    estate valuations, in particular. Other factors that can    influence the Companys credit loss experience, in addition    to general economic conditions and borrowers specific    abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of    declining real estate values in the Companys portfolio of    loans to residential real estate builders and developers;    (ii) the repayment performance associated with the    Companys portfolio of alternative residential mortgage    loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting    mortgage-related securities; (iii) the concentration of    commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan    portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured    by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York    City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of    commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New    York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in    central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less    economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other    regions of the country; and (v) the size of the    Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which    historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a    percentage of loans outstanding than many other loan types.    Considerable concerns exist about the economic recovery in both    national and international markets; the level and volatility of    energy prices; a weakened housing market; the troubled state of    financial and credit markets; Federal Reserve positioning of    monetary policy; high unemployment, which has caused consumer    spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses    operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending    slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New    York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued uncertainty    about possible responses to state government budget deficits.24    Table of Contents     Numerous factors can affect the Companys credit loss    experience. To help manage credit risk, the Company maintains a    detailed credit policy and utilizes various committees that    include members of senior management to approve significant    extensions of credit. The Company also maintains a credit review    department that regularly reviews the Companys loan and    lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit    policy. The Company utilizes an extensive loan grading system    which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate    loans. On a quarterly basis, the Companys loan review    department reviews all commercial and commercial real estate    loans greater than $350,000 that are classified as Special    Mention or worse. Meetings are held with loan officers and their    managers, workout specialists and Senior Management to discuss    each of the relationships. Borrower-specific information is    reviewed, including operating results, future cash flows, recent    developments and the borrowers outlook, and other    pertinent data. The timing and extent of potential losses,    considering collateral valuation and other factors, and the    Companys potential courses of action are reviewed. The    Company maintains an allowance for credit losses that in    managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherent    in the loan and lease portfolio. In addition, the Company    regularly reviews its investment securities for declines in    value below amortized cost that might be characterized as    other than temporary. Any declines in value below    amortized cost that are deemed to be other than    temporary are charged to earnings.    Economic Risk  The U.S. economy experienced    recession and weak economic conditions during the last three    years. Those conditions contributed to risk as follows:       The significant downturn in the residential real estate market    that began in 2007 had continued in 2008 and 2009. The impact of    that downturn has resulted in declining home prices, higher    foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on    investment securities backed by residential real estate. These    factors have negatively impacted M&Ts results of    operations and could continue to do so.       Lower demand for the Companys products and services and    lower revenues and earnings could result from ongoing weak    economic conditions. Those conditions could also result in    higher loan charge-offs due to the inability of borrowers to    repay loans.       Lower fee income from the Companys brokerage and trust    businesses could result from significant declines in stock    market prices.       Lower earnings could result from other-than-temporary impairment    charges related to the Companys investment securities    portfolio.       Higher FDIC assessments could be imposed on the Company due to    bank failures that have caused the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund    to fall below minimum required levels.       There is no assurance that the Emergency Economic Stabilization    Act of 2008 or the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of    2009 will improve the condition of the financial markets.     Supervision and Regulation  The Company is subject to    extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the    banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in    general, including laws related to corporate taxation. Many of    those laws and regulations are described in Part I,    Item 1 Business. Changes in those or other laws    and regulations, or the degree of the Companys compliance    with those laws and regulations as judged by any of several    regulators, including tax authorities, that oversee the Company,    could have a significant effect on the Companys operations    and its financial results.    Detailed discussions of the specific risks outlined above and    other risks facing the Company are included within this Annual    Report on    Form 10-K    in Part I, Item 1 Business, and    Part II, Item 7 Managements Discussion and    Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.    Furthermore, in Part II, Item 7 under the heading    Forward-Looking Statements is included a description    of certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions identified by    management that are difficult to predict and that could    materially affect the Companys financial condition and    results of operations, as well as the value of the    Companys financial instruments in general, and M&T    common stock, in particular.    In addition, the market price of M&T common stock may    fluctuate significantly in response to a number of other    factors, including changes in securities analysts    estimates of financial performance, volatility of stock market    prices and volumes, rumors or erroneous information, changes in    market valuations of similar companies and changes in accounting    policies or procedures as may be required by the Financial    Accounting Standards Board or other regulatory agencies.25    Table of Contents "

As a financial institution, the Company has significant exposure    to market risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk and    credit risk, among others. Adverse experience with these or    other risks could have a material impact on the Companys    financial condition and results of operations, as well as on the    value of the Companys financial instruments in general,    and M&Ts common stock, in particular.22    Table of Contents     Interest Rate Risk  The Company is exposed to    interest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending and    deposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at different    times and by different amounts as interest rates change. As a    result, net interest income, which represents the largest    revenue source for the Company, is subject to the effects of    changing interest rates. The Company closely monitors the    sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates    and attempts to limit the variability of net interest income as    interest rates change. The Company makes use of both on- and    off-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure to    interest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such risk    include, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loan    and deposit products, modifying the composition of earning    assets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,    modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or other    financial instruments used for interest rate risk management    purposes.    Liquidity Risk  Liquidity refers to the    Companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and    liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future    financial obligations, including demands for loans and deposit    withdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporate    purposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of    financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.    The Company obtains funding through deposits and various    short-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federal    funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to    repurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branch    deposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank of New    York and others. Should the Company experience a substantial    deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, or    should the availability of funding become restricted due to    disruption in the financial markets, the Companys ability    to obtain funding from these or other sources could be    negatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify such    credit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the    liquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgrade    over various grading levels. The Company estimates such impact    by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines    of credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources and    securitizable assets. To mitigate such risk, the Company    maintains available lines of credit with the Federal Reserve    Bank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York that    are secured by loans and investment securities. On an ongoing    basis, management closely monitors the Companys liquidity    position for compliance with internal policies and believes that    available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding    needs in the normal course of business.    Credit Risk  Factors that influence the    Companys credit loss experience include overall economic    conditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and,    due to the size of the Companys real estate loan portfolio    and mortgage-related investment securities portfolio, real    estate valuations, in particular. Other factors that can    influence the Companys credit loss experience, in addition    to general economic conditions and borrowers specific    abilities to repay loans, include: (i) the impact of    declining real estate values in the Companys portfolio of    loans to residential real estate builders and developers;    (ii) the repayment performance associated with the    Companys portfolio of alternative residential mortgage    loans and residential and other mortgage loans supporting    mortgage-related securities; (iii) the concentration of    commercial real estate loans in the Companys loan    portfolio, particularly the large concentration of loans secured    by properties in New York State, in general, and in the New York    City metropolitan area, in particular; (iv) the amount of    commercial and industrial loans to businesses in areas of New    York State outside of the New York City metropolitan area and in    central Pennsylvania that have historically experienced less    economic growth and vitality than the vast majority of other    regions of the country; and (v) the size of the    Companys portfolio of loans to individual consumers, which    historically have experienced higher net charge-offs as a    percentage of loans outstanding than many other loan types.    Throughout 2008, there had been considerable concerns about the    deepening economic downturn in both national and international    markets; the level and volatility of energy prices; a weakened    housing market; the troubled state of financial and credit    markets; Federal Reserve positioning of monetary policy; rising    private sector layoffs and unemployment, which caused consumer    spending to slow; the underlying impact on businesses    operations and abilities to repay loans as consumer spending    slowed; continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New    York and central Pennsylvania regions; and continued slowing of    automobile sales. Late in 2008 the U.S economy was identified as    having been in recession since the fourth quarter of 2007.    However, given that approximately 70% of the Companys    loans are to customers in New York State and Pennsylvania,    including a large portion to customers in the23    Table of Contents     traditionally slower growth or stagnant regions of upstate New    York and Central Pennsylvania, the impact of deteriorating    national market conditions was not as pronounced on borrowers in    these regions as compared with other areas of the country. Home    prices in upstate New York and central Pennsylvania    increased in 2008, in sharp contrast to steep declines in values    in other regions of the country. Therefore, despite the    conditions, as previously described, the most severe credit    issues experienced by the Company through 2008 were centered    around residential real estate, including loans to developers    and builders of residential real estate in areas other than New    York state and Pennsylvania. In response, throughout 2008 the    Company conducted detailed reviews of all loans to residential    real estate builders and developers that exceeded    $2.5 million. Those credit reviews were updated throughout    the year and resulted in adjustments to loan grades and, if    appropriate, commencement of intensified collection efforts,    including foreclosure. With regard to residential real estate    loans, with special emphasis on the portfolio of Alt-A mortgage    loans, the Company expanded its collections and loan work-out    staff and further refined its loss identification and estimation    techniques by reference to loan performance and house price    depreciation data in specific areas of the country where    collateral that was securing the Companys residential real    estate loans was located.    All of these factors can affect the Companys credit loss    experience. To help manage credit risk, the Company maintains a    detailed credit policy and utilizes various committees that    include members of senior management to approve significant    extensions of credit. The Company also maintains a credit review    department that regularly reviews the Companys loan and    lease portfolios to ensure compliance with established credit    policy. The Company maintains an allowance for credit losses    that in managements judgment is adequate to absorb losses    inherent in the loan and lease portfolio.

Economic Risk  The U.S. economy was in recession    during 2008. As a result, several additional risk factors have    been identified, as follows:       The significant downturn in the residential real estate market    that began in 2007 had continued in 2008. The impact of that    downturn has resulted in declining home prices, higher    foreclosures and loan charge-offs, and lower market prices on    investment securities backed by residential real estate. These    factors could negatively impact M&Ts results of    operations.       Lower demand for Companys products and services and lower    revenues and earnings could result from an economic recession.       Lower fee income from the Companys brokerage and trust    businesses could result from significant declines in stock    market prices.       Lower earnings could result from other-than temporary impairment    charges related to the Companys investment securities    portfolio.       Higher FDIC insurance costs due to bank failures that have    caused the FDIC Deposit Insurance Fund to fall below minimum    required levels.       There is no assurance that the Emergency Economic Stabilization    Act of 2008 will improve the condition of the financial markets.     Supervision and Regulation  The Company is subject to    extensive state and federal laws and regulations governing the    banking industry, in particular, and public companies, in    general, including laws related to corporate taxation.

1,MTB,M & T BANK CORP,2006-02-28,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.M&Tand its subsidiaries could be adversely impacted by variousrisks and uncertainties which are difficult to predict. As afinancial institution, the Company has significant exposure tomarket risk, including interest-rate risk, liquidity risk andcredit risk, among others. Adverse experience with these orother risks could have a material impact on the Companysfinancial condition and results of operations, as well as on thevalue of the Companys financial instruments in general,and M&Ts common stock, in particular.       Interest Rate Risk  The Company is exposed tointerest rate risk in its core banking activities of lending anddeposit-taking since assets and liabilities reprice at differenttimes and by different amounts as interest rates change. As aresult, net interest income, which represents the largestrevenue source for the Company, is subject to the effects ofchanging interest rates. The Company closely monitors thesensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest ratesand attempts to limit the variability of net interest income asinterest rates change. The Company makes use of both on- andoff-balance sheet financial instruments to mitigate exposure tointerest rate risk. Possible actions to mitigate such riskinclude, but are not limited to, changes in the pricing of loanand deposit products, modifying the composition of earningassets and interest-bearing liabilities, and adding to,modifying or terminating interest rate swap agreements or otherfinancial instruments used for interest rate risk managementpurposes.       Liquidity Risk  Liquidity refers to theCompanys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow andliquid assets are available to satisfy current and futurefinancial obligations, including demands for loans and depositwithdrawals, funding operating costs, and for other corporatepurposes. Liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities offinancial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ.The Company obtains funding through deposits and variousshort-term and long-term wholesale borrowings, including federalfunds purchased and securities sold under agreements torepurchase, brokered certificates of deposit, offshore branchdeposits and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank ofNew York and others. Should the Company experience a substantialdeterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings, orshould the availability of funding become restricted due todisruption in the financial markets, the Companys abilityto obtain funding from these or other sources could benegatively impacted. The Company attempts to quantify suchcredit-event risk by modeling scenarios that estimate theliquidity impact resulting from a short-term ratings downgradeover various grading levels. The Company estimates such impactby attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured linesof credit, available capacity from secured borrowing sources andsecuritizable assets. To mitigate such risk, the Companymaintains available lines of credit with the Federal ReserveBank of New York and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New Yorkthat are secured by loans and investment securities. On anongoing basis, management closely monitors the Companysliquidity position for compliance with internal policies andbelieves that available sources of liquidity are adequate tomeet funding needs in the normal course of business.       Credit Risk  Factors that influence theCompanys credit loss experience include overall economicconditions affecting businesses and consumers, in general, and,due to the size of the Companys commercial real estateloan portfolio, real estate valuations, in particular. Otherfactors that can influence the Companys credit lossexperience, in addition to general economic conditions andborrowers specific abilities to repay loans, include:(i) the concentration of commercial real estate loans inthe Companys loan portfolio, particularly the largeconcentration of loans secured by properties in New York State,in general, and in the New York City metropolitan area, inparticular; (ii) the amount of commercial and industrialloans to businesses in areas of New York State outside of theNew York City metropolitan area and in central Pennsylvania thathave historically experienced less economic growth and vitalitythan the vast majority of other regions of the country; and(iii) the size of the Companys portfolio of loans toindividual consumers, which historically have experienced highernet charge-offs as a percentage of loans outstanding than otherloan types. Although the 2006 economic outlook predicts moderatenational growth with inflation expected to be reasonably wellcontained,23 concerns exist about higher energy prices; a waning housingboom; Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy; theunderlying impact on businesses operations and abilitiesto repay loans resulting from rising interest rates; sluggishjob creation, which could cause consumer spending to slow;continued stagnant population growth in the upstate New York andcentral Pennsylvania regions; and sluggish commercial loandemand in many market areas served by the Company. All of thesefactors can affect the Companys credit loss experience. Tohelp manage credit risk, the Company maintains a detailed creditpolicy and utilizes various committees that include members ofsenior management to approve significant extensions of credit.The Company also maintains a credit review department thatregularly reviews the Companys loan and lease portfoliosto ensure compliance with established credit policy. The Companymaintains an allowance for credit losses that inmanagements judgment is adequate to absorb losses inherentin the loan and lease portfolio.       Supervision and Regulation  The Company is subject toextensive state and federal laws and regulations governing thebanking industry, in particular, and public companies, ingeneral.
