9,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2024-02-14,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and the performance of its business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; •changes in the price of oil;•construction costs; and•weather-related events.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the ADA may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space on favorable terms or at all.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on favorable terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We may be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and funds available for distribution to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases for any reason, including because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating 10to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where we believe market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•disruption in supply and delivery chains;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management’s time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as we project;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2023, our largest markets were Houston and Dallas.  We owned operating properties totaling 6.8 million square feet in Houston and 5.4 million square feet in Dallas, which represent 10.7% and 9.6%, respectively, of the Company’s total Real estate properties based on percentage of total annualized base rent (as defined in Item 2. Properties).  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  In addition, our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution 11sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property. A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Climate change and its effects, including compliance with new laws or regulations such as “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition. To the extent that climate change causes an increase in catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods, our properties may be susceptible to an increase in weather-related damage.  Even in the absence of direct physical damage to our properties, the occurrence of any natural disasters or a changing climate in the area of any of our properties could have a material adverse effect on business, supply chains and the economy generally.  Climate change could cause an increase in property and casualty insurance premiums.  The potential impacts of future climate change on our properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral.  In addition, any proposed legislation enacted to address climate change could increase the costs of energy, utilities and overall development. The resulting costs of any proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our debt will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may negatively impact our financial ratios, such as our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio, our debt-to-EBITDAre ratio and our fixed charge coverage ratio.  Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining minimum debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the 12instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2023, we had no variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur variable rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.The number of shares of our common stock available for future sale and future offerings of debt or equity securities may be dilutive to existing stockholders and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  Our ability to execute our business strategy depends on our access to an appropriate blend of equity and debt financing, including common and preferred stock, lines of credit and other forms of secured and unsecured debt. We have filed a registration statement with the SEC allowing us to offer, from time to time, an indefinite amount of equity securities on an as-needed basis, including shares under our Current 2023 ATM Program (as defined below). Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock (or the perception that such sales might occur), the issuance of common stock in connection with acquisitions and other equity issuances may dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market prices of our securities, or both. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.  Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. Thus, our stockholders bear the risk of future offerings reducing the market prices of our securities and diluting their proportionate ownership.The lack of certain limitations on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, we may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.General Risk Factors
Inflation and related volatility in the economy could negatively impact our tenants, our results of operations and the value of our publicly-traded equity securities.  Inflation and its related impacts, including increased prices for services and goods and higher interest rates and wages, and any fiscal or other policy interventions by the U.S. government in reaction to such events, could negatively impact our tenants’ businesses or our results of operations. Most of our leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, although a limited number of tenants have capped the amount of these operating expenses they are responsible for under their lease. As a result, we believe that most of our leases mitigate our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. However, there can be no assurance that our tenants would be able to absorb these expense increases and be able to continue to pay us their portion of operating expenses, capital expenditures and rent. In addition, while most of our leases provide for scheduled rent increases, high levels of inflation could outpace these increases. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our minimum debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to shareholders could be adversely affected over time. There is no guarantee that we will be able to mitigate the effects of inflation and related impacts, and the duration and extent of any prolonged periods of inflation, and any related adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition, remain unknown at this time.13Additionally, inflationary pricing may have a negative effect on the construction costs necessary to complete our development projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction materials, labor and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Higher construction costs could adversely impact our investments in real estate assets and our expected yields on development and value-add projects.  Although the Company has an obligation to complete development projects currently under construction, the Company does not have any obligation to start new development projects in the future.  EastGroup evaluates new development projects on a case-by-case basis including many factors such as construction costs, potential yields, and tenant demand, and no assurance can be given that inflationary pricing will not have a material adverse impact on our development pipeline and future results.  Inflation may also cause increased volatility in financial markets, which could affect our ability to access the capital markets or impact the cost or timing at which we are able to do so. To the extent our exposure to increases in interest rates on any of our debt is not eliminated through interest rate swaps and interest rate protection agreements, such increases will result in higher debt service costs, which will adversely affect our cash flows. Our exposure to increases in interest rates in the short term includes our variable-rate borrowings.  With the exception of the unsecured bank credit facilities, all of the Company’s debt has an effectively fixed interest rate.  See “Financing Risks – Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.” Increases in interest rates could also increase our debt financing costs over time, either through near-term borrowings on our existing unsecured bank credit facilities or refinancing of our existing borrowings that may incur incrementally higher interest rates.One of the factors that may influence the trading price of our publicly-traded common stock is the interest rate on our debt and the dividend yield on our common stock relative to market interest rates. As market interest rates rise, unless we eliminate our exposure to such increases, our borrowing costs may rise and result in less funds being available for distribution. Therefore, we may not be able to, or we may choose not to, provide a higher distribution rate on our common stock. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our properties. These factors could result in a decline in the market prices of our common stock. There is no guarantee we will be able to mitigate the impact of inflation.The market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be affected by the market’s perception of our operating results, growth potential, and current and future cash dividends and may also be affected by the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock may also be influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access capital markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification. The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service. Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any dividends to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, subject to certain limitations in the Internal Revenue Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual, trust and estate stockholders may be eligible to treat the dividends received from us as qualified dividend income taxable as net capital gains under the provisions of Section 1(h)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, non-corporate stockholders (including individuals) will not be able to deduct 20% of certain dividends they receive from us in accordance with Section 199A of the Internal Revenue Code. The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex, and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REIT qualification is limited. Although we believe we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that will 14continue to qualify us as a REIT, we cannot be certain that we have been or will be successful in continuing to be taxed as a REIT. In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  Legislative or regulatory action with respect to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company and our stockholders.  We are subject to state and local tax laws and regulations.  Changes in state and local tax laws or regulations may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.  In addition, in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. We cannot assure you that future changes to tax laws and regulations will not have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock.To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one stockholder can own.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:•the REIT ownership limit described above;•special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board or by stockholders possessing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;•our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval; and•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.In addition, Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations and certain “business combinations” and “control share acquisitions.”  Our bylaws contain provisions exempting us from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act and the Maryland Business Combination Act. Our bylaws prohibit the repeal, amendment or alteration of our Maryland Control Share Acquisition opt out without the approval by the Company’s stockholders; however, there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at some time in the future.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer’s employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer’s average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer’s agreement, together with the officer’s base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are 15unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or cyber-attack of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet and third-party cloud-based service providers, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and to maintain personal identifying information and customer and lease data. We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of data relating to our business operations (including our financial transactions and records) and confidential customer data (including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts). Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of our business operations or personally identifiable information such as in the event of cybersecurity incidents. Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, phishing or spoofing attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause. Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any cybersecurity incident may be costly, notwithstanding any cyber liability insurance we may carry.  See “Item 1C. Cybersecurity” for further discussion.We may be impacted by changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies.  Any changes to U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business"
16,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2023-02-15,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and the performance of its business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; •changes in the price of oil;•construction costs; and•weather-related events.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the ADA may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space on favorable terms or at all.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on favorable terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We may be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and funds available for distribution to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases for any reason, including because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the 10amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where we believe market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•disruption in supply and delivery chains;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management’s time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as we project;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2022, our largest markets were Houston and Dallas.  We owned operating properties totaling 6.2 million square feet in Houston and 4.9 million square feet in Dallas, which represent 12.0% and 9.3%, respectively, of the Company’s total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  In addition, our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.11We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Climate change and its effects, including compliance with new laws or regulations such as “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition. To the extent that climate change causes an increase in catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods, our properties may be susceptible to an increase in weather-related damage.  Even in the absence of direct physical damage to our properties, the occurrence of any natural disasters or a changing climate in the area of any of our properties could have a material adverse effect on business, supply chains and the economy generally.  Climate change could cause an increase in property and casualty insurance premiums.  The potential impacts of future climate change on our properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral.  In addition, any proposed legislation enacted to address climate change could increase the costs of energy, utilities and overall development. The resulting costs of any proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our debt will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may negatively impact our financial ratios, such as our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio, our debt-to-EBITDAre ratio and our fixed charge coverage ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.12Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2022, we had $170,000,000 of variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.The discontinuation of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our borrowing costs and could impact our business and results of operations.  In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“AARC”), which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a recommended spread adjustment as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR-BBA. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured rate, and SOFR is an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities.  We expect that all LIBOR settings relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. As a result, any of our LIBOR-based borrowings and hedges that extend beyond such date have been amended to modify the index from LIBOR to SOFR.  Concurrently, the related swaps were amended to reference SOFR rather than LIBOR.  While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until June 30, 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point.  This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator.  In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. The lack of certain limitations on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, we may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksInflation and related volatility in the economy could negatively impact our tenants, our results of operations and the value of our publicly-traded equity securities. Inflation in the United States accelerated rapidly in 2022 and is expected to continue at an elevated level in the near-term. Inflation and its related impacts, including increased prices for services and goods and higher interest rates and wages, and any fiscal or other policy interventions by the U.S. government in reaction to such events, could negatively impact our tenants’ businesses or our results of operations. Most of our leases require the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses, including real estate taxes, insurance and common area maintenance, although a limited number of tenants have capped the amount of these operating expenses they are responsible for under their lease. As a result, we believe that most of our leases mitigate our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation. However, there can be no assurance that our tenants would be able to absorb these expense increases and be able to continue to pay us their portion of operating expenses, capital expenditures and rent. In addition, while most of our leases provide for scheduled rent increases, high levels of inflation could outpace these increases. As a result, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to shareholders could be adversely affected over time. There is no guarantee that we will be able to mitigate the effects of inflation and related impacts, and the duration and extent of any prolonged periods of inflation, and any related adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition, remain unknown at this time.13Additionally, inflationary pricing may have a negative effect on the construction costs necessary to complete our development projects, including, but not limited to, costs of construction materials, labor and services from third-party contractors and suppliers. Higher construction costs could adversely impact our investments in real estate assets and our expected yields on development and value-add projects.  Although the Company has an obligation to complete development projects currently under construction, the Company does not have any obligation to start new development projects in the future.  EastGroup evaluates new development projects on a case-by-case basis including many factors such as construction costs, potential yields, and tenant demand, and no assurance can be given that inflationary pricing will not have a material adverse impact on our development pipeline and future results.  Inflation may also cause increased volatility in financial markets, which could affect our ability to access the capital markets or impact the cost or timing at which we are able to do so. To the extent our exposure to increases in interest rates on any of our debt is not eliminated through interest rate swaps and interest rate protection agreements, such increases will result in higher debt service costs, which will adversely affect our cash flows. Our exposure to increases in interest rates in the short term includes our variable-rate borrowings.  With the exception of the unsecured bank credit facilities, all of the Company’s debt has an effectively fixed interest rate.  See “Financing Risks – Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.” Increases in interest rates could also increase our debt financing costs over time, either through near-term borrowings on our existing unsecured bank credit facilities or refinancing of our existing borrowings that may incur incrementally higher interest rates.One of the factors that may influence the trading price of our publicly-traded common stock is the interest rate on our debt and the dividend yield on our common stock relative to market interest rates. As market interest rates rise, unless we eliminate our exposure to such increases, our borrowing costs may rise and result in less funds being available for distribution. Therefore, we may not be able to, or we may choose not to, provide a higher distribution rate on our common stock. In addition, fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect the market value of our properties. These factors could result in a decline in the market prices of our common stock. There is no guarantee we will be able to mitigate the impact of inflation.The market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be affected by the market’s perception of our operating results, growth potential, and current and future cash dividends and may also be affected by the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock may also be influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification. The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service. Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any dividends to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, subject to certain limitations in the Internal Revenue Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual, trust and estate stockholders may be eligible to treat the dividends received from us as qualified dividend income taxable as net capital gains under the provisions of Section 1(h)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, non-corporate stockholders (including individuals) will not be able to deduct 20% of certain dividends they receive from us. The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex, and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REIT qualification is limited. Although we believe we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that will continue to qualify us as a REIT, we cannot be certain that we have been or will be successful in continuing to be taxed as a REIT. In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond 14our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  Legislative or regulatory action with respect to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company and our stockholders.  We are subject to state and local tax laws and regulations.  Changes in state and local tax laws or regulations may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.  In addition, in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. We cannot assure you that future changes to tax laws and regulations will not have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock.To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one stockholder can own.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:•the REIT ownership limit described above;•special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board or by stockholders possessing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;•our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval; and•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.In addition, Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations and certain “business combinations” and “control share acquisitions.”  Our bylaws contain provisions exempting us from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act and the Maryland Business Combination Act. Our bylaws prohibit the repeal, amendment or alteration of our Maryland Control Share Acquisition opt out without the approval by the Company’s stockholders; however, there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at some time in the future.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer’s employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer’s average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer’s agreement, together with the officer’s base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.15We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or cyber-attack of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and to maintain personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of data relating to our business operations (including our financial transactions and records) and confidential customer data (including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts).  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of our business operations or personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, phishing or spoofing attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be impacted by changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies.  Any changes to U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.Pandemics, such as COVID-19, and mitigation efforts to control their spread may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic, including the ongoing emergence of viral variants, has caused and could continue to cause widespread disruptions to the U.S. and global economy and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are affected by our ability to lease our properties and collect rental revenues, renew our leases or lease vacant space on favorable terms, and the health and well-being of our customers, employees and other stakeholders, all of which could be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other pandemics. In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic, its macroeconomic effects or the government responses thereto adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, they may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors
” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K"
4,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2022-02-16,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and the performance of its business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations. Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;8•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; •changes in the price of oil;•construction costs; •weather-related events; and•continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of emerging variants and any related mitigation actions by governments or businesses, on our business and our tenants.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space on favorable terms or at all.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on favorable terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We may be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and funds available for distribution to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases for any reason, including because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where we believe market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•disruption in supply and delivery chains;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management’s time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and9•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as we project;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2021, our largest markets were Houston and Dallas.  We owned operating properties totaling 6.2 million square feet in Houston and 4.7 million square feet in Dallas, which represent 13.2% and 10.0%, respectively, of the Company’s total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  In addition, our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, 10such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Climate change and its effects, including compliance with new laws or regulations such as “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition. To the extent that climate change causes an increase in catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods, our properties may be susceptible to an increase in weather-related damage.  Even in the absence of direct physical damage to our properties, the occurrence of any natural disasters or a changing climate in the area of any of our properties could have a material adverse effect on business, supply chains and the economy generally.  Climate change could cause an increase in property and casualty insurance premiums.  The potential impacts of future climate change on our properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral.  In addition, any proposed legislation enacted to address climate change could increase the costs of energy, utilities and overall development. The resulting costs of any proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our debt will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may negatively impact our financial ratios, such as our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio, our debt-to-EBITDAre ratio and our fixed charge coverage ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2021, we had $209,210,000 of variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy 11is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.The discontinuation of LIBOR and the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may adversely affect our borrowing costs and could impact our business and results of operations.  The LIBOR benchmark has been the subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform and replacement, with most LIBOR tenors not expected to be published after June 30, 2023.  In the U.S., the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (“AARC”), which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) plus a recommended spread adjustment as its preferred alternative to USD-LIBOR. There are significant differences between LIBOR and SOFR, such as LIBOR being an unsecured lending rate while SOFR is a secured rate, and SOFR is an overnight rate while LIBOR reflects term rates at different maturities.  We expect that all LIBOR settings relevant to us will cease to be published or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023. As a result, any of our LIBOR-based borrowings that extend beyond such date will need to be converted to a replacement rate.  Certain risks may arise in connection with transitioning contracts to SOFR or any other alternative variable rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur. The value of loans, securities, or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted.  The Company’s unsecured bank credit facilities, senior unsecured term loans and interest rate swap contracts are indexed to LIBOR and include provisions for a replacement rate which we believe will be substantially equivalent to the all-in LIBOR-based interest rate in effect prior to its replacement.  It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR’s end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rates will replace LIBOR.  The Company is continuously monitoring and evaluating the related risks, which include interest on loans and amounts received and paid on derivative instruments.  These risks arise in connection with transitioning contracts to a new alternative rate, including any resulting value transfer that may occur.  The value of loans or derivative instruments tied to LIBOR could also be impacted if LIBOR is limited or discontinued as interest rates may be adversely affected.  While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until June 30, 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point.  This could result, for example, if sufficient banks decline to make submissions to the LIBOR administrator.  In that case, the risks associated with the transition to an alternative reference rate will be accelerated and magnified. The lack of certain limitations on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, we may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be affected by the market’s perception of our operating results, growth potential, and current and future cash dividends and may also be affected by the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock may also be influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. In addition, we may be 12barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification. The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service. Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any dividends to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, subject to certain limitations in the Internal Revenue Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual, trust and estate stockholders may be eligible to treat the dividends received from us as qualified dividend income taxable as net capital gains under the provisions of Section 1(h)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, non-corporate stockholders (including individuals) will not be able to deduct 20% of certain dividends they receive from us. The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex, and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REIT qualification is limited. Although we believe we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that will continue to qualify us as a REIT, we cannot be certain that we have been or will be successful in continuing to be taxed as a REIT. In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  Legislative or regulatory action with respect to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company and our stockholders.  We are subject to state and local tax laws and regulations.  Changes in state and local tax laws or regulations may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.  In addition, in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. We cannot assure you that future changes to tax laws and regulations will not have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock.To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one stockholder can own.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:•the REIT ownership limit described above;•special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board or by stockholders possessing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;•our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval; and•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.In addition, Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations and certain “business combinations” and “control share acquisitions.”  Our bylaws contain provisions exempting us from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act and the Maryland Business Combination Act. Our bylaws prohibit the repeal, amendment or alteration of our Maryland Control Share Acquisition opt out without the approval by the Company’s stockholders; however, there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at some time in the future.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with 13existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer’s employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer’s average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer’s agreement, together with the officer’s base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or cyber-attack of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and to maintain personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of data relating to our business operations (including our financial transactions and records) and confidential customer data (including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts).  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems’ improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of our business operations or personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, phishing or spoofing attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be impacted by changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies.  Any changes to U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.Pandemics, such as COVID-19, and mitigation efforts to control its spread may continue to impact our business.  Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by factors relating to such pandemics.  The COVID-19 pandemic, including the ongoing emergence of viral variants, has caused and could continue to cause widespread disruptions to the U.S. and global economy and has contributed to significant volatility and negative pressure in financial markets. Extraordinary actions have been taken by businesses and by federal, state and local governmental authorities to combat the spread of COVID-19, including issuance of “stay-at-home” directives and mandates for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are affected by our ability to lease our properties and collect rental revenues, renew our leases or lease vacant space on favorable terms, and the health and well-being of our customers, employees and other stakeholders, all of which could be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other pandemics. In addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors
” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K"
13,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2021-02-17,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the performance of its business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations.  The Company refers to itself as “we”, “us” or “our” in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; •changes in the price of oil;•construction costs; and•impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and tenants.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space on favorable terms or at all.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on favorable terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.8We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and funds available for distribution to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases for any reason, including because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where we believe market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as we project;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.9We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2020, our largest markets were Houston, Dallas and Tampa.  We owned operating properties totaling 5.8 million square feet in Houston, 4.6 million square feet in Dallas and 4.5 million square feet in Tampa, which represent 13.2%, 10.4% and 10.3%, respectively, of the Company's total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  In addition, our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Climate change and its effects, including compliance with new laws or regulations such as “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition. To the extent that climate change causes an increase in catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods, our properties may be susceptible to an increase in weather-related damage.  Even in the absence of direct physical damage to our properties, the occurrence of any natural disasters or a changing climate in the area of any of our properties could have a material adverse effect on business, supply chains and the economy generally.  Climate change could cause an increase in property and casualty insurance premiums.  The potential impacts of future climate change on our properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral.  In addition, any proposed legislation enacted to address climate change could increase the costs of energy, utilities and overall development. The resulting costs of any proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our debt will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future 10earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2020, we had $125 million of variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.The lack of certain limitations on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, we may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be affected by the market’s perception of our operating results, growth potential, and current and future cash dividends and may also be affected by the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock may also be influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances 11can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct dividends to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates. In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification. The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service. Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any dividends to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification. If we were to fail to qualify as a REIT, subject to certain limitations in the Internal Revenue Code, corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual, trust and estate stockholders may be eligible to treat the dividends received from us as qualified dividend income taxable as net capital gains under the provisions of Section 1(h)(11) of the Internal Revenue Code. However, non-corporate stockholders (including individuals) will not be able to deduct 20% of certain dividends they receive from us. The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex, and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REIT qualification is limited. Although we believe we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that will continue to qualify us as a REIT, we cannot be certain that we have been or will be successful in continuing to be taxed as a REIT. In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT. We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  Legislative or regulatory action with respect to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company and our stockholders.  We are subject to state and local tax laws and regulations.  Changes in state and local tax laws or regulations may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.In addition, in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. We cannot assure you that future changes to tax laws and regulations will not have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock.To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one stockholder can own.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:•the REIT ownership limit described above;•special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board or by stockholders possessing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;•our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval; and•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.In addition, Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations and certain “business combinations” and “control share acquisitions.”  Our bylaws contain provisions exempting us from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act and the 12Maryland Business Combination Act. Our bylaws prohibit the repeal, amendment or alteration of our Maryland Control Share Acquisition opt out without the approval by the Company’s stockholders; however, there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at some time in the future.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and maintaining personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts.  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be impacted by changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies.  Any changes to U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.Pandemics, such as COVID-19, and mitigation efforts to control the spread of such disease have impacted and are expected to continue to impact our business. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected by factors relating to such pandemics.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the outbreak of COVID-19 as a pandemic.  The United States, where EastGroup’s properties are located, has experienced and is continuing to experience widespread infection, and there is uncertainty regarding how long the pandemic will impact the United States and the rest of the world.  Unprecedented, extraordinary actions have been taken by federal, state and local governmental authorities to combat the spread of COVID-19, including issuance of “stay-at-home” directives and similar mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations.  These measures, while intended to protect human life, have led to, and may continue to lead to, reduced economic activity in certain sectors and an increase in unemployment throughout the United States, including in some markets where our properties are located.  As a result, there has been, and may continue to be, a period of economic slowdown, the severity and duration of which remains uncertain.  Such economic slowdown, among other disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and the financial condition and results of operations of our tenants. Our ability to lease our properties and collect rental revenues and expense reimbursements is dependent upon national, regional and local economic conditions.  The potential inability to renew leases, lease vacant space or re-lease space as leases expire on favorable terms, or at all, could cause a decline in our receipt of rental payments.  We have been in communication with a portion of our customer base regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and have previously received rent relief requests from a number of our customers. Although we may in the future receive additional rent relief requests, they have largely ended.  We have granted rent relief requests from certain of our customers and denied other requests, and we may or may not grant such 13future requests from our customers.  Granting rent relief could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.  Some of our customers are experiencing a deterioration in their financial position, results of operations and cash flows; as a result, some have been unable to pay their rent and expense reimbursements. To date, this has had an immaterial impact on our rent collections. However, if our customers continue to experience such deterioration, this could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Federal, state and local government restrictions associated with the mitigation efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19 could prevent our customers from accessing their leased space and operating their businesses; such restrictions could also impact our ability to operate our business, which may cause the business and operating results to decline or impact our ability to comply with regulatory obligations leading to reputational harm and regulatory issues or fines.  Such restrictions could also inhibit our ability to lease vacant space in our operating portfolio and our development and value-add program.  In addition, government restrictions could prevent construction of tenant improvements and development projects, which could delay construction completion and lease commencement dates.  In each case, we may experience an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.    The economic uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause disruption and instability in the financial markets and may impact our ability to raise capital from debt and equity markets on favorable terms or at all.The health and well-being of our customers, employees, directors and other stakeholders is of great importance to us.  We are striving to accommodate flexible working arrangements to ensure the health and safety of our team, while continuing to perform our job duties and provide services to our customers and other stakeholders.  There are risks associated with remote working arrangements, including, but not limited to, risks related to cyber-security.  We are continuing to monitor and adhere to federal, state and local government guidelines regarding our work arrangements with the goal of preventing the spread of COVID-19 to our workforce, our customers and our communities.  There are risks and uncertainties related to the health of our employees and directors; any potential deterioration of the health of key personnel could impact our business operations. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the current economic, financial and capital markets environment present material risks and uncertainties for us.  However, the rapid development and fluidity of the situation precludes any prediction as to the ultimate impact COVID-19 will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, which will depend largely on future developments directly or indirectly relating to the duration and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.  To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors
” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K"
0,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2020-02-13,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the performance of its business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations.  The Company refers to itself as ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; •changes in the price of oil; and•construction costs.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space on favorable terms or at all.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on favorable terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.7We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and funds available for distribution to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases for any reason, including because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where we believe market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as we project;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.8We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2019, our two largest markets were Houston and Tampa.  We owned operating properties totaling 5.7 million square feet in Houston and 4.3 million square feet in Tampa, which represent 13.9% and 10.5%, respectively, of the Company's total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  In addition, our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Climate change and its effects, including compliance with new laws or regulations such as “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties or result in unanticipated losses that could affect our business and financial condition. To the extent that climate change causes an increase in catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, fires or floods, our properties may be susceptible to an increase in weather-related damage.  Even in the absence of direct physical damage to our properties, the occurrence of any natural disasters or a changing climate in the area of any of our properties could have a material adverse effect on business, supply chains and the economy generally. The potential impacts of future climate change on our properties could adversely affect our ability to lease, develop or sell our properties or to borrow using our properties as collateral.  In addition, any proposed legislation enacted to address climate change could increase the costs of energy, utilities and overall development. The resulting costs of any proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our debt will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.9Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2019, we had $112.7 million of variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.The lack of certain limitations on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, we may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be affected by the market’s perception of our operating results, growth potential, and current and future cash dividends and may also be affected by the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock may also be influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service.  Furthermore, we 10would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification.  Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  The REIT qualification requirements are extremely complex, and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing REIT qualification is limited.  Although we believe we have operated and intend to operate in a manner that will continue to qualify us as a REIT, we cannot be certain that we have been or will be successful in continuing to be taxed as a REIT.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  Legislative or regulatory action with respect to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company and our stockholders.  We are subject to state and local tax laws and regulations.  Changes in state and local tax laws or regulations may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.In addition, in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. We cannot assure you that future changes to tax laws and regulations will not have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock.To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one stockholder can own.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Internal Revenue Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:•the REIT ownership limit described above;•special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board or by stockholders possessing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;•our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval; and•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.In addition, Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations and certain ""business combinations"" and ""control share acquisitions.""  Our bylaws contain provisions exempting us from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act and the Maryland Business Combination Act. Our bylaws prohibit the repeal, amendment or alteration of our Maryland Control Share Acquisition opt out without the approval by the Company’s stockholders; however, there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at some time in the future.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. 11We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and maintaining personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts.  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be impacted by changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies.  Any changes to U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business"
3,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2019-02-14,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the performance of its business.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or that the Company currently deems immaterial also may impair its business operations.  The Company refers to itself as ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; •changes in the price of oil; and•construction costs.23We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space on favorable terms or at all.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on favorable terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and distributions to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases for any reason, including because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;24•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2018, our two largest markets were Houston and Tampa.  We owned operating properties totaling 5.5 million square feet in Houston and 4.2 million square feet in Tampa, which represent 14.1% and 10.7%, respectively, of the Company's total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties.  Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities.  The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events.25Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our debt will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2018, we had $195.7 million of variable-rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable-rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable-rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed-rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, we may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be affected by the market’s perception of our operating results, growth potential, and current and future cash dividends and may also be affected by the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock may be influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.26The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service.  Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification.  Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements.  We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are few judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.Legislative or regulatory action with respect to tax laws and regulations could adversely affect the Company and our stockholders.  On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, informally titled the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, was enacted. The TCJA made major changes to the Code, including a number of provisions of the Code that affect the taxation of REITs and their stockholders. The long-term effect of the significant changes made by the TCJA remains uncertain, and additional administrative guidance will be required in order to fully evaluate the effect of many provisions. The effect of any technical corrections with respect to the TCJA could have an adverse effect on the Company and our stockholders.  We are also subject to state and local tax laws and regulations.  Changes in state and local tax laws or regulations may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.In addition, in recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. Additional changes to tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future, and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder. We cannot assure you that future changes to tax laws and regulations will not have an adverse effect on an investment in our stock.To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one stockholder can own.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent our stockholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:•the REIT ownership limit described above;27•special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board or by stockholders possessing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;•our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval; and•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.In addition, Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations.  The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely because of the effect of the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Maryland law the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director.  Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law.The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an ""interested stockholder"" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met.  An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.  These provisions of Maryland law do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to the statute, our Board of Directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person and such resolution may not be revoked, altered or amended without prior stockholder approval.The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares"" of a corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power:  one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power.  A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders' meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights.  Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions by any person of our stock. Our bylaws prohibit the repeal, amendment or alteration of this provision without the approval by the Company’s stockholders; however, there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at some time in the future.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, 28transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and maintaining personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts.  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be impacted by changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies.  Any changes to U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business"
12,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2018-02-14,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the performance of its business.  The Company refers to itself as ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; •changes in the price of oil; and•construction costs.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent 5us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on similar terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and distributions to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and6•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2017, we owned operating properties totaling 5.5 million square feet in Houston and 4.2 million square feet in Tampa, which represent 14.8% and 11.4%, respectively, of the Company's total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties.  Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities.  The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events.Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our debt will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.7We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2017, we had $116.3 million of variable-rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable-rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable-rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed-rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, we may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be affected by the market’s perception of our operating results, growth potential, and current and future cash dividends and may also be affected by the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock may be influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in 8the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service.  Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification.  Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements.  We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are few judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.  Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted.  Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.  From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one stockholder can own.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:•the REIT ownership limit described above;•special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board or by stockholders possessing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;•our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval; and•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.In addition, Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations.  The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely because of the effect of the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Maryland 9law the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director.  Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law.The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an ""interested stockholder"" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met.  An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.  These provisions of Maryland law do not apply, however, to business combinations that are approved or exempted by a board of directors prior to the time that the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. Pursuant to the statute, our Board of Directors has by resolution exempted business combinations between us and any other person and such resolution may not be revoked, altered or amended without prior stockholder approval.The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares"" of a corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power:  one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power.  A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders' meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights.  Our bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions by any person of our stock. Our bylaws prohibit the repeal, amendment or alteration of this provision without the approval by the Company’s stockholders; however, there can be no assurance that this provision will not be amended or eliminated at some time in the future.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and maintaining personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts.  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.10We may be impacted by changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies.  Any changes to U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business"

•changes in the price of oil; and•construction costs.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.5We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on similar terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and distributions to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and6•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2016, we owned operating properties totaling 5.9 million square feet in Houston, which represents 17.0% of the Company's total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties.  Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities.  The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events.Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our debt will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.7We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2016, we had $112.0 million of variable-rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable-rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable-rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed-rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, we may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be affected by the market’s perception of our operating results, growth potential, and current and future cash dividends and may also be affected by the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock may be influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in 8the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service.  Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification.  Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements.  We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are few judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.  Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted.  Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.  From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.To maintain our status as a REIT, we limit the amount of shares any one stockholder can own.  The Internal Revenue Code imposes certain limitations on the ownership of the stock of a REIT. For example, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding shares of capital stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code) during the last half of any taxable year. To protect our REIT status, our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver. The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control. Certain tax and anti-takeover provisions of our charter and bylaws may inhibit a change of our control. Certain provisions contained in our charter and bylaws and the Maryland General Corporation Law may discourage a third party from making a tender offer or acquisition proposal to us. If this were to happen, it could delay, deter or prevent a change in control or the removal of existing management. These provisions also may delay or prevent the shareholders from receiving a premium for their common shares over then-prevailing market prices. These provisions include:•the REIT ownership limit described above;•special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, a majority of the board or by stockholders possessing a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast at the meeting;•our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval; and•advance-notice requirements for proposals to be presented at stockholder meetings.In addition, Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations.  The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely because of the effect of the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation 9or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Maryland law the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director.  Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law.The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an ""interested stockholder"" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met.  An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares"" of a corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power:  one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power.  A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders' meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and maintaining personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts.  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may be impacted by changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or laws and policies.  Any changes to U.S. tax laws, foreign trade, manufacturing, and development and investment in the territories and countries where our customers operate could adversely affect our operating results and our business.10"

As of December 31, 2015, we owned operating properties totaling 6.6 million square feet in Houston, which represents 19.1% of the Company's total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This

without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties.  Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities.  The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events.Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our mortgages will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.7We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2015, we had $150.8 million of variable-rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable-rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable-rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed-rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, our Board of Directors may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and current and future cash dividends and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock is influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in 8the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service.  Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification.  Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements.  We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are few judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.  Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted.  Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.  From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.Our charter contains provisions that may adversely affect the value of EastGroup stock.  Our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver.  The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control.  Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting.  We also require advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or the proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.Our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval.  Under our Charter, the Board has the power to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital stock with such preferences, rights, powers and restrictions as the Board of Directors may determine.  The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' best interests.9Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.  Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations.  The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely because of the effect of the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Maryland law the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director.  Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law.The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an ""interested stockholder"" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met.  An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares"" of a corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power:  one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power.  A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders' meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and maintaining personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts.  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
6,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2015-02-17,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the performance of its business.  The Company refers to itself as ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; •changes in the price of oil; and•construction costs.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent 5us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on similar terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also routinely develop properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and distributions to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and6•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  As of December 31, 2014, we owned operating properties totaling 6.2 million square feet in Houston, which represents 18.6% of the Company's total Real estate properties on a square foot basis.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties.  Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities.  The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events.Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our mortgages will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.7We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2014, we had $99.4 million of variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful.

Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements.  We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are few judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.  Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted.  Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.  From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.Our Charter contains provisions that may adversely affect the value of EastGroup stock.  Our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver.  The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control.  Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting.  We also require advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or the proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.Our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval.  Under our Charter, the Board has the power to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital stock with such preferences, rights, powers and restrictions as the Board of Directors may determine.  The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' best interests.9Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.  Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations.  The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely because of the effect of the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Maryland law the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director.  Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law.The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an ""interested stockholder"" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met.  An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares"" of a corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power:  one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power.  A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders' meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights.We rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our business.  We rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes, including financial transactions and records, and maintaining personal identifying information and customer and lease data.  We purchase some of our information technology from vendors, on whom our systems depend.  We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for the processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer data, including individually identifiable information relating to financial accounts.  Although we have taken steps to protect the security of our information systems and the data maintained in those systems, it is possible that our safety and security measures will not prevent the systems' improper functioning or damage, or the improper access or disclosure of personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks.  Security breaches, including physical or electronic break-ins, computer viruses, attacks by hackers and similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.  In some cases, it may be difficult to anticipate or immediately detect such incidents and the damage they cause.  Any failure to maintain proper function, security and availability of our information systems could interrupt our operations, damage our reputation, subject us to liability claims or regulatory penalties and could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
8,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2014-02-14,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this document, readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.  Any of these risks or the occurrence of any one or more of the uncertainties described below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and the performance of its business.  The Company refers to itself as ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry RisksWe face risks associated with local real estate conditions in areas where we own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and local real estate conditions.  For example, an oversupply of industrial properties in a local area or a decline in the attractiveness of our properties to tenants would have a negative effect on us.  Other factors that may affect general economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:•population and demographic trends;•employment and personal income trends;•income and other tax laws;•changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;•increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and real estate taxes, due to inflation and other factors which may not necessarily be offset by increased rents; and•construction costs.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to 5modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on similar terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also develop some properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and distributions to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under mid-term and long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.6Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties.  Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities.  The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events.Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our mortgages will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including 7(i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense.  At December 31, 2013, we had $89.0 million of variable rate debt outstanding not protected by interest rate hedge contracts. We may incur additional variable rate debt in the future. If interest rates increase, then so would the interest expense on our unhedged variable rate debt, which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  From time to time, we manage our exposure to interest rate risk with interest rate hedge contracts that effectively fix or cap a portion of our variable rate debt.  In addition, we refinance fixed rate debt at times when we believe rates and terms are appropriate.  Our efforts to manage these exposures may not be successful. Our use of interest rate hedge contracts to manage risk associated with interest rate volatility may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedge contract may fail to honor its obligations.  Developing an effective interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations.  There can be no assurance that our hedging activities will have the desired beneficial impact on our results of operations or financial condition.  Termination of interest rate hedge contracts typically involves costs, such as transaction fees or breakage costs.A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, our Board of Directors may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and current and future cash dividends and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock is influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The state of the economy or other adverse changes in general or local economic conditions may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, an adverse economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of an adverse economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.8We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service.  Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification.  Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.

A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes.

(defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver.  The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control.  Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting.  We also require advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or the proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that

and•construction costs.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that constrains our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future 4legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on similar terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also develop some properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and distributions to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:•the availability of favorable financing alternatives;•the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;•construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;•construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;•expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;•fluctuations of occupancy and rental rates at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and•complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:•when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;•acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;•the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;•acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;•we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and•we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.5Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona, California and North Carolina.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties.  Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities.  The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events.Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our mortgages will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings 6and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total market capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Adverse changes in our credit ratings could impair our ability to obtain additional debt and equity financing on favorable terms, if at all.  Our credit ratings are based on our operating performance, liquidity and leverage ratios, overall financial position and other factors employed by the credit rating agencies in their rating analysis of us.  Our credit ratings can affect the amount and type of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financings we may obtain.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings.  In the event our current credit ratings deteriorate, it may be more difficult or expensive to obtain additional financing or refinance existing obligations and commitments.  Also, a downgrade in our credit ratings would trigger additional costs or other potentially negative consequences under our current and future credit facilities and debt instruments.Fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our operations and value of our stock.  As of December 31, 2012, we had approximately $76.2 million of variable interest rate debt.  As of December 31, 2012, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was 1.12%.  We may incur additional indebtedness in the future that bears interest at a variable rate or we may be required to refinance our existing debt at higher rates.  Accordingly, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to pay expected distributions to stockholders and the value of our stock.A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, our Board of Directors may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and current and future cash dividends and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock is influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The current economic situation may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.  Turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of the current economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service.  Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification.  Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits.  Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  To 7qualify as a REIT, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements.  We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are few judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.  Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted.  Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.  From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.Our Charter contains provisions that may adversely affect the value of EastGroup stock.  Our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver.  The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control.  Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting.  We also require advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or the proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders.The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.Our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval.  Under our Charter, the Board has the power to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital stock with such preferences, rights, powers and restrictions as the Board of Directors may determine.  The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' best interests.Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.  Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations.  The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely because of the effect of the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Maryland law the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director.  Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law.8The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an ""interested stockholder"" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met.  An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares"" of a corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power:  one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power.  A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders' meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights"

current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our operations and value of our stock.  As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $154.5 million of variable interest rate debt.  As of December 31, 2011, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was 1.15%.  We may incur additional indebtedness in the future that bears interest at a variable rate or we may be required to refinance our existing debt at higher rates.  Accordingly, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to pay expected distributions to stockholders and the value of our stock.A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, our Board of Directors may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.-6-     Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and current and future cash dividends and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock is influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The current economic situation may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The continuation or intensification of the turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of the current economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT. If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we will not be allowed to deduct distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and will be subject to federal income tax, including any applicable alternative minimum tax, at regular corporate rates.  In addition, we may be barred from qualification as a REIT for the four years following disqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular corporate rates would significantly reduce the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders and for debt service.  Furthermore, we would no longer be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to our stockholders as a condition of REIT qualification.  Any distributions to stockholders would be taxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although such dividend distributions would be subject to a top federal tax rate of 15% through 2012.  Corporate distributees, however, may be eligible for the dividends received deduction on the distributions, subject to limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.  To qualify as a REIT, we must comply with certain highly technical and complex requirements.  We cannot be certain we have complied with these requirements because there are few judicial and administrative interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our control may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot assure you that new legislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws significantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification.  We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.There is a risk of changes in the tax law applicable to real estate investment trusts.  Since the Internal Revenue Service, the United States Treasury Department and Congress frequently review federal income tax legislation, we cannot predict whether, when or to what extent new federal tax laws, regulations, interpretations or rulings will be adopted.  Any such legislative action may prospectively or retroactively modify our tax treatment and, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.We face possible adverse changes in tax laws.  From time to time, changes in state and local tax laws or regulations are enacted which may result in an increase in our tax liability. A shortfall in tax revenues for states and municipalities in which we operate may lead to an increase in the frequency and size of such changes. If such changes occur, we may be required to pay additional taxes on our assets or income. These increased tax costs could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and the amount of cash available for the payment of dividends.Our Charter contains provisions that may adversely affect the value of EastGroup stock.  Our charter prohibits any holder from acquiring more than 9.8% (in value or in number, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, except our excess stock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grants a waiver.  The ownership limit may limit the opportunity for stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% of the outstanding shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control.  Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of our common stock is necessary for stockholders to call a special meeting.  We also require advance notice by stockholders for the nomination of directors or the proposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders. -7-     The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many of our senior executives have strong industry reputations, which aid us in identifying acquisition and development opportunities and negotiating with tenants and sellers of properties.  The loss of the services of these key personnel could affect our operations because of diminished relationships with existing and prospective tenants, property sellers and industry personnel.  In addition, attracting new or replacement personnel may be difficult in a competitive market. We have severance and change in control agreements with certain of our officers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer’s agreement) following a change in control, we terminate the officer's employment other than for cause, or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment with us for reasons specified in the agreement, we will make a severance payment equal to the officer's average annual compensation times an amount specified in the officer's agreement, together with the officer's base salary and vacation pay that have accrued but are unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a change in control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control of us.Our Board of Directors may authorize and issue securities without stockholder approval.  Under our Charter, the Board has the power to classify and reclassify any of our unissued shares of capital stock into shares of capital stock with such preferences, rights, powers and restrictions as the Board of Directors may determine.  The authorization and issuance of a new class of capital stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing someone from taking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' best interests.Maryland business statutes may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of us.  Maryland law provides protection for Maryland corporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting, among other things, the duties of the directors in unsolicited takeover situations.  The duties of directors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept, recommend or respond to any proposal by a person seeking to acquire control of the corporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modify or render inapplicable, any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determination under the Maryland Business Combination Act or the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely because of the effect of the act or failure to act may have on an acquisition or potential acquisition of control of the corporation or the amount or type of consideration that may be offered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Maryland law the act of a director of a Maryland corporation relating to or affecting an acquisition or potential acquisition of control is not subject to any higher duty or greater scrutiny than is applied to any other act of a director.  Maryland law also contains a statutory presumption that an act of a director of a Maryland corporation satisfies the applicable standards of conduct for directors under Maryland law.The Maryland Business Combination Act provides that unless exempted, a Maryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers, dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares of stock and other specified transactions, with an ""interested stockholder"" or an affiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder became an interested stockholder, and thereafter unless specified criteria are met.  An interested stockholder is generally a person owning or controlling, directly or indirectly, 10 percent or more of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.The Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares"" of a corporation acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no voting rights except to the extent approved by a vote of two-thirds of the votes eligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock previously acquired by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within one of the following ranges of the voting power:  one-tenth or more but less than one-third, one-third or more but less than a majority, or a majority or more of all voting power.  A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of control shares, subject to certain exceptions.If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share acquisition are not approved at a stockholders' meeting, then subject to certain conditions and limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fair value.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitled to vote a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights"

and·  construction costs.We may be unable to compete for properties and tenants.  The real estate business is highly competitive.  We compete for interests in properties with other real estate investors and purchasers, some of whom have greater financial resources, revenues, and geographical diversity than we have.  Furthermore, we compete for tenants with other property owners.  All of our industrial properties are subject to significant local competition.  We also compete with a wide variety of institutions and other investors for capital funds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.We are subject to significant regulation that inhibits our activities.  Local zoning and land use laws, environmental statutes and other governmental requirements restrict our expansion, rehabilitation and reconstruction activities.  These regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economic opportunities.  Legislation such as the Americans with Disabilities Act may require us to modify our properties, and noncompliance could result in the imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  Future legislation may impose additional requirements.  We cannot predict what requirements may be enacted or what changes may be implemented to existing legislation.Risks Associated with Our PropertiesWe may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires, a tenant may elect not to renew it.  We may not be able to re-lease the property on similar terms, if we are able to re-lease the property at all.  The terms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required renovations and/or concessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also develop some properties with no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial portion of our properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lower than expected rates, our cash generated before debt repayments and capital expenditures and our ability to make expected distributions to stockholders may be adversely affected.   4  We have been and may continue to be affected negatively by tenant bankruptcies and leasing delays.  At any time, a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition.  Similarly, a general decline in the economy may result in a decline in the demand for space at our industrial properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease commencement, fail to make rental payments when due, or declare bankruptcy.  Any such event could result in the termination of that tenant’s lease and losses to us, and distributions to investors may decrease.  We receive a substantial portion of our income as rents under long-term leases.  If tenants are unable to comply with the terms of their leases because of rising costs or falling sales, we may deem it advisable to modify lease terms to allow tenants to pay a lower rent or a smaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs.  If a tenant becomes insolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee or debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcy proceeding relating to the tenant.  We also cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the proceeding sufficient to cover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes bankrupt, the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances, may restrict the amount and recoverability of our claims against the tenant.  A tenant’s default on its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash we have available for distribution.We face risks associated with our property development.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditions warrant such investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results in accordance with our expectations.  Risks associated with our current and future development and construction activities include:·  the availability of favorable financing alternatives;·  the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or that due to the increased cost of land, our activities may not be as profitable;·  construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;·  construction and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service, fixed expenses and construction costs;·  expenditure of funds and devotion of management's time to projects that we do not complete;·  fluctuations of occupancy rates and rents at newly completed properties, which depend on a number of factors, including market and economic conditions, resulting in lower than projected rental rates and a corresponding lower return on our investment; and·  complications (including building moratoriums and anti-growth legislation) in obtaining necessary zoning, occupancy and other governmental permits.We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individual properties and portfolios of properties and intend to continue to do so.  Our acquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:·  when we are able to locate a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;·  acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;·  the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than our estimates;·  acquired properties may be located in new markets where we face risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures;·  we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and as a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and·  we may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, to the transferor with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a claim were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.Coverage under our existing insurance policies may be inadequate to cover losses.  We generally maintain insurance policies related to our business, including casualty, general liability and other policies, covering our business operations, employees and assets as appropriate for the markets where our properties and business operations are located.  However, we would be required to bear all losses that are not adequately covered by insurance.  In addition, there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not generally fully insured against because it is not deemed economically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind, earthquakes, acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots.  If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of our properties, then we could lose the capital we invested in the properties, as well as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.We face risks due to lack of geographic and real estate sector diversity.  Substantially all of our properties are located in the Sunbelt region of the United States with an emphasis in the states of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California.  A downturn in general economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographic regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduced demand for industrial properties, local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics, would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.  Our investments in real estate assets are concentrated in the industrial distribution sector.  This concentration may expose us to the risk of economic downturns in this sector to a greater extent than if our business activities included other sectors of the real estate industry.   5  We face risks due to the illiquidity of real estate which may limit our ability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.  Our ability to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions will therefore be limited.  In addition, because of our status as a REIT, the Internal Revenue Code limits our ability to sell our properties.  If we must sell an investment, we cannot ensure that we will be able to dispose of the investment on terms favorable to the Company.We are subject to environmental laws and regulations.  Current and previous real estate owners and operators may be required under various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations to investigate and clean up hazardous substances released at the properties they own or operate.  They may also be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or natural resource damage, investigation costs and cleanup costs.  Such laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of such hazardous substances.  In addition, some environmental laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs the government incurs in connection with the contamination.  Contamination may adversely affect the owner’s ability to use, sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liability to which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on a previous owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substances were disposed of, released from, or present at the property.  A conveyance of the property, therefore, may not relieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conducted at our properties to identify potential sources of contamination at the properties, such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or compliance concerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware, that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Compliance with new laws or regulations related to climate change, including compliance with “green” building codes, may require us to make improvements to our existing properties.  Proposed legislation could also increase the costs of energy and utilities.  The cost of the proposed legislation may adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.  We may be adversely affected by floods, hurricanes and other climate related events.Financing RisksWe face risks associated with the use of debt to fund acquisitions and developments, including refinancing risk.  We are subject to the risks normally associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  In addition, certain of our mortgages will have significant outstanding principal balances on their maturity dates, commonly known as “balloon payments.”  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures.  There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that the terms of any refinancing will not be as favorable as the terms of the existing debt.We face risks associated with our dependence on external sources of capital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our ordinary taxable income, and we are subject to tax on our income to the extent it is not distributed.  Because of this distribution requirement, we may not be able to fund all future capital needs from cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we rely on third-party sources of capital, which we may not be able to obtain on favorable terms, if at all.  Our access to third-party sources of capital depends upon a number of factors, including (i) general market conditions; (ii) the market’s perception of our growth potential; (iii) our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capital stock.  Additional debt financing may substantially increase our debt-to-total capitalization ratio.  Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of our current stockholders.Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.  The terms of our various credit agreements and other indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial and other covenants, such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage.  These covenants may limit our flexibility in our operations, and breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unable to refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment obligations, the amount of our distributable cash flow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.Fluctuations in interest rates may adversely affect our operations and value of our stock.  As of December 31, 2010, we had approximately $91 million of variable interest rate debt.  As of December 31, 2010, the weighted average interest rate on our variable rate debt was 1.12%.  We may incur additional indebtedness in the future that bears interest at a variable rate or we may be required to refinance our existing debt at higher rates.  Accordingly, increases in interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability to pay expected distributions to stockholders and the value of our stock.A lack of any limitation on our debt could result in our becoming more highly leveraged.  Our governing documents do not limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur.  Accordingly, our Board of Directors may incur additional debt and would do so, for example, if it were necessary to maintain our status as a REIT.  We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and our financial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might be negatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.   6  Other RisksThe market value of our common stock could decrease based on our performance and market perception and conditions.  The market value of our common stock may be based primarily upon the market’s perception of our growth potential and current and future cash dividends and may be secondarily based upon the real estate market value of our underlying assets.  The market price of our common stock is influenced by the dividend on our common stock relative to market interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential buyers of our common stock to expect a higher dividend rate, which would adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  In addition, rising interest rates would result in increased expense, thereby adversely affecting cash flow and our ability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.The current economic situation may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. The continuation or intensification of the turmoil in the global financial markets may have an adverse impact on the availability of credit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S. and global economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our ability to access credit markets and finance our operations.  However, our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like, or need, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions.  Furthermore, deteriorating economic conditions including business layoffs, downsizing, industry slowdowns and other similar factors that affect our customers could continue to negatively impact commercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy, lower rental rates and declining values in our real estate portfolio and in the collateral securing any loan investments we may make.  Additionally, the economic situation could have an impact on our lenders or customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us.  No assurances can be given that the effects of the current economic situation will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may fail to qualify as a REIT.

In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by referencein this document,  readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.Any of these  risks or the  occurrence  of any one or more of the  uncertaintiesdescribed below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's  financialcondition and the  performance of its business.  The Company refers to itself as""we"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry Risks     We face risks  associated with local real estate  conditions in areas wherewe own properties.  We may be adversely affected by general economic  conditionsand local real estate  conditions.  For example,  an  oversupply  of  industrialproperties in a local area or a decline in the  attractiveness of our propertiesto tenants  would have a negative  effect on us.  Other  factors that may affectgeneral economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:     o    population and demographic trends;     o    employment and personal income trends;     o    income tax laws;     o    changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;     o    increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and          real estate  taxes,  due to inflation  and other factors which may not          necessarily be offset by increased rents; and     o    construction costs.     We may  be  unable  to  compete  with  our  larger  competitors  and  otheralternatives  available to tenants or potential  tenants of our properties.  Thereal  estate  business  is highly  competitive.  We  compete  for  interests  inproperties with other real estate  investors and  purchasers,  many of whom havegreater financial resources,  revenues, and geographical diversity than we have.Furthermore,  we compete  for tenants  with other  property  owners.  All of ourindustrial  properties are subject to  significant  local  competition.  We alsocompete  with a wide variety of  institutions  and other  investors  for capitalfunds necessary to support our investment activities and asset growth.     We are subject to  significant  regulation  that  inhibits our  activities.Local zoning and land use laws,  environmental  statutes and other  governmentalrequirements   restrict  our  expansion,   rehabilitation   and   reconstructionactivities.  These  regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economicopportunities.  Legislation  such as the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act mayrequire  us to modify  our  properties  and  noncompliance  could  result in theimposition  of fines  or an  award  of  damages  to  private  litigants.  Futurelegislation  may  impose  additional   requirements.   We  cannot  predict  whatrequirements  may be enacted or what  changes  may be  implemented  to  existinglegislation.Risks Associated with Our Properties     We may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires,  a tenant may electnot to renew it. We may not be able to re-lease the  property on similar  terms,if we are able to re-lease the property at all. The terms of renewal or re-lease(including the cost of required  renovations  and/or concessions to tenants) maybe less  favorable to us than the prior lease.  We also develop some  propertieswith no pre-leasing.  If we are unable to lease all or a substantial  portion ofour properties, or if the rental rates upon such leasing are significantly lowerthan expected  rates,  our cash  generated  before debt  repayments  and capitalexpenditures,  and our ability to make expected  distributions  to stockholders,may be adversely affected.     We  have  been  and  may  continue  to be  affected  negatively  by  tenantbankruptcies and leasing delays. At any time, a tenant may experience a downturnin its business that may weaken its financial  condition.  Similarly,  a generaldecline  in the  economy  may result in a decline in the demand for space at ourindustrial  properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease  commencement,fail to make rental  payments  when due, or declare  bankruptcy.  Any such eventcould result in the  termination  of that  tenant's  lease and losses to us, anddistributions to investors may decrease. We receive a substantial portion of ourincome as rents under long-term leases. If tenants are unable to comply with theterms of their leases because of rising costs or falling  sales,  we may deem itadvisable  to  modify  lease  terms to allow  tenants  to pay a lower  rent or asmaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs. If a tenant becomesinsolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises fromthe tenant promptly or from a trustee or  debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcyproceeding  relating to the tenant. We also cannot be sure that we would receiverent in the  proceeding  sufficient  to cover our  expenses                                       3with  respect  to the  premises.  If a  tenant  becomes  bankrupt,  the  federalbankruptcy code will apply and, in some  instances,  may restrict the amount andrecoverability  of our claims  against  the  tenant.  A tenant's  default on itsobligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash wehave available for distribution.     We face  risks  associated  with our  property  development.  We  intend tocontinue to develop  properties where market conditions warrant such investment.Once made,  our  investments  may not  produce  results in  accordance  with ourexpectations.  Risks  associated  with our  current and future  development  andconstruction activities include:     o    the availability of favorable financing alternatives;     o    the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or          that due to the increased  cost of land,  our activities may not be as          profitable, especially in certain land constrained areas;     o    construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest          rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;     o    construction  and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service,          fixed expenses and construction costs;     o    expenditure  of funds and  devotion of  management's  time to projects          that we do not complete;     o    occupancy rates and rents at newly completed  properties may fluctuate          depending  on a number  of  factors,  including  market  and  economic          conditions,  resulting  in lower  than  projected  rental  rates and a          corresponding lower return on our investment; and     o    complications   (including   building   moratoriums   and  anti-growth          legislation)  in  obtaining  necessary  zoning,  occupancy  and  other          governmental permits.     We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individualproperties and  portfolios of  properties,  and intend to continue to do so. Ouracquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:     o    when we are able to locate a desired property,  competition from other          real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;     o    acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;     o    the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping  acquired properties          may be higher than our estimates;     o    acquired  properties may be located in new markets where we face risks          associated with an incomplete  knowledge or understanding of the local          market, a limited number of established business  relationships in the          area  and  a  relative   unfamiliarity  with  local  governmental  and          permitting procedures;     o    we  may  be  unable  to  quickly   and   efficiently   integrate   new          acquisitions,  particularly  acquisitions of portfolios of properties,          into  our  existing  operations,  and  as a  result,  our  results  of          operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and     o    we may  acquire  properties  subject to  liabilities  and  without any          recourse,  or with  only  limited  recourse,  to the  transferor  with          respect to unknown liabilities.  As a result, if a claim were asserted          against us based upon ownership of those properties,  we might have to          pay substantial  sums to settle it, which could  adversely  affect our          cash flow.     Coverage under our existing  insurance  policies may be inadequate to coverlosses.  We  generally  maintain  insurance  policies  related to our  business,including casualty, general liability and other policies,  covering our businessoperations,  employees and assets as  appropriate  for the markets where each ofour  properties  and  business  operations  are  located.  However,  we would berequired to bear all losses that are not  adequately  covered by  insurance.  Inaddition,  there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against orthat  are  not  generally  fully  insured  against  because  it  is  not  deemedeconomically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind,earthquakes,  acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots. If an uninsured loss or aloss in excess of  insured  limits  occurs  with  respect  to one or more of ourproperties,  then we could lose the capital we invested  in the  properties,  aswell as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if thedamaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to beliable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.     We face risks due to lack of geographic  and real estate sector  diversity.Substantially  all of our  properties  are located in the Sunbelt  region of theUnited  States with an emphasis  in the states of  Florida,  Texas,  Arizona andCalifornia.  A downturn  in general  economic  conditions  and local real estateconditions in these geographic  regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduceddemand for industrial properties,  local business climate,  business layoffs andchanging  demographics,  would have a particularly  strong adverse effect on us.Our  investments  in real  estate  assets  are  concentrated  in the  industrialdistribution  sector.  This  concentration may expose us to the risk of economicdownturns  in this sector to a greater  extent than if our  business  activitiesincluded  a more  significant  portion  of  other  sectors  of the  real  estateindustry.     We face risks due to the  illiquidity  of real  estate  which may limit ourability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.Our ability to vary our  portfolio  in response to changes in economic and otherconditions  will therefore be limited.  In addition,  the Internal  Revenue Codelimits our ability to sell our  properties.  If we must sell an  investment,  wecannot  ensure  that  we will be able to  dispose  of the  investment  at  termsfavorable to the Company.     We face  possible  environmental  liabilities.  Current and  previous  realestate  owners and operators may be required  under various  federal,  state andlocal laws,  ordinances and  regulations  to investigate  and clean up hazardoussubstances  released at the  properties  they own or  operate.  They may also beliable to the government or to third parties for substantial property or naturalresource damage,  investigation  costs and cleanup costs. Such laws often imposeliability  without  regard  to  whether  the owner or  operator  knew of, or was                                       4responsible  for,  the  release or  presence of such  hazardous  substances.  Inaddition,  some  environmental  laws create a lien on the  contaminated  site infavor  of the  government  for  damages  and  costs  the  government  incurs  inconnection  with the  contamination.  Contamination  may  adversely  affect  theowner's  ability to use,  sell or lease real estate or to borrow  using the realestate as  collateral.  We have no way of determining at this time the magnitudeof  any  potential  liability  to  which  we  may  be  subject  arising  out  ofenvironmental  conditions  or  violations  with  respect  to the  properties  wecurrently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on aprevious  owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property ata time when hazardous or toxic  substances  were disposed of,  released from, orpresent at, the  property.  A conveyance  of the  property,  therefore,  may notrelieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conductedat  our  properties  to  identify  potential  sources  of  contamination  at theproperties,  such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or complianceconcerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmentalliabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware,that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets orresults of operations.Financing Risks     We face  risks  associated  with the use of debt to fund  acquisitions  anddevelopments,  including  refinancing risk. We are subject to the risks normallyassociated  with debt  financing,  including the risk that our cash flow will beinsufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  We anticipatethat a  portion  of the  principal  of our  debt  will  not be  repaid  prior tomaturity.  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of ouroutstanding  debt  as it  matures.  There  is a risk  that we may not be able torefinance  existing  debt or that the  terms of any  refinancing  will not be asfavorable as the terms of the existing debt.     We face risks related to ""balloon  payments."" Certain of our mortgages willhave  significant  outstanding  principal  balances  on  their  maturity  dates,commonly known as ""balloon  payments."" There can be no assurance whether we willbe able to refinance such balloon  payments on the maturity of the loans,  whichmay  force  disposition  of  properties  on  disadvantageous  terms  or  requirereplacement with debt with higher interest rates,  either of which would have anadverse  impact on our  financial  performance  and ability to pay  dividends toinvestors.     We face  risks  associated  with our  dependence  on  external  sources  ofcapital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distributeto our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,  and we are subjectto tax on our  income  to the  extent  it is not  distributed.  Because  of thisdistribution  requirement,  we may not be able to fund all future  capital needsfrom cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we relyon  third-party  sources  of  capital,  which  we may not be able to  obtain  onfavorable terms, if at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital dependsupon a number of factors,  including  (i) general  market  conditions;  (ii) themarket's  perception  of our growth  potential;  (iii) our current and potentialfuture earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capitalstock.  Additional debt financing may  substantially  increase our debt-to-totalcapitalization ratio. Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of ourcurrent stockholders.     Covenants  in  our  credit  agreements  could  limit  our  flexibility  andadversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  The terms of our  various  creditagreements  and  other  indebtedness  require  us to  comply  with a  number  ofcustomary  financial  and other  covenants,  such as  maintaining  debt  servicecoverage and leverage ratios and maintaining insurance coverage. These covenantsmay limit our  flexibility in our  operations,  and breaches of these  covenantscould  result  in  defaults  under  the  instruments  governing  the  applicableindebtedness even if we had satisfied our payment obligations.  If we are unableto refinance our indebtedness at maturity or meet our payment  obligations,  theamount of our  distributable  cash  flow and our  financial  condition  would beadversely affected.     Fluctuations  in interest  rates may adversely  affect our  operations  andvalue of our stock. As of December 31, 2008, we had  approximately  $110 millionof variable  interest rate debt. As of December 31, 2008,  the weighted  averageinterest  rate on our  variable  rate debt was  1.23%.  We may incur  additionalindebtedness  in the future that bears  interest at a variable rate or we may berequired to refinance our existing debt at higher rates. Accordingly,  increasesin interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability topay expected distributions to stockholders and the value of our stock.     A lack of any  limitation  on our debt could  result in our  becoming  morehighly  leveraged.   Our  governing   documents  do  not  limit  the  amount  ofindebtedness  we may  incur.  Accordingly,  our  Board of  Directors  may  incuradditional  debt and would do so, for example,  if it were necessary to maintainour status as a REIT. We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and ourfinancial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might benegatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other Risks     The  market  value  of  our  common  stock  could  decrease  based  on  ourperformance and market perception and conditions. The market value of our commonstock  may be  based  primarily  upon  the  market's  perception  of our  growthpotential and current and future cash  dividends,  and may be secondarily  basedupon the real estate market value of our underlying  assets. The market price ofour common stock is influenced  by the dividend on our common stock  relative tomarket  interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential  buyers of ourcommon stock to expect a higher dividend rate,  which would adversely affect themarket price of our common  stock.  In  addition,  rising  interest  rates wouldresult in  increased  expense,  thereby  adversely  affecting  cash flow and ourability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.                                       5     The recent market  disruptions may adversely  affect our operating  resultsand financial  condition.  The continuation or intensification of the turmoil inthe global  financial  markets may have an adverse impact on the availability ofcredit to businesses generally and could lead to a further weakening of the U.S.and global  economies.  Currently these conditions have not impaired our abilityto access credit  markets and finance our  operations.  However,  our ability toaccess the capital  markets may be  restricted  at a time when we would like, orneed, to raise financing, which could have an impact on our flexibility to reactto  changing  economic  and  business  conditions.  Furthermore,   deterioratingeconomic conditions including business layoffs,  downsizing,  industry slowdownsand other similar  factors that affect our  customers  could  negatively  impactcommercial real estate fundamentals and result in lower occupancy,  lower rentalrates and declining  values in our real estate  portfolio and in the  collateralsecuring any loan investments we may make. Additionally,  the economic situationcould have an impact on our lenders or  customers,  causing them to fail to meettheir  obligations  to us. No  assurances  can be given that the  effects of thecurrent  crisis  will  not  have a  material  adverse  effect  on our  business,financial condition and results of operations.     We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we willnot be allowed to deduct  distributions to stockholders in computing our taxableincome and will be  subject to federal  income  tax,  including  any  applicablealternative  minimum tax, at regular  corporate  rates.  In addition,  we may bebarred   from   qualification   as  a  REIT   for  the  four   years   followingdisqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular  corporate rates wouldsignificantly  reduce the cash flow available for  distribution  to stockholdersand for debt  service.  Furthermore,  we  would no  longer  be  required  by theInternal  Revenue  Code to  make  any  distributions  to our  stockholders  as acondition of REIT  qualification.  Any  distributions  to stockholders  would betaxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earningsand profits,  although  such  dividend  distributions  would be subject to a topfederal tax rate of 15% through 2010.  Corporate  distributees,  however, may beeligible for the dividends received  deduction on the distributions,  subject tolimitations  under the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  To qualify as a REIT,  we mustcomply with certain  highly  technical  and complex  requirements.  We cannot becertain we have complied with these requirements  because there are few judicialand administrative  interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts andcircumstances  that may be beyond our  control may affect our ability to qualifyas  a  REIT.   We  cannot   assure  you  that  new   legislation,   regulations,administrative  interpretations  or court decisions will not change the tax lawssignificantly with respect to our qualification as a REIT or with respect to thefederal income tax consequences of  qualification.  We cannot assure you that wewill remain qualified as a REIT.     There  is a risk  of  changes  in the  tax law  applicable  to real  estateinvestment  trusts.  Since the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  the  United  StatesTreasury   Department  and  Congress   frequently   review  federal  income  taxlegislation,  we cannot predict whether,  when or to what extent new federal taxlaws,  regulations,  interpretations  or rulings  will be  adopted.  Any of suchlegislative  action may prospectively or retroactively  modify our tax treatmentand, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.     Our Charter  contains  provisions  that may  adversely  affect the value ofshareholders'  stock. Our charter  prohibits any holder from acquiring more than9.8% (in value or in number,  whichever is more  restrictive) of our outstandingequity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock,  except our excessstock (of which there is none outstanding)) unless our Board of Directors grantsa waiver.  The ownership  limit may limit the  opportunity  for  stockholders toreceive a premium for their shares of common stock that might otherwise exist ifan investor  were  attempting to assemble a block of shares in excess of 9.8% ofthe outstanding  shares of equity stock or otherwise effect a change in control.Also,  the request of the  holders of a majority or more of our common  stock isnecessary for  stockholders to call a special  meeting.  We also require advancenotice by  stockholders  for the  nomination  of  directors  or the  proposal ofbusiness to be considered at a meeting of stockholders.     The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many ofour  senior  executives  have  strong  industry  reputations,  which  aid  us inidentifying  acquisition and  development  opportunities  and  negotiating  withtenants  and  sellers  of  properties.  The loss of the  services  of these  keypersonnel could affect our operations  because of diminished  relationships withexisting and prospective  tenants,  property sellers and industry personnel.  Inaddition,  attracting  new  or  replacement  personnel  may  be  difficult  in acompetitive market.     We have  severance  and change in control  agreements  with  certain of ourofficers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certaintime period (as set in the officer's  agreement)  following a change in control,we terminate the officer's  employment  other than for cause,  or if the officerelects to terminate his or her employment  with us for reasons  specified in theagreement,  we will make a  severance  payment  equal to the  officer's  averageannual  compensation  times an  amount  specified  in the  officer's  agreement,together with the  officer's  base salary and vacation pay that have accrued butare unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a changein control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control ofus.     Our  Board  of  Directors  may  authorize  and  issue  securities   withoutstockholder approval. Under our Charter, the Board has the power to classify andreclassify  any of our unissued  shares of capital  stock into shares of capitalstock with such  preferences,  rights,  powers and  restrictions as the Board ofDirectors  may  determine.  The  authorization  and  issuance  of a new class ofcapital  stock  could have the effect of  delaying or  preventing  someone  fromtaking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' bestinterests.     Maryland  business  statutes  may limit  the  ability  of a third  party toacquire   control  of  us.   Maryland  law  provides   protection  for  Marylandcorporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting,  among other things, theduties of the  directors  in  unsolicited  takeover  situations.  The  duties ofdirectors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept,  recommendor  respond  to any  proposal  by a person  seeking  to  acquire  control of thecorporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modifyor render  inapplicable,  any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determinationunder the  Maryland  Business  Combination  Act or the  Maryland  Control  ShareAcquisition  Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely  because of the effect of theact or failure to act may have on an  acquisition  or potential  acquisition  ofcontrol of the  corporation or the amount or type of  consideration  that may beoffered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Marylandlaw the act of a director of a Maryland  corporation relating to or affecting anacquisition  or  potential  acquisition  of control is not subject to any higherduty or  greater  scrutiny  than is  applied  to any  other  act of a  director.Maryland law also contains a statutory  presumption that an act of a director ofa Maryland  corporation  satisfies  the  applicable  standards  of  conduct  fordirectors under Maryland law.                                       6     The Maryland  Business  Combination  Act provides that unless  exempted,  aMaryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers,dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares ofstock and other specified transactions,  with an ""interested  stockholder"" or anaffiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent dateon which the  interested  stockholder  became  an  interested  stockholder,  andthereafter  unless  specified  criteria are met. An  interested  stockholder  isgenerally a person owning or controlling,  directly or indirectly, 10 percent ormore of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.     The Maryland  Control Share  Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares""of a corporation  acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no votingrights  except  to the  extent  approved  by a vote of  two-thirds  of the voteseligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, ifaggregated with all other shares of stock  previously  acquired by the acquirer,would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors withinone of the following ranges of the voting power: one-tenth or more but less thanone-third,  one-third  or more but less than a majority or a majority or more ofall voting power. A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of controlshares, subject to certain exceptions.     If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share  acquisitionare not approved at a stockholders'  meeting, then subject to certain conditionsand limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fairvalue.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a  stockholders'meeting and the  acquirer  becomes  entitled to vote a majority of the shares ofstock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights"
17,EGP,EASTGROUP PROPERTIES,2008-02-28,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS.     In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by referencein this document,  readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.Any of these  risks or the  occurrence  of any one or more of the  uncertaintiesdescribed below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's  financialcondition and the  performance of its business.  The Company refers to itself as""we"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry Risks     We face risks  associated with local real estate  conditions in areas wherewe own properties.  We may be affected adversely by general economic  conditionsand local real estate  conditions.  For example,  an  oversupply  of  industrialproperties in a local area or a decline in the  attractiveness of our propertiesto tenants  would have a negative  effect on us.  Other  factors that may affectgeneral economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:     o    population and demographic trends;     o    employment and personal income trends;     o    income tax laws;     o    changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;     o    increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and          real estate  taxes,  due to inflation  and other factors which may not          necessarily be offset by increased rents; and     o    construction costs.     We may  be  unable  to  compete  with  our  larger  competitors  and  otheralternatives  available to tenants or potential  tenants of our properties.  Thereal  estate  business  is highly  competitive.  We  compete  for  interests  inproperties with other real estate  investors and  purchasers,  many of whom havegreater financial resources,  revenues, and geographical diversity than we have.Furthermore,  we compete  for tenants  with other  property  owners.  All of ourindustrial  properties are subject to  significant  local  competition.  We alsocompete  with a wide variety of  institutions  and other  investors  for capitalfunds  necessary  to support our  investment  activities  and asset  growth.     We are subject to  significant  regulation  that  inhibits our  activities.Local zoning and land use laws,  environmental  statutes and other  governmentalrequirements   restrict  our  expansion,   rehabilitation   and   reconstructionactivities.  These  regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economicopportunities.  Legislation  such as the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act mayrequire  us to modify  our  properties  and  noncompliance  could  result in theimposition  of fines  or an  award  of  damages  to  private  litigants.  Futurelegislation  may  impose  additional   requirements.   We  cannot  predict  whatrequirements  may be enacted or what  changes  may be  implemented  to  existinglegislation.Risks Associated with Our Properties     We may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires,  a tenant may electnot to renew it. We may not be able to re-lease the  property on similar  terms,if we are able to re-lease the property at all. The terms of renewal or re-lease(including the cost of required  renovations  and/or concessions to tenants) maybe less favorable to us than the prior lease. We also develop properties with nopre-leasing.  If we are  unable to lease  all or a  substantial  portion  of ourproperties,  or if the rental  rates upon such leasing are  significantly  lowerthan expected  rates,  our cash  generated  before debt  repayments  and capitalexpenditures,  and our ability to make expected  distributions  to stockholders,may be adversely affected.     We  have  been  and  may  continue  to be  affected  negatively  by  tenantbankruptcies and leasing delays. At any time, a tenant may experience a downturnin its business that may weaken its financial  condition.  Similarly,  a generaldecline  in the  economy  may result in a decline in the demand for space at ourindustrial  properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease  commencement,fail to make rental  payments  when due, or declare  bankruptcy.  Any such eventcould result in the  termination  of that  tenant's  lease and losses to us, anddistributions to investors may decrease. We receive a substantial portion of ourincome as rents under long-term leases. If tenants are unable to comply with theterms of their leases because of rising costs or falling  sales,  we may deem itadvisable  to  modify  lease  terms to allow  tenants  to pay a lower  rent or asmaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs. If a tenant becomesinsolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises fromthe tenant promptly or from a trustee or  debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcyproceeding  relating to the tenant. We also cannot be sure that we would receiverent in the  proceeding  sufficient  to cover our  expenses                                       3with  respect  to the  premises.  If a  tenant  becomes  bankrupt,  the  federalbankruptcy code will apply and, in some  instances,  may restrict the amount andrecoverability  of our claims  against  the  tenant.  A tenant's  default on itsobligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash wehave available for distribution.     We face  risks  associated  with our  property  development.  We  intend tocontinue to develop  properties where market conditions warrant such investment.Once made,  our  investments  may not  produce  results in  accordance  with ourexpectations.  Risks  associated  with our  current and future  development  andconstruction activities include:     o    the availability of favorable financing alternatives;     o    the risk that we may not be able to obtain land on which to develop or          that due to the increased  cost of land,  our activities may not be as          profitable, especially in certain land constrained areas;     o    construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest          rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;     o    construction  and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service,          fixed expenses and construction costs;     o    expenditure  of funds and  devotion of  management's  time to projects          that we do not complete;     o    occupancy rates and rents at newly completed  properties may fluctuate          depending  on a number  of  factors,  including  market  and  economic          conditions,  resulting  in lower  than  projected  rental  rates and a          corresponding lower return on our investment; and     o    complications   (including   building   moratoriums   and  anti-growth          legislation)  in  obtaining  necessary  zoning,  occupancy  and  other          governmental permits.     We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individualproperties and  portfolios of  properties,  and intend to continue to do so. Ouracquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:     o    when we are able to locate a desired property,  competition from other          real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;     o    acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;     o    the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping  acquired properties          may be higher than our estimates;     o    acquired  properties may be located in new markets where we face risks          associated with an incomplete  knowledge or understanding of the local          market, a limited number of established business  relationships in the          area  and  a  relative   unfamiliarity  with  local  governmental  and          permitting procedures;     o    we  may  be  unable  to  quickly   and   efficiently   integrate   new          acquisitions,  particularly  acquisitions of portfolios of properties,          into  our  existing  operations,  and  as a  result,  our  results  of          operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and     o    we may  acquire  properties  subject to  liabilities  and  without any          recourse,  or with  only  limited  recourse,  to the  transferor  with          respect to unknown liabilities.  As a result, if a claim were asserted          against us based upon ownership of those properties,  we might have to          pay substantial  sums to settle it, which could  adversely  affect our          cash flow.     Coverage under our existing  insurance  policies may be inadequate to coverlosses.  We  generally  maintain  insurance  policies  related to our  business,including casualty, general liability and other policies,  covering our businessoperations,  employees and assets as  appropriate  for the markets where each ofour  properties  and  business  operations  are  located.  However,  we would berequired to bear all losses that are not  adequately  covered by  insurance.  Inaddition,  there may be certain losses that are not generally insured against orthat  are  not  generally  fully  insured  against  because  it  is  not  deemedeconomically feasible or prudent to do so, including losses due to floods, wind,earthquakes,  acts of war, acts of terrorism or riots. If an uninsured loss or aloss in excess of  insured  limits  occurs  with  respect  to one or more of ourproperties,  then we could lose the capital we invested  in the  properties,  aswell as the anticipated future revenue from the properties.  In addition, if thedamaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness, we would continue to beliable for the indebtedness, even if these properties were irreparably damaged.     We face risks due to lack of geographic  and real estate sector  diversity.Substantially  all of our  properties  are located in the Sunbelt  region of theUnited  States with an emphasis  in the states of  Florida,  Texas,  Arizona andCalifornia.  A downturn  in general  economic  conditions  and local real estateconditions in these geographic  regions, as a result of oversupply of or reduceddemand for industrial properties,  local business climate,  business layoffs andchanging  demographics,  would have a particularly  strong adverse effect on us.Our  investments  in  real  estate  assets  are  primarily  concentrated  in theindustrial  distribution sector. This concentration may expose us to the risk ofeconomic  downturns  in this  sector to a greater  extent  than if our  businessactivities  included a more  significant  portion  of other  sectors of the realestate industry.     We face risks due to the  illiquidity  of real  estate  which may limit ourability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.Our ability to vary our  portfolio  in response to changes in economic and otherconditions  will therefore be limited.  In addition,  the Internal  Revenue Codelimits our ability to sell our  properties.  If we must sell an  investment,  wecannot  ensure  that  we will be able to  dispose  of the  investment  at  termsfavorable to the Company.     We face possible environmental liabilities.  Current and former real estateowners  and  operators  may be  required  by law to  investigate  and  clean  uphazardous  substances  released at the properties they own or operate.  They mayalso be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property ornatural  resource  damage,  investigation  costs and cleanup costs. In addition,some  environmental  laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of thegovernment  for damages and costs the government  incurs in connection  with the                                       4contamination.  Contamination  may affect  adversely the owner's ability to use,sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as  collateral.  Wehave no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liabilityto which we may be subject arising out of environmental conditions or violationswith respect to the  properties  we currently or formerly  owned.  Environmentallaws today can impose  liability  on a previous  owner or operator of a propertythat owned or operated the property at a time when hazardous or toxic substanceswere disposed of,  released  from, or present at, the property.  A conveyance ofthe property,  therefore, does not relieve the owner or operator from liability.Although  ESAs have been  conducted  at our  properties  to  identify  potentialsources  of  contamination  at the  properties,  such  ESAs  do not  reveal  allenvironmental  liabilities  or  compliance  concerns  that could  arise from theproperties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concernsmay  exist,  of which we are  currently  unaware,  that in the future may have amaterial adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Financing Risks     We face  risks  associated  with the use of debt to fund  acquisitions  anddevelopments,  including  refinancing risk. We are subject to the risks normallyassociated  with debt  financing,  including the risk that our cash flow will beinsufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  We anticipatethat a  portion  of the  principal  of our  debt  will  not be  repaid  prior tomaturity.  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of ouroutstanding  debt  as it  matures.  There  is a risk  that we may not be able torefinance  existing  debt or that the  terms of any  refinancing  will not be asfavorable as the terms of the existing debt.     We face risks related to ""balloon  payments."" Certain of our mortgages willhave  significant  outstanding  principal  balances  on  their  maturity  dates,commonly known as ""balloon  payments."" There can be no assurance whether we willbe able to refinance such balloon  payments on the maturity of the loans,  whichmay  force  disposition  of  properties  on  disadvantageous  terms  or  requirereplacement with debt with higher interest rates,  either of which would have anadverse  impact on our  financial  performance  and ability to pay  dividends toinvestors.     We face  risks  associated  with our  dependence  on  external  sources  ofcapital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distributeto our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,  and we are subjectto tax on our  income  to the  extent  it is not  distributed.  Because  of thisdistribution  requirement,  we may not be able to fund all future  capital needsfrom cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we relyon  third-party  sources  of  capital,  which  we may not be able to  obtain  onfavorable terms, if at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital dependsupon a number of factors,  including  (i) general  market  conditions;  (ii) themarket's  perception  of our growth  potential;  (iii) our current and potentialfuture earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capitalstock.  Additional debt financing may  substantially  increase our debt-to-totalcapitalization ratio. Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of ourcurrent stockholders.     Covenants in our credit agreements could limit our flexibilty and adverselyaffect our financial condistion.  The terms of our various credit agreements andother indebtedness require us to comply with a number of customary financial andother  covenants,  such as maintaining debt service coverage and leverage ratiosand maintaining insurance coverage. These covenants may limit our flexibility inour operatins,  and breaches of these  covenants  could result in defaults underthe instruments  governing the applicable  indebtedness even if we had satisfiedour payment  obligations.  If we are unable to  refinance  our  indebtedness  atmaturity or meet our payment  obligations,  the amount of our distributable cashflow and our financial condition would be adversely affected.     Fluctuations  in interest  rates may adversely  affect our  operations  andvalue of our stock. As of December 31, 2007, we had  approximately  $135 millionof variable  interest rate debt. As of December 31, 2007,  the weighted  averageinterest  rate  on  our  variable  rate  debt  was  5.65%.  We  may  also  incurindebtedness  in the future that bears  interest at a variable rate or we may berequired to refinance our existing debt at higher rates. Accordingly,  increasesin interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability topay expected distributions to stockholders and the value of our stock.     A lack of any  limitation  on our debt could  result in our  becoming  morehighly  leveraged.   Our  governing   documents  do  not  limit  the  amount  ofindebtedness  we may  incur.  Accordingly,  our  Board of  Directors  may  incuradditional  debt and would do so, for example,  if it were necessary to maintainour status as a REIT. We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and ourfinancial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might benegatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other Risks     The  market  value  of  our  common  stock  could  decrease  based  on  ourperformance and market perception and conditions. The market value of our commonstock  may be  based  primarily  upon  the  market's  perception  of our  growthpotential and current and future cash  dividends,  and may be secondarily  basedupon the real estate market value of our underlying  assets. The market price ofour common stock is influenced  by the dividend on our common stock  relative tomarket  interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential  buyers of ourcommon stock to expect a higher dividend rate,  which would adversely affect themarket price of our common  stock.  In  addition,  rising  interest  rates wouldresult in  increased  expense,  thereby  adversely  affecting  cash flow and ourability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.     We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we willnot be allowed to deduct  distributions to stockholders in computing our taxableincome and will be  subject to federal  income  tax,  including  any  applicablealternative  minimum tax, at regular  corporate  rates.  In addition,  we may bebarred   from   qualification   as  a  REIT   for  the  four   years   followingdisqualification.  The additional tax incurred at                                       5regular corporate rates would  significantly  reduce the cash flow available fordistribution  to  stockholders  and for debt service.  Furthermore,  we would nolonger be required by the Internal Revenue Code to make any distributions to ourstockholders  as  a  condition  of  REIT  qualification.  Any  distributions  tostockholders  would be taxable as  ordinary  income to the extent of our currentand accumulated earnings and profits, although such dividend distributions wouldbe  subject  to  a  top  federal  tax  rate  of  15%  through  2010.   Corporatedistributees,  however,  may be eligible for the dividends received deduction onthe  distributions,  subject to limitations  under the Internal Revenue Code. Toqualify as a REIT,  we must comply with  certain  highly  technical  and complexrequirements.  We cannot be certain  we have  complied  with these  requirementsbecause  there are few  judicial  and  administrative  interpretations  of theseprovisions.  In addition, facts and circumstances that may be beyond our controlmay affect our  ability  to  qualify  as a REIT.  We cannot  assure you that newlegislation, regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions willnot change the tax laws  significantly  with respect to our  qualification  as aREIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of qualification. Wecannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.     There  is a risk  of  changes  in the  tax law  applicable  to real  estateinvestment  trusts.  Since the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  the  United  StatesTreasury   Department  and  Congress   frequently   review  federal  income  taxlegislation,  we cannot predict whether,  when or to what extent new federal taxlaws,  regulations,  interpretations  or rulings  will be  adopted.  Any of suchlegislative  action may prospectively or retroactively  modify our tax treatmentand, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.     Our Charter  contains  provisions  that may  adversely  affect the value ofshareholders' stock. Our charter generally limits any holder from acquiring morethan  9.8%  (in  value  or in  number,  whichever  is more  restrictive)  of ouroutstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, exceptour  excess  stock).   The  ownership   limit  may  limit  the  opportunity  forstockholders  to receive a premium for their  shares of common  stock that mightotherwise  exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares inexcess of 9.8% of the outstanding  shares of equity stock or otherwise  effect achange in control. Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of ourcommon stock is necessary for  stockholders to call a special  meeting.  We alsorequire  advance  notice by  stockholders  for the  nomination  of  directors orproposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders.     We have adopted a stockholder rights plan that may make a change in controldifficult.  Under the terms of the plan, we declared a dividend of rights on ourcommon stock.  The rights issued under the plan will be triggered,  with certainexceptions,  if and when any person or group  acquires,  or  commences  a tenderoffer to acquire,  15% or more of our shares, our Board of Directors  determinesthat a  substantial  stockholder's  ownership may be adverse to the interests ofour other  stockholders or our qualification as a REIT, or other similar events.The plan could have the effect of deterring or preventing our acquisition,  evenif a majority of our stockholders were in favor of such  acquisition,  and couldhave the  effect  of  making  it more  difficult  for a person  or group to gaincontrol of us or to change existing management.     The Company faces risks in attracting and retaining key personnel.  Many ofour  senior  executives  have  strong  industry  reputations,  which  aid  us inidentifying  acquisition and  development  opportunities  and  negotiating  withtenants  and  sellers  of  properties.  The loss of the  services  of these  keypersonnel could affect our operations  because of diminished  relationships withexisting and prospective  tenants,  property sellers and industry personnel.  Inaddition,  attracting  new  or  replacement  personnel  may  be  difficult  in acompetitive market.     We have  severance  and change in control  agreements  with  certain of ourofficers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certaintime period (as set in the officer's  agreement)  following a change in control,we terminate the officer's  employment  other than for cause,  or if the officerelects to terminate his or her employment  with us for reasons  specified in theagreement,  we will make a  severance  payment  equal to the  officer's  averageannual  compensation  times an  amount  specified  in the  officer's  agreement,together with the  officer's  base salary and vacation pay that have accrued butare unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a changein control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control ofus.     Our  Board  of  Directors  may  authorize  and  issue  securities   withoutstockholder approval. Under our Charter, the Board has the power to classify andreclassify  any of our unissued  shares of capital  stock into shares of capitalstock with such  preferences,  rights,  powers and  restrictions as the Board ofDirectors  may  determine.  The  authorization  and  issuance  of a new class ofcapital  stock  could have the effect of  delaying or  preventing  someone  fromtaking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' bestinterests.     Maryland  business  statutes  may limit  the  ability  of a third  party toacquire   control  of  us.   Maryland  law  provides   protection  for  Marylandcorporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting,  among other things, theduties of the  directors  in  unsolicited  takeover  situations.  The  duties ofdirectors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept,  recommendor  respond  to any  proposal  by a person  seeking  to  acquire  control of thecorporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modifyor render  inapplicable,  any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determinationunder the  Maryland  Business  Combination  Act or the  Maryland  Control  ShareAcquisition  Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely  because of the effect of theact or failure to act may have on an  acquisition  or potential  acquisition  ofcontrol of the  corporation or the amount or type of  consideration  that may beoffered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Marylandlaw the act of a director of a Maryland  corporation relating to or affecting anacquisition  or  potential  acquisition  of control is not subject to any higherduty or  greater  scrutiny  than is  applied  to any  other  act of a  director.Maryland law also contains a statutory  presumption that an act of a director ofa Maryland  corporation  satisfies  the  applicable  standards  of  conduct  fordirectors under Maryland law.                                       6     The Maryland  Business  Combination  Act provides that unless  exempted,  aMaryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers,dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares ofstock and other specified transactions,  with an ""interested  stockholder"" or anaffiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent dateon which the  interested  stockholder  became  an  interested  stockholder,  andthereafter  unless  specified  criteria are met. An  interested  stockholder  isgenerally a person owning or controlling,  directly or indirectly, 10 percent ormore of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.     The Maryland  Control Share  Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares""of a corporation  acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no votingrights  except  to the  extent  approved  by a vote of  two-thirds  of the voteseligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, ifaggregated with all other shares of stock  previously  acquired by the acquirer,would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors withinone of the following ranges of the voting power: one-tenth or more but less thanone-third,  one-third  or more but less than a majority or a majority or more ofall voting power. A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of controlshares, subject to certain exceptions.     If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share  acquisitionare not approved at a stockholders'  meeting, then subject to certain conditionsand limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fairvalue.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a  stockholders'meeting and the  acquirer  becomes  entitled to vote a majority of the shares ofstock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights"

In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by referencein this document,  readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.Any of these  risks or the  occurrence  of any one or more of the  uncertaintiesdescribed below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's  financialcondition and the  performance of its business.  The Company refers to itself as""we"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry Risks     We face risks  associated with local real estate  conditions in areas wherewe own properties.  We may be affected adversely by general economic  conditionsand local real estate  conditions.  For example,  an  oversupply  of  industrialproperties in a local area or a decline in the  attractiveness of our propertiesto tenants  would have a negative  effect on us.  Other  factors that may affectgeneral economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:     o    population and demographic trends;     o    employment and personal income trends;     o    income tax laws;     o    changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;     o    increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and          real estate  taxes,  due to inflation  and other factors which may not          necessarily be offset by increased rents; and     o    construction costs.     We may  be  unable  to  compete  with  our  larger  competitors  and  otheralternatives  available to tenants or potential  tenants of our properties.  Thereal  estate  business  is highly  competitive.  We  compete  for  interests  inproperties with other real estate  investors and  purchasers,  many of whom havegreater financial resources,  revenues, and geographical diversity than we have.Furthermore,  we compete  for tenants  with other  property  owners.  All of ourindustrial  properties are subject to  significant  local  competition.  We alsocompete  with a wide variety of  institutions  and other  investors  for capitalfunds  necessary  to support our  investment  activities  and asset  growth.  Inaddition,  our portfolio of industrial  properties faces  competition from otherproperties within each submarket where they are located.     We are subject to  significant  regulation  that  inhibits our  activities.Local  zoning  and use  laws,  environmental  statutes  and  other  governmentalrequirements   restrict  our  expansion,   rehabilitation   and   reconstructionactivities.  These  regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economicopportunities.  Legislation  such as the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act mayrequire  us to modify  our  properties  and  noncompliance  could  result in theimposition  of fines  or an  award  of  damages  to  private  litigants.  Futurelegislation  may  impose  additional   requirements.   We  cannot  predict  whatrequirements  may be enacted or what  changes  may be  implemented  to  existinglegislation.Risks Associated with Our Properties     We may be unable to lease space.  When a lease expires,  a tenant may electnot to renew it. We may not be able to re-lease the  property on similar  terms,if we are able to re-lease the property at all. The terms of renewal or re-lease(including the cost of required  renovations  and/or concessions to tenants) maybe less favorable to us than the prior lease. We also develop properties with nopre-leasing.  If we are  unable to lease  all or a  substantial  portion  of ourproperties,  or if the rental  rates upon such leasing are  significantly  lowerthan expected  rates,  our cash  generated  before debt  repayments  and capitalexpenditures,  and our ability to make expected  distributions  to stockholders,may be adversely affected.     We  have  been  and  may  continue  to be  affected  negatively  by  tenantbankruptcies and leasing delays. At any time, a tenant may experience a downturnin its business that may weaken its financial  condition.  Similarly,  a generaldecline  in the  economy  may result in a decline in the demand for space at ourindustrial  properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease  commencement,fail to make rental  payments  when due, or declare  bankruptcy.  Any such eventcould result in the  termination  of that  tenant's  lease and losses to us, anddistributions to investors may decrease. We receive a substantial portion of ourincome as rents under long-term leases. If tenants are unable to comply with theterms of their leases because of rising costs or falling  sales,  we may deem itadvisable  to  modify  lease  terms to allow  tenants  to pay a lower  rent or asmaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs. If a tenant becomesinsolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be sure that we could recover the premises fromthe tenant promptly or from a trustee or  debtor-in-possession in any bankruptcyproceeding  relating to the tenant. We also cannot be sure that we would receiverent in the  proceeding  sufficient  to cover our  expenses                                       3with  respect  to the  premises.  If a  tenant  becomes  bankrupt,  the  federalbankruptcy code will apply and, in some  instances,  may restrict the amount andrecoverability  of our claims  against  the  tenant.  A tenant's  default on itsobligations to us could adversely affect our financial condition and the cash wehave available for distribution.     Our  investment  in  property  development  may  be  more  costly  than  weanticipate.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditionswarrant such  investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results inaccordance with our  expectations.  Risks associated with our current and futuredevelopment and construction activities include:     o    the availability of favorable financing alternatives;     o    construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest          rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;     o    construction  and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service,          fixed expenses and construction costs;     o    expenditure  of funds and  devotion of  management's  time to projects          that we do not complete;     o    occupancy rates and rents at newly completed  properties may fluctuate          depending  on a number  of  factors,  including  market  and  economic          conditions,  resulting  in lower  than  projected  rental  rates and a          corresponding lower return on our investment; and     o    complications   (including   building   moratoriums   and  anti-growth          legislation)  in  obtaining  necessary  zoning,  occupancy  and  other          governmental permits.     We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individualproperties and  portfolios of  properties,  and intend to continue to do so. Ouracquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:     o    when we are able to locate a desired property,  competition from other          real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;     o    acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;     o    the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping  acquired properties          may be higher than our estimates;     o    acquired  properties may be located in new markets where we face risks          associated with an incomplete  knowledge or understanding of the local          market, a limited number of established business  relationships in the          area  and  a  relative   unfamiliarity  with  local  governmental  and          permitting procedures;     o    we  may  be  unable  to  quickly   and   efficiently   integrate   new          acquisitions,  particularly  acquisitions of portfolios of properties,          into  our  existing  operations,  and  as a  result,  our  results  of          operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and     o    we may  acquire  properties  subject to  liabilities  and  without any          recourse,  or with only  limited  recourse,  with  respect  to unknown          liabilities.  As a result,  if a claim were asserted  against us based          upon ownership of those  properties,  we might have to pay substantial          sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.     Coverage under our existing  insurance  policies may be inadequate to coverlosses.  We  generally  maintain  insurance  policies  related to our  business,including casualty, general liability and other policies,  covering our businessoperations,  employees  and  assets.  However,  we would be required to bear alllosses that are not  adequately  covered by  insurance.  In addition,  there arecertain  losses that are not generally  insured  because it is not  economicallyfeasible to insure against them,  including  losses due to riots or acts of war.If an uninsured  loss or a loss in excess of insured  limits occurs with respectto one or more of our properties,  then we could lose the capital we invested inthe properties,  as well as the anticipated  future revenue from the properties.In addition, if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness,  wewould continue to be liable for the indebtedness,  even if these properties wereirreparably  damaged.  Moreover,  as a number of our  properties  are located inCalifornia,  an area known for seismic activity, we may incur material losses inthe future in excess of insurance proceeds from our earthquake insurance.  Whilewe presently carry earthquake insurance on certain of our properties, the amountof our  insurance  coverage  may not be  sufficient  to fully cover  losses fromearthquakes.  In addition,  we may discontinue  earthquake or other insurance onsome or all of our  properties  in the future if the cost of premiums for any ofthese policies exceeds,  in our judgment,  the value of the coverage  discountedfor the risk of loss.     We face risks due to lack of geographic diversity. Substantially all of ourproperties  are  located  in the  Sunbelt  region of the United  States  with anemphasis in the states of California,  Florida, Texas and Arizona. A downturn ingeneral economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographicregions,  as a  result  of  oversupply  of  or  reduced  demand  for  industrialproperties,  local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics,would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.     We face risks due to the  illiquidity  of real  estate  which may limit ourability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.Our ability to vary our  portfolio  in response to changes in economic and otherconditions  will therefore be limited.  In addition,  the Internal  Revenue Codelimits our ability to sell our  properties.  If we must sell an  investment,  wecannot  ensure  that  we will be able to  dispose  of the  investment  at  termsfavorable to the Company.     We face possible environmental liabilities.  Current and former real estateowners  and  operators  may be  required  by law to  investigate  and  clean  uphazardous  substances  released at the properties they own or operate.  They mayalso be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property ornatural  resource  damage,  investigation  costs and cleanup costs. In addition,some  environmental  laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of thegovernment  for damages and costs the government  incurs in connection  with thecontamination.  Contamination  may affect  adversely the owner's ability to use,sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate as  collateral.  Wehave no way of determining at this time the magnitude of any potential liabilityto which we may be subject arising out of                                       4environmental  conditions  or  violations  with  respect  to the  properties  wecurrently or formerly owned.  Environmental laws today can impose liability on aprevious  owner or operator of a property that owned or operated the property ata time when hazardous or toxic  substances  were disposed of,  released from, orpresent at, the  property.  A conveyance of the  property,  therefore,  does notrelieve the owner or operator from liability.  Although ESAs have been conductedat  our  properties  to  identify  potential  sources  of  contamination  at theproperties,  such ESAs do not reveal all environmental liabilities or complianceconcerns that could arise from the properties.  Moreover, material environmentalliabilities or compliance concerns may exist, of which we are currently unaware,that in the future may have a material adverse effect on our business, assets orresults of operations.Financing Risks     We face  risks  associated  with the use of debt to fund  acquisitions  anddevelopments,  including  refinancing risk. We are subject to the risks normallyassociated  with debt  financing,  including the risk that our cash flow will beinsufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  We anticipatethat a  portion  of the  principal  of our  debt  will  not be  repaid  prior tomaturity.  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of ouroutstanding  debt  as it  matures.  There  is a risk  that we may not be able torefinance  existing  debt or that the  terms of any  refinancing  will not be asfavorable as the terms of the existing debt.     We face risks related to ""balloon  payments."" Certain of our mortgages willhave  significant  outstanding  principal  balances  on  their  maturity  dates,commonly known as ""balloon  payments."" There can be no assurance whether we willbe able to refinance such balloon  payments on the maturity of the loans,  whichmay  force  disposition  of  properties  on  disadvantageous  terms  or  requirereplacement with debt with higher interest rates,  either of which would have anadverse  impact on our  financial  performance  and ability to pay  dividends toinvestors.     We face  risks  associated  with our  dependence  on  external  sources  ofcapital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distributeto our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,  and we are subjectto tax on our  income  to the  extent  it is not  distributed.  Because  of thisdistribution  requirement,  we may not be able to fund all future  capital needsfrom cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we relyon  third-party  sources  of  capital,  which  we may not be able to  obtain  onfavorable terms, if at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital dependsupon a number of factors,  including  (i) general  market  conditions;  (ii) themarket's  perception  of our growth  potential;  (iii) our current and potentialfuture earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capitalstock.  Additional debt financing may  substantially  increase our debt-to-totalcapitalization ratio. Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of ourcurrent stockholders.     Fluctuations  in interest  rates may adversely  affect our  operations  andvalue of our stock. As of December 31, 2006, we had approximately $29 million ofvariable  interest  rate debt.  As of December  31, 2006,  the weighted  averageinterest  rate  on  our  variable  rate  debt  was  5.98%.  We  may  also  incurindebtedness  in the future that bears  interest at a variable rate or we may berequired to refinance our existing debt at higher rates. Accordingly,  increasesin interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability topay expected distributions to stockholders and the value of our stock.     A lack of any  limitation  on our debt could  result in our  becoming  morehighly  leveraged.   Our  governing   documents  do  not  limit  the  amount  ofindebtedness  we may  incur.  Accordingly,  our  Board of  Directors  may  incuradditional  debt and would do so, for example,  if it were necessary to maintainour status as a REIT. We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and ourfinancial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might benegatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other Risks     The  market  value  of  our  common  stock  could  decrease  based  on  ourperformance and market perception and conditions. The market value of our commonstock  may be  based  primarily  upon  the  market's  perception  of our  growthpotential and current and future cash  dividends,  and may be secondarily  basedupon the real estate market value of our underlying  assets. The market price ofour common stock is influenced  by the dividend on our common stock  relative tomarket  interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential  buyers of ourcommon stock to expect a higher dividend rate,  which would adversely affect themarket price of our common  stock.  In  addition,  rising  interest  rates wouldresult in  increased  expense,  thereby  adversely  affecting  cash flow and ourability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.     We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we willnot be allowed to deduct  distributions to stockholders in computing our taxableincome and will be  subject to federal  income  tax,  including  any  applicablealternative  minimum tax, at regular  corporate  rates.  In addition,  we may bebarred   from   qualification   as  a  REIT   for  the  four   years   followingdisqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular  corporate rates wouldsignificantly  reduce the cash flow available for  distribution  to stockholdersand for debt  service.  Furthermore,  we  would no  longer  be  required  by theInternal  Revenue  Code to  make  any  distributions  to our  stockholders  as acondition of REIT  qualification.  Any  distributions  to stockholders  would betaxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earningsand profits,  although  such  dividend  distributions  would be subject to a topfederal tax rate of 15% through 2010.  Corporate  distributees,  however, may beeligible for the dividends received  deduction on the distributions,  subject tolimitations  under the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  To qualify as a REIT,  we mustcomply with certain  highly  technical  and complex  requirements.  We cannot becertain we have complied with these requirements  because there are few judicialand administrative  interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts andcircumstances  that may be beyond our  control may affect our ability to qualifyas  a  REIT.   We  cannot   assure  you  that  new   legislation,   regulations,administrative                                       5interpretations  or court  decisions will not change the tax laws  significantlywith  respect to our  qualification  as a REIT or with  respect  to the  federalincome tax  consequences  of  qualification.  We cannot  assure you that we willremain qualified as a REIT.     There  is a risk  of  changes  in the  tax law  applicable  to real  estateinvestment  trusts.  Since the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  the  United  StatesTreasury   Department  and  Congress   frequently   review  federal  income  taxlegislation,  we cannot predict whether,  when or to what extent new federal taxlaws,  regulations,  interpretations  or rulings  will be  adopted.  Any of suchlegislative  action may prospectively or retroactively  modify our tax treatmentand, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.     Our Charter  contains  provisions  that may  adversely  affect the value ofshareholders' stock. Our charter generally limits any holder from acquiring morethan  9.8%  (in  value  or in  number,  whichever  is more  restrictive)  of ouroutstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, exceptour  excess  stock).   The  ownership   limit  may  limit  the  opportunity  forstockholders  to receive a premium for their  shares of common  stock that mightotherwise  exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares inexcess of 9.8% of the outstanding  shares of equity stock or otherwise  effect achange in control. Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of ourcommon stock is necessary for  stockholders to call a special  meeting.  We alsorequire  advance  notice by  stockholders  for the  nomination  of  directors orproposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders.     We have adopted a stockholder rights plan that may make a change in controldifficult.  Under the terms of the plan, we declared a dividend of rights on ourcommon stock.  The rights issued under the plan will be triggered,  with certainexceptions,  if and when any person or group  acquires,  or  commences  a tenderoffer to acquire,  15% or more of our shares, our Board of Directors  determinesthat a  substantial  stockholder's  ownership may be adverse to the interests ofour other  stockholders or our qualification as a REIT, or other similar events.The plan could have the effect of deterring or preventing our acquisition,  evenif a majority of our stockholders were in favor of such  acquisition,  and couldhave the  effect  of  making  it more  difficult  for a person  or group to gaincontrol of us or to change existing management.     We have  severance  and change in control  agreements  with  certain of ourofficers that may deter changes in control of the Company.  If, within a certaintime period (as set in the officer's  agreement)  following a change in control,we terminate the officer's  employment  other than for cause,  or if the officerelects to terminate his or her employment  with us for reasons  specified in theagreement,  we will make a  severance  payment  equal to the  officer's  averageannual  compensation  times an  amount  specified  in the  officer's  agreement,together with the  officer's  base salary and vacation pay that have accrued butare unpaid through the date of termination.  These agreements may deter a changein control because of the increased cost for a third party to acquire control ofus.     Our  Board  of  Directors  may  authorize  and  issue  securities   withoutstockholder approval. Under our Charter, the Board has the power to classify andreclassify  any of our unissued  shares of capital  stock into shares of capitalstock with such  preferences,  rights,  powers and  restrictions as the Board ofDirectors  may  determine.  The  authorization  and  issuance  of a new class ofcapital  stock  could have the effect of  delaying or  preventing  someone  fromtaking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' bestinterests.     Maryland  business  statutes  may limit  the  ability  of a third  party toacquire   control  of  us.   Maryland  law  provides   protection  for  Marylandcorporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting,  among other things, theduties of the  directors  in  unsolicited  takeover  situations.  The  duties ofdirectors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept,  recommendor  respond  to any  proposal  by a person  seeking  to  acquire  control of thecorporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modifyor render  inapplicable,  any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determinationunder the  Maryland  Business  Combination  Act or the  Maryland  Control  ShareAcquisition  Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely  because of the effect of theact or failure to act may have on an  acquisition  or potential  acquisition  ofcontrol of the  corporation or the amount or type of  consideration  that may beoffered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Marylandlaw the act of a director of a Maryland  corporation relating to or affecting anacquisition  or  potential  acquisition  of control is not subject to any higherduty or  greater  scrutiny  than is  applied  to any  other  act of a  director.Maryland law also contains a statutory  presumption that an act of a director ofa Maryland  corporation  satisfies  the  applicable  standards  of  conduct  fordirectors under Maryland law.     The Maryland  Business  Combination  Act provides that unless  exempted,  aMaryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers,dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares ofstock and other specified transactions,  with an ""interested  stockholder"" or anaffiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent dateon which the  interested  stockholder  became  an  interested  stockholder,  andthereafter  unless  specified  criteria are met. An  interested  stockholder  isgenerally a person owning or controlling,  directly or indirectly, 10 percent ormore of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.     The Maryland  Control Share  Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares""of a corporation  acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no votingrights  except  to the  extent  approved  by a vote of  two-thirds  of the voteseligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, ifaggregated with all other shares of stock  previously  acquired by the acquirer,would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors withinone of the following ranges of the voting power: one-tenth or more but less thanone-third,  one-third  or more but less than a majority or a majority or more ofall voting power. A ""control share acquisition"" means the acquisition of controlshares, subject to certain exceptions.     If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share  acquisitionare not approved at a stockholders'  meeting, then subject to certain conditionsand limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fairvalue.  If voting rights of such control                                       6shares are approved at a stockholders' meeting and the acquirer becomes entitledto  vote a  majority  of the  shares  of  stock  entitled  to  vote,  all  otherstockholders may exercise appraisal rights"

In addition to the other information contained or incorporated by referencein this document,  readers should carefully consider the following risk factors.Any of these  risks or the  occurrence  of any one or more of the  uncertaintiesdescribed below could have a material adverse effect on the Company's  financialcondition and the  performance of its business.  The Company refers to itself as""we"" or ""our"" in the following risk factors.Real Estate Industry Risks     We face risks  associated with local real estate  conditions in areas wherewe own properties.  We may be affected adversely by general economic  conditionsand local real estate  conditions.  For example,  an  oversupply  of  industrialproperties in a local area or a decline in the  attractiveness of our propertiesto tenants  would have a negative  effect on us.  Other  factors that may affectgeneral economic conditions or local real estate conditions include:     o    population and demographic trends;     o    employment and personal income trends;     o    income tax laws;     o    changes in interest rates and availability and costs of financing;     o    increased operating costs, including insurance premiums, utilities and          real estate  taxes,  due to inflation  and other factors which may not          necessarily be offset by increased rents; and     o    construction costs.     We may  be  unable  to  compete  with  our  larger  competitors  and  otheralternatives  available to tenants or potential  tenants of our properties.  Thereal  estate  business  is highly  competitive.  We  compete  for  interests  inproperties with other real estate  investors and  purchasers,  many of whom havegreater financial resources,  revenues, and geographical diversity than we have.Furthermore,  we compete  for tenants  with other  property  owners.  All of ourindustrial  properties are subject to  significant  local  competition.  We alsocompete  with a wide variety of  institutions  and other  investors  for capitalfunds  necessary  to support our  investment  activities  and asset  growth.  Inaddition,  our portfolio of industrial  properties faces  competition from otherproperties within each submarket where they are located.     We are subject to  significant  regulation  that  inhibits our  activities.Local  zoning  and use  laws,  environmental  statutes  and  other  governmentalrequirements   restrict  our  expansion,   rehabilitation   and   reconstructionactivities.  These  regulations may prevent us from taking advantage of economicopportunities.  Legislation  such as the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act mayrequire  us to modify  our  properties  and  noncompliance  could  result in theimposition  of fines  or an  award  of  damages  to  private  litigants.  Futurelegislation  may  impose  additional   requirements.   We  cannot  predict  whatrequirements  may be enacted or what  changes  may be  implemented  to  existinglegislation.Risks Associated with Our Properties     We may be unable to renew  leases or relet space as leases  expire.  When alease  expires,  a tenant may elect not to renew it. We may not be able to reletthe property on similar terms,  if we are able to relet the property at all. Theterms of renewal or re-lease (including the cost of required  renovations and/orconcessions to tenants) may be less favorable to us than the prior lease.  If weare unable to relet all or a substantial  portion of our  properties,  or if therental rates upon such reletting are  significantly  lower than expected  rates,our cash  generated  before debt  repayments and capital  expenditures,  and ourability  to  make  expected  distributions  to  stockholders,  may be  adverselyaffected.     We  have  been  and  may  continue  to be  affected  negatively  by  tenantbankruptcies and leasing delays. At any time, a tenant may experience a downturnin its business that may weaken its financial  condition.  Similarly,  a generaldecline  in the  economy  may result in a decline in the demand for space at ourindustrial  properties.  As a result, our tenants may delay lease  commencement,fail to make rental  payments  when due, or declare  bankruptcy.  Any such eventcould result in the  termination  of that  tenant's  lease and losses to us, anddistributions to investors may decrease. We receive a substantial portion of ourincome as rents under long-term leases. If tenants are unable to comply with theterms of their leases because of rising costs or falling  sales,  we may deem itadvisable  to  modify  lease  terms to allow  tenants  to pay a lower  rent or asmaller share of taxes, insurance and other operating costs. If a tenant becomesinsolvent or bankrupt, we cannot be surethat we could recover the premises from the tenant promptly or from a trustee ordebtor-in-possession  in any bankruptcy  proceeding  relating to the tenant.  Wealso cannot be sure that we would receive rent in the  proceeding  sufficient tocover our expenses with respect to the premises.  If a tenant becomes  bankrupt,the federal bankruptcy code will apply and, in some instances,  may restrict theamount and  recoverability  of our claims against the tenant. A tenant's defaulton its obligations to us could adversely affect our financial  condition and thecash we have available for distribution.     Our  investment  in  property  development  may  be  more  costly  than  weanticipate.  We intend to continue to develop properties where market conditionswarrant such  investment.  Once made, our investments may not produce results inaccordance with our  expectations.  Risks associated with our current and futuredevelopment and construction activities include:     o    the unavailabity of favorable financing alternatives;     o    construction costs exceeding original estimates due to rising interest          rates and increases in the costs of materials and labor;     o    construction  and lease-up delays resulting in increased debt service,          fixed expenses and construction costs;     o    expenditure  of funds and  devotion of  management's  time to projects          that we do not complete;     o    occupancy rates and rents at newly completed  properties may fluctuate          depending  on a number  of  factors,  including  market  and  economic          conditions,  resulting  in lower  than  projected  rental  rates and a          corresponding lower return on our investment; and     o    complications   (including   building   moratoriums   and  anti-growth          legislation)  in  obtaining  necessary  zoning,  occupancy  and  other          governmental permits.     We face risks associated with property acquisitions.  We acquire individualproperties and  portfolios of  properties,  and intend to continue to do so. Ouracquisition activities and their success are subject to the following risks:     o    when we are able to locate a desired property,  competition from other          real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;     o    acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;     o    the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping  acquired properties          may be higher than our estimates;     o    acquired  properties may be located in new markets where we face risks          associated with an incomplete  knowledge or understanding of the local          market, a limited number of established business  relationships in the          area  and  a  relative   unfamiliarity  with  local  governmental  and          permitting procedures;     o    we  may  be  unable  to  quickly   and   efficiently   integrate   new          acquisitions,  particularly  acquisitions of portfolios of properties,          into  our  existing  operations,  and  as a  result,  our  results  of          operations and financial condition could be adversely affected; and     o    we may  acquire  properties  subject to  liabilities  and  without any          recourse,  or with only  limited  recourse,  with  respect  to unknown          liabilities.  As a result,  if a claim were asserted  against us based          upon ownership of those  properties,  we might have to pay substantial          sums to settle it, which could adversely affect our cash flow.     Coverage under our existing  insurance  policies may be inadequate to coverlosses.  We  generally  maintain  insurance  policies  related to our  business,including casualty, general liability and other policies,  covering our businessoperations,  employees  and  assets.  However,  we would be required to bear alllosses that are not  adequately  covered by  insurance.  In addition,  there arecertain  losses that are not generally  insured  because it is not  economicallyfeasible to insure against them,  including  losses due to riots or acts of war.If an uninsured  loss or a loss in excess of insured  limits occurs with respectto one or more of our properties,  then we could lose the capital we invested inthe properties,  as well as the  anticipated  future revenue from the propertiesand,  in the  case of debt,  which  is with  recourse  to us,  we  would  remainobligated for any mortgage debt or other  financial  obligations  related to theproperties.  Moreover,  as a number of our properties are located in California,an area known for seismic  activity,  we may incur material losses in the futurein excess of  insurance  proceeds  from our  earthquake  insurance.  Although webelieve that our insurance  programs are adequate,  we cannot assure you that wewill not incur losses in excess of our  insurance  coverage,  or that we will beable to obtain  insurance  in the future at  acceptable  levels  and  reasonablecosts.     We face risks due to lack of geographic diversity. Substantially all of ourproperties  are  located  in the  Sunbelt  region of the United  States  with anemphasis in the states of California,  Florida, Texas and Arizona. A downturn ingeneral economic conditions and local real estate conditions in these geographicregions,  as a  result  of  oversupply  of  or  reduced  demand  for  industrialproperties,  local business climate, business layoffs and changing demographics,would have a particularly strong adverse effect on us.     We face risks due to the  illiquidity  of real  estate  which may limit ourability to vary our portfolio.  Real estate investments are relatively illiquid.Our ability to vary our  portfolio  in response to changes in economic and otherconditions  will therefore be limited.  In addition,  the Internal  Revenue Codelimits our ability to sell our  properties.  If we must sell an  investment,  wecannot  ensure  that  we will be able to  dispose  of the  investment  at  termsfavorable to the Company.     We face possible environmental liabilities.  Current and former real estateowners  and  operators  may be  required  by law to  investigate  and  clean  uphazardous  substances  released at the properties they own or operate.  They mayalso be liable to the government or to third parties for substantial property ornatural  resource  damage,  investigation  costs and cleanup costs. In addition,some  environmental  laws create a lien on the contaminated site in favor of thegovernment  for damages and costs the government  incurs in connection  with thecontamination.  Contamination  may affect  adversely the owner's ability to use,sell or lease real estate or to borrow using the real estate ascollateral.  We have no way of  determining  at this time the  magnitude  of anypotential  liability  to which we may be subject  arising  out of  environmentalconditions or violations with respect to the properties we currently or formerlyowned.  Environmental  laws today can impose  liability  on a previous  owner oroperator  of a  property  that owned or  operated  the  property  at a time whenhazardous or toxic  substances  were disposed of,  released from, or present at,the  property.  A conveyance of the  property,  therefore,  does not relieve theowner  or  operator  from  liability.   Although  Phase  I  environmental   siteassessments (""ESAs"") have been conducted at our properties to identify potentialsources  of  contamination  at the  properties,  such  ESAs  do not  reveal  allenvironmental  liabilities  or  compliance  concerns  that could  arise from theproperties.  Moreover, material environmental liabilities or compliance concernsmay  exist,  of which we are  currently  unaware,  that in the future may have amaterial adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations.Financing Risks     We face  risks  associated  with the use of debt to fund  acquisitions  anddevelopments,  including  refinancing risk. We are subject to the risks normallyassociated  with debt  financing,  including the risk that our cash flow will beinsufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest.  We anticipatethat a  portion  of the  principal  of our  debt  will  not be  repaid  prior tomaturity.  Therefore, we will likely need to refinance at least a portion of ouroutstanding  debt  as it  matures.  There  is a risk  that we may not be able torefinance  existing  debt or that the  terms of any  refinancing  will not be asfavorable as the terms of the existing debt.     We face risks related to ""balloon  payments."" Certain of our mortgages willhave  significant  outstanding  principal  balances  on  their  maturity  dates,commonly known as ""balloon  payments."" There can be no assurance whether we willbe able to refinance such balloon  payments on the maturity of the loans,  whichmay  force  disposition  of  properties  on  disadvantageous  terms  or  requirereplacement with debt with higher interest rates,  either of which would have anadverse  impact on our  financial  performance  and ability to pay  dividends toinvestors.     We face  risks  associated  with our  dependence  on  external  sources  ofcapital.  In order to qualify as a REIT, we are required each year to distributeto our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income,  and we are subjectto tax on our  income  to the  extent  it is not  distributed.  Because  of thisdistribution  requirement,  we may not be able to fund all future  capital needsfrom cash retained from operations.  As a result, to fund capital needs, we relyon  third-party  sources  of  capital,  which  we may not be able to  obtain  onfavorable terms, if at all. Our access to third-party sources of capital dependsupon a number of factors,  including  (i) general  market  conditions;  (ii) themarket's  perception  of our growth  potential;  (iii) our current and potentialfuture earnings and cash distributions; and (iv) the market price of our capitalstock.  Additional debt financing may  substantially  increase our debt-to-totalcapitalization ratio. Additional equity financing may dilute the holdings of ourcurrent stockholders.     Fluctuations  in interest  rates may adversely  affect our  operations  andvalue of our stock. As of December 31, 2005, we had  approximately  $117 millionof variable  interest rate debt. As of December 31, 2005,  the weighted  averageinterest  rate  on  our  variable  rate  debt  was  5.16%.  We  may  also  incurindebtedness  in the future that bears  interest at a variable rate or we may berequired to refinance our existing debt at higher rates. Accordingly,  increasesin interest rates could adversely affect our financial condition, our ability topay expected distributions to stockholders and the value of our stock.     A lack of any  limitation  on our debt could  result in our  becoming  morehighly  leveraged.   Our  governing   documents  do  not  limit  the  amount  ofindebtedness  we may  incur.  Accordingly,  our  board of  directors  may  incuradditional  debt and would do so, for example,  if it were necessary to maintainour status as a REIT. We might become more highly leveraged as a result, and ourfinancial condition and cash available for distribution to stockholders might benegatively affected and the risk of default on our indebtedness could increase.Other Risks     The  market  value  of  our  common  stock  could  decrease  based  on  ourperformance and market perception and conditions. The market value of our commonstock  may be  based  primarily  upon  the  market's  perception  of our  growthpotential and current and future cash  dividends,  and may be secondarily  basedupon the real estate market value of our underlying  assets. The market price ofour common stock is influenced  by the dividend on our common stock  relative tomarket  interest rates.  Rising interest rates may lead potential  buyers of ourcommon stock to expect a higher dividend rate,  which would adversely affect themarket price of our common  stock.  In  addition,  rising  interest  rates wouldresult in  increased  expense,  thereby  adversely  affecting  cash flow and ourability to service our indebtedness and pay dividends.     We may fail to qualify as a REIT.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT, we willnot be allowed to deduct  distributions to stockholders in computing our taxableincome and will be  subject to federal  income  tax,  including  any  applicablealternative  minimum tax, at regular  corporate  rates.  In addition,  we may bebarred   from   qualification   as  a  REIT   for  the  four   years   followingdisqualification.  The additional tax incurred at regular  corporate rates wouldsignificantly  reduce the cash flow available for  distribution  to stockholdersand for debt  service.  Furthermore,  we  would no  longer  be  required  by theInternal  Revenue  Code to  make  any  distributions  to our  stockholders  as acondition of REIT  qualification.  Any  distributions  to stockholders  would betaxable as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earningsand profits,  although  such  dividend  distributions  would be subject to a topfederal tax rate of 15% through 2008.  Corporate  distributees,  however, may beeligible for the dividends received  deduction on the distributions,  subject tolimitations  under the  Internal  Revenue  Code.  To qualify as a REIT,  we mustcomply with certain  highly  technical  and complex  requirements.  We cannot becertain we have complied with these requirements  because there are few judicialand administrative  interpretations of these provisions.  In addition, facts andcircumstances  that may be beyond ourcontrol may affect our ability to qualify as a REIT.  We cannot  assure you thatnew legislation, regulations,  administrative interpretations or court decisionswill not change the tax laws  significantly with respect to our qualification asa REIT or with respect to the federal income tax consequences of  qualification.We cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT.     There  is a risk  of  changes  in the  tax law  applicable  to real  estateinvestment  trusts.  Since the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  the  United  StatesTreasury   Department  and  Congress   frequently   review  federal  income  taxlegislation,  we cannot predict whether,  when or to what extent new federal taxlaws,  regulations,  interpretations  or rulings  will be  adopted.  Any of suchlegislative  action may prospectively or retroactively  modify our tax treatmentand, therefore, may adversely affect taxation of us and/or our investors.     Our Charter  contains  provisions  that may  adversely  affect the value ofshareholders' stock. Our charter generally limits any holder from acquiring morethan  9.8%  (in  value  or in  number,  whichever  is more  restrictive)  of ouroutstanding equity stock (defined as all of our classes of capital stock, exceptour  excess  stock).   The  ownership   limit  may  limit  the  opportunity  forstockholders  to receive a premium for their  shares of common  stock that mightotherwise  exist if an investor were attempting to assemble a block of shares inexcess of 9.8% of the outstanding  shares of equity stock or otherwise  effect achange in control. Also, the request of the holders of a majority or more of ourcommon stock is necessary for  stockholders to call a special  meeting.  We alsorequire  advance  notice by  stockholders  for the  nomination  of  directors orproposal of business to be considered at a meeting of stockholders.     We have adopted a stockholder rights plan that may make a change in controldifficult.  We have a stockholder  rights plan.  Under the terms of the plan, wedeclared a dividend of rights on our common stock and Series B preferred  stock.The rights issued under the plan will be triggered,  with certain exceptions, ifand when any person or group  acquires,  or commences a tender offer to acquire,15% or more of our shares, our Board of Directors  determines that a substantialstockholder's   ownership   may  be  adverse  to  the  interests  of  our  otherstockholders or our  qualification as a REIT, or other similar events.  The plancould have the effect of  deterring or  preventing  our  acquisition,  even if amajority of our stockholders were in favor of such  acquisition,  and could havethe effect of making it more  difficult for a person or group to gain control ofus or to change existing management.     We have change of control  agreements with certain of our officers that maydeter changes of control of the Company.  We have entered into change of controlagreements  with certain of our officers  providing  for the payment of money tothese  officers upon the occurrence of our change of control as defined in theseagreements. If, within a certain time period (as set in the officer's agreement)following a change of control, we terminate the officer's  employment other thanfor cause,  or if the officer elects to terminate his or her employment  with usfor reasons  specified in the agreement,  we will make a severance payment equalto the officer's  average annual  compensation  times an amount specified in theofficer's  agreement,  together with the officer's  base salary and vacation paythat  have  accrued  but are  unpaid  through  the  date of  termination.  Theseagreements  may deter our change of control  because of the increased cost for athird party to acquire control of us.     Our  Board  of  Directors  may  authorize  and  issue  securities   withoutstockholder approval. Under our Charter, the board has the power to classify andreclassify  any of our unissued  shares of capital  stock into shares of capitalstock with such  preferences,  rights,  powers and  restrictions as the board ofdirectors  may  determine.  The  authorization  and  issuance  of a new class ofcapital  stock  could have the effect of  delaying or  preventing  someone  fromtaking control of us, even if a change in control were in our stockholders' bestinterests.     Maryland  business  statutes  may limit  the  ability  of a third  party toacquire   control  of  us.   Maryland  law  provides   protection  for  Marylandcorporations against unsolicited takeovers by limiting,  among other things, theduties of the  directors  in  unsolicited  takeover  situations.  The  duties ofdirectors of Maryland corporations do not require them to (a) accept,  recommendor  respond  to any  proposal  by a person  seeking  to  acquire  control of thecorporation, (b) authorize the corporation to redeem any rights under, or modifyor render  inapplicable,  any stockholders rights plan, (c) make a determinationunder the  Maryland  Business  Combination  Act or the  Maryland  Control  ShareAcquisition  Act, or (d) act or fail to act solely  because of the effect of theact or failure to act may have on an  acquisition  or potential  acquisition  ofcontrol of the  corporation or the amount or type of  consideration  that may beoffered or paid to the stockholders in an acquisition.  Moreover, under Marylandlaw the act of a director of a Maryland  corporation relating to or affecting anacquisition  or  potential  acquisition  of control is not subject to any higherduty or  greater  scrutiny  than is  applied  to any  other  act of a  director.Maryland law also contains a statutory  presumption that an act of a director ofa Maryland  corporation  satisfies  the  applicable  standards  of  conduct  fordirectors under Maryland law.     The Maryland  Business  Combination  Act provides that unless  exempted,  aMaryland corporation may not engage in business combinations, including mergers,dispositions of 10 percent or more of its assets, certain issuances of shares ofstock and other specified transactions,  with an ""interested  stockholder"" or anaffiliate of an interested stockholder for five years after the most recent dateon which the  interested  stockholder  became  an  interested  stockholder,  andthereafter  unless  specified  criteria are met. An  interested  stockholder  isgenerally a person owning or controlling,  directly or indirectly, 10 percent ormore of the voting power of the outstanding stock of the Maryland corporation.     The Maryland  Control Share  Acquisition Act provides that ""control shares""of a corporation  acquired in a ""control share acquisition"" shall have no votingrights  except  to the  extent  approved  by a vote of  two-thirds  of the voteseligible to cast on the matter.  ""Control Shares"" means shares of stock that, ifaggregated with all other shares of stock  previously  acquired by the acquirer,would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors withinone of the following ranges of the voting power: one-tenth or more but less thanone-third,  one-third  or more but less than a majority or a majority or more of allvoting power. A ""control  share  acquisition""  means the  acquisition of controlshares, subject to certain exceptions.     If voting rights of control shares acquired in a control share  acquisitionare not approved at a stockholders'  meeting, then subject to certain conditionsand limitations, the issuer may redeem any or all of the control shares for fairvalue.  If voting rights of such control shares are approved at a  stockholders'meeting and the  acquirer  becomes  entitled to vote a majority of the shares ofstock entitled to vote, all other stockholders may exercise appraisal rights"
