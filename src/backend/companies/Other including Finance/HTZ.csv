RISK FACTORS (Continued)policies can be extremely complex and may often require us, together with our advisors, to make subjective determinations. Many countries routinely examine transfer pricing policies of taxpayers subject to their jurisdiction, challenge transfer pricing practices aggressively where there is potential non-compliance and impose significant interest charges and penalties where non-compliance is determined.We are subject to many forms of taxation in the jurisdictions throughout the world in which we operate, including, but not limited to, income tax, withholding tax and payroll-related taxes. Tax law and administration are extremely complex and often require us, together with our advisors, to make subjective determinations.In addition, our estimate of tax related assets, liabilities, recoveries and expenses may incorporate significant assumptions. These assumptions include, but are not limited to, the tax laws in various jurisdictions, the effect of tax treaties between jurisdictions, transfer pricing policies, taxable income projections, and the benefits of various restructuring plans. To the extent that such assumptions differ from actual results, we may have to record additional income tax expenses and liabilities.The tax authorities in the various jurisdictions where we conduct business might not agree with the determinations that we make with our advisors with respect to the application of tax law. Such disagreements could result in lengthy legal disputes and, ultimately, in the payment of substantial funds to the government authorities of foreign and local jurisdictions where we carry on business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows"

RISK FACTORS (Continued)backward-looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain.  At this time, due to a lack of consensus as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on our liquidity. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate certain of our financing agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. As of December 31, 2019, we had $5.7 billion in outstanding indebtedness tied to LIBOR. Additionally, these changes may have an impact on the value of or interest earned on any LIBOR-based marketable securities, fleet leases, loans and derivatives that are included in our financial assets and liabilities. RISKS RELATING TO HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC. COMMON STOCKHertz Holdings is a holding company with no operations of its own and depends on its subsidiaries for cash.The operations of Hertz Holdings are conducted nearly entirely through its subsidiaries and its ability to generate cash to meet its debt service obligations or to pay dividends on its common stock is dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. However, none of the subsidiaries of Hertz Holdings are obligated to make funds available to Hertz Holdings for the payment of dividends or the service of its debt. In addition, certain states' laws and the terms of certain of our debt agreements significantly restrict, or prohibit, the ability of Hertz and its subsidiaries to pay dividends, make loans or otherwise transfer assets to Hertz Holdings, including state laws that require dividends to be paid only from surplus. If Hertz Holdings does not receive cash from its subsidiaries, then Hertz Holdings' financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Hertz Holdings' share price may decline if it issues a large number of new shares or if a holder of a substantial number of shares sells their stock.Hertz Holdings has a significant number of authorized but unissued shares, including shares available for issuance pursuant to various equity plans. In addition, in recent years, several shareholders, most notably affiliates of Carl Icahn, have accumulated significant amounts of Hertz Holdings common stock and may have the ability to exert substantial influence over actions to be taken or approved by our stockholders, including the election of directors. A sale of a substantial number of shares or other equity-related securities in the public market pursuant to new issuances or by these significant shareholders could depress the market price of Hertz Holdings' stock and impair its ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. Any such sale or issuance would dilute the ownership interests of the then-existing stockholders and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of Hertz Holdings' common stock"

RISK FACTORS (Continued)arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.An increase in interest rates or in our borrowing margin would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.A significant portion of our outstanding debt bears interest at floating rates. As a result, to the extent we have not hedged against rising interest rates, an increase in the applicable benchmark interest rates would increase our cost of servicing our debt and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.In addition, we regularly refinance our indebtedness. If interest rates or our borrowing margins increase between the time an existing financing arrangement was consummated and the time such financing arrangement is refinanced, the cost of servicing our debt would increase and our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.RISKS RELATING TO HERTZ GLOBAL HOLDINGS, INC.
