RISK FACTORS In addition to the factors outlined previously in this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. 7  Risks Related to Our Industry Our business can be significantly impacted by economic conditions, customer business cycles and seasonal factors. Our business is dependent on the freight shipping needs of our customers, which can be heavily impacted by economic conditions and other factors affecting their businesses. Recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers, may substantially reduce freight volumes for which our customers need transportation services and lead to excess capacity in the industry and resulting pressure on the rates we are able to obtain for our services. Adverse economic conditions may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. In addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs. Any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our business can be significantly impacted by the effects of national or international health pandemics on general economic conditions and the operations of our customers and third-party suppliers and service providers. Our operations can be heavily impacted by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease. The effects of a pandemic may disrupt or restrict the freight shipping activities of some of our customers, on which our business is dependent. In addition, adverse economic conditions caused by a pandemic may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. Furthermore, pandemic related social and economic disruptions may lead to other events which could negatively impact our operations including service limitations of our third-party purchased transportation providers, reduced availability of drivers and other key employees, disruptions in the procurement of revenue equipment, restrictions at U.S. ports of call, excess capacity or rate reductions within the intermodal or trucking industries, inability of suppliers to continue activities, or volatile financial credit markets. The extent to which a pandemic will impact general economic and business conditions is highly uncertain and unpredictable; however, any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes, and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results. Certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations. Increases in the cost of our operations, such as towing and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter months. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including legislative and regulatory responses to climate change. Compliance with environmental requirements could result in significant expenditures and the violation of these regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities. If a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. We are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change. If current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced, we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. 8  We depend on third parties in the operation of our business.  Our JBI business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services. The majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads. While we have agreements with a number of Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the BNSF and the Norfolk Southern railways. The transportation services provided by these railroads have been in recent years and may from time to time in the future be impacted by contractual disagreements, labor disruptions or shortages, and other rail network inefficiencies. A material change in the relationship with, the ability to utilize or the overall service levels provided by one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts. Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business. We regularly purchase new revenue equipment, including trucks, chassis and trailing equipment, in each of our operating segments to expand our fleets and replace aging equipment. Any significant delays in the availability of new revenue equipment or increases in the cost of such equipment could have a material adverse affect on our business and profitability by reducing productivity, increasing maintenance expenses and capital expenditures, and limiting our ability to expand our business. We also utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to complete our services. These third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements, which may have a more significant impact on their operations, causing them to exit the transportation industry. Aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads, we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads. The inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth. Rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results. Fuel costs can be very volatile. We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs. Most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel. However, there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers. In addition, we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to customers. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. As of December 31, 2023, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations. Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings. Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. We have experienced substantial increases in the severity of auto liability claims which have exceeded our insurance coverage layers, which has adversely impacted our operating results in recent periods. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured continues to increase, our operating results could be further adversely affected. We have policies in place for 2024 with substantially the same terms as our 2023 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage. We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are self-insured. If these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. The DOT, FMCSA, and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, and financial reporting. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations to which we are subject, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments. Further, these agencies could institute new laws, rules or regulations or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time. Compliance with new laws, rules or regulations could substantially impair labor and equipment productivity, increase our costs or impact our ability to offer certain services. 9  Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees, we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle, dispose of the equipment altogether, or rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. In addition, our growth could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services. We operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry. Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets. We compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with LTL carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins. In an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors. Also, certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations, thereby reducing their need for our services. Risks Related to Our Business We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2023, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 36% of our revenue. One customer accounted for approximately 13% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2023. Our JBI, ICS, and JBT segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers. While our DCS and FMS segments may involve long-term written contracts, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. A determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.  Federal and state legislation as well as tax and other regulatory authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry are employees rather than independent contractors. Recently issued rulemaking by the U.S. Department of Labor, which takes effect on March 11, 2024, and the laws of several states, including California, apply stricter tests for determining whether an independent contractor should be classified as an employee. We believe we are in compliance with all applicable independent contractor classification requirements. However, it is possible that other federal or state legislation or regulations could be enacted or that various authorities could assert a position that re-classifies independent contractors as employees. If our independent contractors are determined to be properly classified as employees, that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, as well as our potential liability for employee benefits. In addition, such changes may be applied retroactively, and if so, we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate individuals for prior time periods. Any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results. 10  We may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures. We by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation, including personal injury claims, vehicular collisions and accidents, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, such as class-action lawsuits alleging wage and hour violations and improper pay, commercial and contract disputes, cargo loss and property damage claims. While we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate, future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance. We accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation, its likelihood of success, and an evaluation of the possible range of loss. Our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure or security breach of which or an inability to keep pace with technological advances could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate, track, and complete customer orders; process financial and nonfinancial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. We have also invested significantly in the development of our Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 online freight matching platform. Each of our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions, including equipment or network failures, failed upgrades or replacement of software, user error, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, theft or misuse of data, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, or other security breaches. We have in the past experienced security breaches and other interruptions of our information technology systems and may in the future experience such breaches or interruptions despite our best efforts to prevent them. We have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient. A significant disruption, failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could include operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims, or damage to our business reputation. We also could experience an inability to keep pace with technological advances, resulting in our information technology platforms becoming obsolete or our competitors developing related or similar service offerings more effective than ours. Acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings. Future growth strategies for our operating segments may involve the acquisition of one or more businesses. We could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets, personnel and operations with our own.  Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, and increase our operating costs.  Acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations; potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies; difficulties in maintaining controls, procedures and policies; potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel; potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees; failure to realize expected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired. Our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination, many of which cannot be presently identified. "

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, equipment manufacturers have experienced production and delivery delays due to work stoppages, supply chain disruptions and high demand that have impacted the availability, cost and timing of our receipt of new equipment orders. Any continued or future delays in the availability of new revenue equipment or further increases in the cost of such equipment could have a material adverse affect on our business and profitability by reducing productivity, increasing maintenance expenses and capital expenditures, and limiting our ability to expand our business. We also utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to complete our services.

An example of such legislation has recently gone into effect in California, although a legal challenge to the law is pending. There can be no assurance that interpretations that support the independent contractor status will not change, that other federal or state legislation will not be enacted or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that re-classifies independent contractors to be employees. If our independent contractors are determined to be our employees, that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, as well as our potential liability for employee benefits.

We could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets, personnel and operations with our own.  Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, and increase our operating costs.  Acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations; potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies; difficulties in maintaining controls, procedures and policies; potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel; potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees; failure to realize expected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired. Our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination involving FMS or other segments, many of which cannot be presently identified. "

While we have agreements with a number of Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the BNSF and the Norfolk Southern railways. A material change in the relationship with, the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts. Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business. We also utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to complete our services. These third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements, which may have a more significant impact on their operations, causing them to exit the transportation industry. Aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads, we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads. The inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth. Rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results. Fuel costs can be very volatile. We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs. Most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel. However, there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers. In addition, we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to customers. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. As of December 31, 2021, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations.       9                  Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings. Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have policies in place for 2022 with substantially the same terms as our 2021 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage. We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are self-insured. If these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. The DOT, FMCSA, and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, and financial reporting. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations to which we are subject, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments. Further, these agencies could institute new laws, rules or regulations or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time. Compliance with new laws, rules or regulations could substantially impair labor and equipment productivity, increase our costs or impact our ability to offer certain services. Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees, we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle, dispose of the equipment altogether, or rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. In addition, our growth could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services. We operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry. Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets. We compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with LTL carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins. In an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors. Also, certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations, thereby reducing their need for our services. Risks Related to Our Business We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2021, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 39% of our revenue. One customer accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our JBI, ICS, and JBT segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers. While our DCS and FMS segments may involve long-term written contracts, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.       10                  A determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.  Federal and state legislation as well as tax and other regulatory authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry are employees rather than independent contractors. An example of such legislation recently enacted in California is currently under a judicial stay with respect to trucking companies while a legal challenge to the law is pending. There can be no assurance that interpretations that support the independent contractor status will not change, that other federal or state legislation will not be enacted or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that re-classifies independent contractors to be employees. If our independent contractors are determined to be our employees, that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, as well as our potential liability for employee benefits. In addition, such changes may be applied retroactively, and if so, we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods. Any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results. We may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures. We by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation, including personal injury claims, vehicular collisions and accidents, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, such as class-action lawsuits alleging wage and hour violations and improper pay, commercial and contract disputes, cargo loss and property damage claims. While we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate, future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance. We accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation, its likelihood of success, and an evaluation of the possible range of loss. Our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure or security breach of which or an inability to keep pace with technological advances could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate, track, and complete customer orders; process financial and nonfinancial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. We have also invested significantly in the development of our Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 online freight matching platform, through which we are generating an increasing amount of revenue. Each of our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions, including equipment or network failures, failed upgrades or replacement of software, user error, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, theft or misuse of data, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, or other security breaches. We have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient. A significant disruption, failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could include operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims, or damage to our business reputation. We also could experience an inability to keep pace with technological advances, resulting in our information technology platforms becoming obsolete or our competitors developing related or similar service offerings more effective than ours.       11                  Acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings. A substantial portion of the growth of our FMS segment has resulted from strategic acquisitions, and our future growth strategy for FMS and possibly other operating segments may involve the acquisition of one or more businesses. We could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets, personnel and operations with our own.  Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, and increase our operating costs.  Acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations; potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies; difficulties in maintaining controls, procedures and policies; potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel; potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees; failure to realize expected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired. Our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination involving FMS or other segments, many of which cannot be presently identified. "

RISK FACTORS In addition to the factors outlined previously in this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Risks Related to Our Industry Our business is significantly impacted by economic conditions, customer business cycles and seasonal factors. Our business is dependent on the freight shipping needs of our customers, which can be heavily impacted by economic conditions and other factors affecting their businesses. Recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers, may substantially reduce freight volumes for which our customers need transportation services and lead to excess capacity in the industry and resulting pressure on the rates we are able to obtain for our services. Adverse economic conditions may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. In addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs. Any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.       7                  Our business is significantly impacted by the effects of national or international health pandemics on general economic conditions and the operations of our customers and third-party suppliers and service providers. Our operations can be heavily impacted by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, principally the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. This virus has spread throughout multiple countries, including the United States, and in March 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a pandemic. The effects of COVID-19 have and may continue to disrupt or restrict the freight shipping activities of some of our customers, on which our business is dependent. In addition, adverse economic conditions caused by COVID-19 may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. Furthermore, the continuation of COVID-19 related social and economic disruptions may lead to other events which could negatively impact our operations including service limitations of our third-party purchased transportation providers, reduced availability of drivers and other key employees, disruptions in the procurement of revenue equipment, restrictions at U.S. ports of call, excess capacity or rate reductions within the intermodal or trucking industries, inability of suppliers to continue activities, or volatile financial credit markets. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will impact general economic and business conditions is highly uncertain and unpredictable; however, any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes, and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results. Certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations. Increases in the cost of our operations, such as towing and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter months. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including legislative and regulatory responses to climate change. Compliance with environmental requirements could result in significant expenditures and the violation of these regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities. If a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. We are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change. If current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced, we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We depend on third parties in the operation of our business. Our JBI business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services.

Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. As of December 31, 2020, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations. Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings. Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have policies in place for 2021 with substantially the same terms as our 2020 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage. We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are self-insured. If these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected. We operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. The DOT, FMCSA, and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, and financial reporting.

Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets. We compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with LTL carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins. In an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors. Also, certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations, thereby reducing their need for our services.       8                  Extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes, and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results. Certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations. Increases in the cost of our operations, such as towing and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter months. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including legislative and regulatory responses to climate change. Compliance with environmental requirements could result in significant expenditures and the violation of these regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities. If a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability. We are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change. If current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced, we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Acquisitions or business combinations may disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings. We could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets, personnel and operations with our own.  Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, and increase our operating costs.  Acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations; potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies; difficulties in maintaining controls, procedures and policies; potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel; potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees; failure to realize expected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired. Our business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination, many of which cannot be presently identified. "

Our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our control. In addition to general U.S. economic trends, and to a lesser extent global economic trends, these factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads; rail service delays; disruptions to U.S. port-of-call activity; significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, fuel taxes, interest rates, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries, or license and registration fees; terrorist attacks or actions; acts of war; adverse weather conditions; disruption or failure of information technology systems; increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment; increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions in the procurement of imported revenue equipment; volatile financial credit markets; operational disruption or adverse effects of business acquisitions; and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party carriers. We are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers. Economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. In addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs. We depend on third parties in the operation of our business. Our JBI business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services. The majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads. While we have agreements with a number of Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the BNSF and the Norfolk Southern railways. A material change in the relationship with, the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts. Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business. In January 2017, we exercised our right to utilize the arbitration process to review the division of revenue collected beginning May 1, 2016, as well as to clarify other issues, under our Joint Service Agreement with BNSF. BNSF requested the same, and the arbitration process is on-going. On October 5, 2018, we received the arbitrators’ Interim Award. The details of the Interim Award are confidential and require the parties to submit additional information requested by the arbitrators to decide certain unresolved matters. For the determined components of the Interim Award, we recorded an $18.3 million pre-tax charge in the third quarter 2018, related to certain charges claimed by BNSF for specific services requested for customers from April 2014 through May 2018. On December 7, 2018 the arbitrators’ issued their Clarified Interim Award of October 5, 2018 resulting from some of the parties’ additional submissions to the Panel regarding certain issues related to determining the revenue division between the parties. On January 11, 2019, the Panel issued its Second Interim Award ordering that $89.4 million is due from the Company to BNSF resulting from the adjusted revenue divisions relating to the 2016 period at issue ($52.1 million) and for calendar year 2017 ($37.3 million). The parties have been instructed to make further submissions on the revenue divisions for calendar year 2018 and going forward, as well as other confidential issues raised during the arbitration process so that the panel can issue an appropriate interim and/or final award regarding all issues raised during the proceeding. We recorded pretax charges for contingent liabilities in the fourth quarter 2018 of $89.4 million claimed by the BNSF for the period May 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017 and $44.6 million for the period January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018, for a total of $134 million. The other financial implications from the Interim Award and the Clarified Interim Award will not be fully determined until the arbitrators issue additional award(s) following their review of each party’s requested additional submissions. At this time, we are unable to reasonably predict the final outcome of the arbitration, and, as such, no further gain or loss contingency can be determined or recorded. If decided adversely, this matter could result in a liability material to our financial condition or results of operations. BNSF provides a significant amount of rail transportation services to our JBI business segment. Normal commercial business activity between the parties, including load tendering, load tracing, billing and payments, is expected to continue on a timely basis. 6  We also utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to complete our services. These third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements, which may have a more significant impact on their operations, causing them to exit the transportation industry. Aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads, we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads. The inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth. Rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results. Fuel costs can be very volatile. We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs. Most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel. However, there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers. In addition, we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to customers. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. As of December 31, 2018, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations. Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings. Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have policies in place for 2019 with substantially the same terms as our 2018 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage, with the exception of decreasing our self-insured portion of workers’ compensation claims to zero for nearly all states. We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are self-insured. If these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2018, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 30% of our revenue. Our JBI, ICS, and JBT segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers. While our DCS segment business may involve long-term written contracts, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. The DOT, FMCSA, and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, and financial reporting. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations to which we are subject, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments. Further, these agencies could institute new laws, rules or regulations or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time. Compliance with new laws, rules or regulations could substantially impair labor and equipment productivity, increase our costs or impact our ability to offer certain services. 7  Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees, we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle, dispose of the equipment altogether, or rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. In addition, our growth could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services. A determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.  Tax and other regulatory authorities often seek to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry are employees rather than independent contractors. There can be no assurance that interpretations that support the independent contractor status will not change or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that re-classifies independent contractors to be employees. If our independent contractors are determined to be our employees, that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, as well as our potential liability for employee benefits. In addition, such changes may be applied retroactively, and if so, we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods. Any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results. We may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures. We by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation, including personal injury claims, vehicular collisions and accidents, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, such as class-action lawsuits alleging wage and hour violations and improper pay, commercial and contract disputes, cargo loss and property damage claims. While we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate, future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance. We accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation, its likelihood of success, and an evaluation of the possible range of loss. Our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate, track, and complete customer orders; process financial and nonfinancial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions, including equipment or network failures, failed upgrades or replacement of software, user error, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, or other security breaches. We have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient. A significant disruption, failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could include operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims, or damage to our business reputation. 8  We operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry.

If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.  7  Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees, we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle, dispose of the equipment altogether, or rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. In addition, our growth could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services. We rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure or security breach of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate, track, and complete customer orders; process financial and nonfinancial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions, including equipment or network failures, failed upgrades or replacement of software, user error, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, or other security breaches. We have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient. A significant disruption, failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could include operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims, or damage to our business reputation. We operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry. Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets. We compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with LTL carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins. In an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors. Also, certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations, thereby reducing their need for our services. Extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes, and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results. Certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations. Increases in the cost of our operations, such as towing and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter months. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs. Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties. We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities. If a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.  8  "

RISK FACTORS In addition to the forward-looking statements outlined previously in this Form 10-K and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks. Our business is subject to general economic and business factors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Economic trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our customers and suppliers, to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures. Our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include interference with or termination of our relationships with certain railroads; disruptions to U.S. port-of-call activity; significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, fuel taxes, interest rates, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, excess capacity in the intermodal or trucking industries, or license and registration fees; terrorist attacks or actions; acts of war; adverse weather conditions; disruption or failure of information technology systems; increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment; increased tariffs assessed on or disruptions in the procurement of imported revenue equipment; and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, independent contractors, and third-party carriers.  We are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers. Economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. In addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs. We depend on third parties in the operation of our business. Our JBI business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services. The majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads. While we have agreements with a number of Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Norfolk Southern railways. A material change in the relationship with or the inability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts. Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business.   6  We also utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to complete our services. These third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements, which may have a more significant impact on their operations, causing them to exit the transportation industry. Aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads, we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads. The inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth. Rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results. Fuel costs can be very volatile. We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs. Most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel. However, there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers. In addition, we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to customers. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. As of December 31, 2014, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations. Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings. Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have policies in place for 2015 with substantially the same terms as our 2014 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage. We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are self-insured. If these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. For the calendar year ended December 31, 2014, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 28% of our revenue. Our JBI, ICS, and JBT segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers. While our DCS segment business may involve a long-term written contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. We operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. The DOT and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, and financial reporting. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.   7  Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow. If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees, we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle, dispose of the equipment altogether, or rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.

levels, which could reduce our earnings.  If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely affected.  We have renewed our policies for 2012 with substantially the same terms as our 2011 policies for personal injury, workers’ compensation, cargo and property damage.  We have significantly reduced the self-insured portion of our workers’ compensation claims exposure and are fully insured for substantially all claims incurred since 2010.  We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are self-insured.  If these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.For the calendar year ended December 31, 2011, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 32% of our revenue.  Our JBI, JBT and ICS segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers.  While our DCS segment business may involve a written contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels.  A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.   7   We operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.The DOT and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety and financial reporting.  We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations.  If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.Significant changes in hours-of-service regulations and other motor carrier safety regulations could negatively impact our operations due to lower driver productivity or increased capital expenditures for monitoring and recordkeeping equipment.  In December 2011, the FMCSA amended the hours-of-service (HOS) safety requirements for commercial truck drivers.  Some provisions of the HOS Final Rule become effective February 27, 2012; others July 1, 2013.  FMCSA’s Final Rule will have a negative impact on productivity.   We continue to monitor the impact of new and proposed standards on acquisition and operating costs.Difficulty in attracting and retaining drivers, delivery personnel and third-party carriers could affect our profitability and ability to grow.If we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees or contract with enough independent contractors, we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle or dispose of the equipment altogether, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.  In addition, our growth could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services.We operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry.  Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets.We compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with LTL carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do.  Additionally, some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins.In an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.  Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors.  Also, certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations, thereby reducing their need for our services.Extreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results.Certain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations.  Increases in the cost of our operations, such as towing and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter months.  Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs.Our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could result in substantial fines or penalties.We are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water.  We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred.  Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage and hazardous waste disposal, among others.  We also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities.  If a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  If we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.   8   "

uncertainties, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business.  Our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.Our business is subject to general economic and business factors, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.  Economic trends and the tightening of credit in financial markets could adversely affect our ability, and the ability of our suppliers, to obtain financing for operations and capital expenditures.Our business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations, many of which are beyond our control.  These factors include interference with, or termination of, our relationships with certain railroads, significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, fuel taxes, interest rates, insurance premiums, self-insurance levels, excess capacity in the trucking industry, license and registration fees, terrorist attacks or actions, acts of war, adverse weather conditions, increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases in the value of used equipment, surpluses in the market for used equipment, and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers, independent contractors and third-party carriers.   7  We are also affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries such as retail and manufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers.  Economic conditions represent a greater potential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad debt losses.  In addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors.  Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs.We depend on third parties in the operation of our business.Our JBI business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services.  The majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads.  While we have agreements with various Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the Norfolk Southern railways.  The inability to utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.  In addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts.  Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our ICS business segment utilizes third-party carriers.  These third-parties are subject to similar regulation requirements noted previously, which may have a more significant impact on their operations causing them to exit the transportation industry.  Aside from periodic use of our trailing equipment to fulfill certain loads, we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering the loads.  The inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth.Rapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results.Fuel costs can be very volatile.  We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs.  Most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel.  However, there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers.  In addition, we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to customers.  Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability.  As of December 31, 2010, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations.Insurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical

and business factors that are largely out of our control, anyof which could have a material adverse effect on our results ofoperations.Our business is dependentupon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on the resultsof our operations, many of which are beyond our control.  These factors include significant increasesor rapid fluctuations in fuel prices, excess capacity in the trucking industry,interest rates, fuel taxes, license and registration fees, insurance premiums,self-insurance levels, interference with or termination of our relationshipswith certain railroads, terrorist attacks or actions, acts of war, adverseweather conditions, increased costs for new revenue equipment or decreases inthe value of used equipment, surpluses in the market for used equipment, anddifficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and independentcontractors.We are also affected byrecessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles,particularly in market segments and industries such as retail andmanufacturing, where we have a significant concentration of customers.  Economic conditions represent a greaterpotential for loss, and we may be required to increase our reserve for bad-debtlosses.  In addition, our results ofoperations may be affected by seasonal factors. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, andour operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due tocolder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle timeand higher maintenance costs.We operate in a competitive andsomewhat fragmented industry.  Numerousfactors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and tocompete with other carriers and private fleets.Some of these factorsinclude:·                  We compete with many other transportationcarriers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with less-than-truckloadcarriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capitalresources than we do.·                  Some of our competitors periodically reducetheir freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growthrates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increasefreight rates or maintain our profit margins.·                  Many customers reduce the number of carriersthey use by selecting so-called core carriers as approved transportationservice providers, and in some instances we may not be selected.·                  Many customers periodically accept bids frommultiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depressfreight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors.·                  Certain of our customers that operate privatefleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations.·                  The trend toward consolidation in thetrucking industry may create other large carriers with greater financialresources and other competitive advantages relating to their size.·                  Advances in technology require increasedinvestments to remain competitive, and our customers may not be willing toaccept higher freight rates to cover the cost of these investments.8 We derive a significant portionof our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business.For the calendar year endedDecember 31, 2006, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted forapproximately 40% of our revenue.  Ourlargest customer is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately14% of our total revenue in 2006.  OurJBT and JBI segments typically do not have long-term contracts with theircustomers.  While our DCS segmentbusiness may involve a written contract, those contracts may containcancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers willcontinue to utilize our services or that they will continue at the samelevels.  A reduction in or termination ofour services by one or more of our major customers could have a materialadverse effect on our business and operating results.We depend on third parties in theoperation of our business.Our JBI business segmentutilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services.  These services are provided pursuant tocontractual relationships with the railroads. While we have agreements with various Class I railroads, the majority ofour business travels on the Burlington Northern Santa Fe and the NorfolkSouthern Railroad.  The inability toutilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effect onour business and operating results.  Wealso utilize the services of a number of third-party dray carriers to perform asignificant number of our origin and destination pickups and deliveries.  In addition, a portion of the freight wedeliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subjectto labor union contracts.Difficulty in attracting andretaining drivers could affect our profitability and ability to grow.Periodically, the truckingindustry experiences substantial difficulty in attracting and retainingqualified drivers, including ICs.  Ashortage of qualified company drivers and ICs has proven to be particularlysevere during the past few years.  Inspite of continued increases in driver compensation and recruiting costs, theindustry is currently experiencing a shortage of drivers.  If we are unable to continue attracting anadequate number of drivers or contract with enough independent contractors, wecould be required to significantly increase our driver compensation package orlet trucks sit idle, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability.Ongoing insurance and claimsexpenses could significantly reduce our earnings.Our future insurance andclaims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce ourearnings.  During 2005, we self-insured aportion of our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury,property damage and health claims for amounts up to the first $2 million forauto accidents and $1 million for workers compensation.  During 2006, the self-insured portion of ourclaims exposure for all claims was reduced to $500,000.  If the number or severity of claims for whichwe are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adverselyaffected.  The self-insured portion ofour claims will also be $500,000 during 2007. We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we areself-insured.  Insurance carriers haverecently raised premiums for most trucking companies.  As a result, our insurance and claimsexpenses could increase when our current coverage expires.  If these expenses increase, and we are unableto offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could bematerially and adversely affected.The Internal Revenue Service(IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certainsale-and-leaseback transactions.As previously disclosed, theInternal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefitsassociated with certain sale-and-leaseback transactions, which we entered intoin 1999.  Based on events occurringsubsequent to December 31, 2004, we established a reserve for a contingent taxliability of $33.6 million at December 31, 2004.  The liability for this contingency, whichincludes estimated interest, is included on our Consolidated Balance Sheet atDecember 31, 2006, as a long-term liability. We have accrued approximately $3.0 million of interest expense during2006 related to this contingency.  We 9 continue to believe our tax positions comply withapplicable tax law for which we received advice and opinions from our thenexternal public accountants and attorneys prior to entering into thesetransactions, and we continue to vigorously defend against the IRS positionusing all administrative and legal processes available.  If the IRS were successful in disallowing100% of the tax benefit from this transaction, the total ultimate impact onliquidity could be approximately $44 million, excluding interest.Our operations are subject tovarious environmental laws and regulations, the violation of which could resultin substantial fines or penalties.We are subject to variousenvironmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardousmaterials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of stormwater.  We operate in industrial areas,where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located, and wheregroundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred.  Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillageor seepage, environmental damage and hazardous wastes disposal, amongothers.  We also maintain bulk fuelstorage and fuel islands at several of our facilities.  If we are involved in a spill or otheraccident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be in violationof applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect onour business and operating results.  Ifwe should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could besubject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.We operate in a regulatedindustry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, orliability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have amaterial adverse effect on our business.The DOT and various stateagencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing mattersincluding authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipmentoperation, safety and financial reporting. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliancewith various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations.  If we were found to be out of compliance, theDOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations.Effective October 1, 2005,driver HOS regulations were revised.  Themajority of these rule changes had initially been effective January 4,2004.  These collective changes were themost significant changes to driver HOS in more than 40 years.  In general, the new rules require a driver totake at least eight consecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a 10-houroff-duty period.  These new rulesprimarily affect short-haul and multiple-stop freight operations and had aminor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results.Effective with model-year2007 tractors, the EPA has mandated lower emission standards for newlymanufactured heavy-duty tractor engines. We are planning our new equipment purchases to accommodate these newstandards but also to allow adequate time for testing of the new engines. In2006, we began testing the 2007 model-year engines in a group of ourtractors.  We are unable to predict theimpact these new standards will have on our future operations and businessresults.Rapid changes in fuel costs couldimpact our periodic financial results.Fuel and fuel taxescurrently represent our third-largest general expense category.  During the past several years, fuel cost pergallon has varied significantly, with prices at times changing as much as $0.20to $0.25 per gallon between consecutive months. We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority ofour customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority ofhigher fuel costs.  Most of theseprograms automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel.  However, there can be timing differencesbetween a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billedto our customers.  In addition, we incuradditional costs when fuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due toour engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-routemiles that cannot be billed to customers. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a materialadverse effect on our operations or future profitability.  As of December 31, 2006, we had no derivativefinancial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations.10"

Our largestcustomer is Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., which accounted for approximately 15% of ourtotal revenue in 2005. Our JBT and JBI segments typically do not have long-termcontracts with their customers. While our DCS segment business may involve awritten contract, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and thereis no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize ourservices or that they will continue at the same levels. A reduction in or terminationof our services by one or more of our major customers could have a materialadverse effect on our business and operating results. Wedepend on third parties in the operation of our business. Our Intermodal business segment utilizes railroads in the performanceof its transportation services. These services are provided pursuant tocontractual relationships with the railroads. While we have agreements withvarious Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on theBurlington Northern Santa Fe and the Norfolk Southern Railroad. The inabilityto utilize one or more of these railroads could have a material adverse effecton our business and operating results.

A shortage ofqualified company drivers and ICs has proven to be particularly severe duringthe past few years. In spite of continued increases in driver compensation andrecruiting costs, the industry is currently experiencing a significant shortageof drivers. If we are unable to continue attracting an adequate number ofdrivers or contract with enough independent contractors, we could be requiredto significantly increase our driver compensation package or let trucks sitidle, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. Ongoinginsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings. Our future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historicallevels, which could reduce our earnings. During 2005, we self-insured a portionof our claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, propertydamage and health claims for amounts up to the first $2 million for autoaccidents and $1 million for workers compensation. Effective January 1, 2006,the self-insured portion of our claims exposure for personal injury and workerscompensation was reduced to $500,000. If the number or severity of claims forwhich we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adverselyaffected. Also, we maintain insurance above the amounts for which weself-insure with licensed insurance companies. Insurance carriers have recentlyraised premiums for most trucking 9 companies.As a result, our insurance and claims expenses could increase when some of ourcurrent coverages expire on July 31, 2006. If these expenses increase, and weare unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings couldbe materially and adversely affected. TheInternal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed to disallow the tax benefitsassociated with certain sale-and-leaseback transactions. As previously disclosed, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) hasproposed to disallow the tax benefits associated with certainsale-and-leaseback transactions, which we entered into in 1999. Based on eventsoccurring subsequent to December 31, 2004, we established a reserve for acontingent tax liability of $33.6 million at December 31, 2004. The liabilityfor this contingency, which included estimated interest expense, was includedon our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2004, as a long-termliability. We accrued approximately $2.7 million of interest expense during2005 related to this contingency.

We also maintain bulk fuel storageand fuel islands at several of our facilities. If we are involved in a spill orother accident involving hazardous substances, or if we are found to be inviolation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverseeffect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply withapplicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial finesor penalties and to civil and criminal liability. Weoperate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs ofcompliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulationscould have a material adverse effect on our business. The DOT and various state agencies exercise broad powers over ourbusiness, generally governing matters including authorization to engage inmotor carrier service, equipment operation, safety and financial reporting. Weare audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance withvarious safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations.

Themajority of these rule changes had initially been effective January 4, 2004. Thesecollective changes were the most significant changes to driver HOS in more than40 years. In general, the new rules require a driver to take at least eightconsecutive hours in the sleeper berth during a 10-hour off-duty period. Thesenew rules primarily affect short-haul and multiple-stop freight operations and hada minor negative impact on our overall operations and financial results. Effective October 1, 2002, the EPA required that most newly manufacturedheavy-duty tractor engines comply with certain new emission standards. AtDecember 31, 2005, we were operating approximately 5,900 tractors with these2002 rule-complaint engines. In addition to higher initial purchase prices,these tractors have also experienced an average 4% to 5% reduction in fuelefficiency. Effective with model-year 2007 tractors, the EPA has mandated evenlower emission standards for newly manufactured heavy-duty tractor engines. Weare planning our new equipment purchases to 10 accommodatethese new standards, but also to allow adequate time for testing of the newengines. We are unable to predict the impact these new standards will have onour future operations and business results. Rapidchanges in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results. Fuel and fuel taxes currently represent our third-largest generalexpense category. During the past several years, fuel cost per gallon hasvaried significantly, with prices at times changing as much as $.20 to $.25 pergallon between consecutive months. We have a fuel surcharge revenue program inplace with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us torecover the majority of higher fuel costs. Most of these programs automaticallyadjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel. However, there can be timingdifferences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuelsurcharges billed to our customers. In addition, we incur additional costs whenfuel prices rise that cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idledduring cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot bebilled to customers. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel couldhave a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. As ofDecember 31, 2005, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce ourexposure to fuel price fluctuations. "
