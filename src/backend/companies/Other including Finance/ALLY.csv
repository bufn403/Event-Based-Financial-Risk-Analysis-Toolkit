14,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2024-02-20,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We describe certain of these risks and uncertainties in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the Regulation and Supervision section in Part I, Item 1 of this report, the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to Regulation and SupervisionThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry SROs that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. This regulatory and supervisory oversight is designed to protect public and private interests—such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors generally—that may not always be aligned with those of our stockholders or non-deposit creditors. At any given time, we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations, and other inquiries. Refer to the risk factor below titled We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.While the scope, intensity, and focus of governmental oversight can vary from time to time, we expect a highly demanding environment for the foreseeable future. In recent years, regulatory and other governmental agencies have taken a host of actions that create more challenging and volatile financial and operating conditions for financial-services companies, including through formal rulemakings that change the law or interpretations of the law, supervisory expectations and public statements that are designed to informally compel changes in industry practices, and more aggressive approaches to enforcement that are accompanied by increasingly severe penalties. These actions are comprehensive in their coverage, such as rulemakings on climate-related disclosures, cybersecurity risk governance (including incident disclosure), CRA reform, credit-card fees (such as the CFPB’s proposed rule to cap late fees), and personal-financial-data rights as well as guidance and statements on mergers and acquisitions, regulatory capital, resolution planning, automotive financing and insurance, fees for financial services, and UDAAP. Further, following the failures of three large banks in 2023, banking regulators have proposed changes, or indicated the potential for changes, regarding the regulation and supervision of banking organizations, in particular those, such as Ally, with $100 billion or more in assets. The introduction of new or more stringent regulatory requirements, as well as heightened supervisory expectations, could require Ally to maintain additional capital or liquidity or incur significant expenses. Governmental oversight of this kind may increase our operating costs or reduce our revenues, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, alter the investments we may make, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and operations, increase our litigation and regulatory costs, and enhance the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products. We continue to devote substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory-change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which—whether successful or not—also may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.Ally has elected to be treated as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial and related activities—including securities, advisory, insurance, and merchant-banking activities—beyond the business of banking. Ally and Ally Bank are subject to ongoing requirements for Ally to qualify as an FHC. If a BHC or any of its insured depository institutions is found not to be well capitalized or well managed, as defined under applicable law, the BHC can be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial and related activities permitted for FHCs, including the ability to acquire companies engaged in those activities, and can be required to discontinue these activities or even divest any of its insured depository institutions. In addition, if an insured-depository-institution subsidiary of a BHC fails to achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the CRA, the ability of the BHC to expand its financial and related activities or make acquisitions could be restricted.In connection with their continuous supervision and examinations of us, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, the NYDFS, or other regulatory agencies may explicitly or implicitly require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to comply with the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. The financial-services industry continues to face scrutiny from supervisory authorities in the examination process, including through an increasing use of horizontal reviews from a broader industry perspective as well as strict enforcement of laws at federal, state, and local levels—particularly in connection with business and other practices that may harm or appear to harm consumers and compliance with anti-money-laundering, sanctions, and related laws. Because of the regulatory and supervisory framework, financial institutions often are less inclined to litigate with governmental authorities. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settling proceedings or investigations and the severity of other terms of regulatory settlements are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms, including admissions of wrongdoing and the imposition of monitors, as part of settlements. Supervisory actions could entail significant restrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business or make acquisitions, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Enforcement and other supervisory actions also can result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties or injunctions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of customer or investor confidence, and a prior enforcement action may also increase the risk that regulators and governmental authorities pursue formal enforcement actions in connection 23Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kwith the resolution of an inquiry or investigation, even if unrelated to the prior enforcement action. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time. As a result, any enforcement or other supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.Our regulatory and supervisory environments—whether at federal, state, or local levels—are not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, and other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively, or that applicable laws, or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, may overlap, diverge or conflict across jurisdictions. Changes in the regulatory and supervisory environments could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, enhancing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, and restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities. Further, our noncompliance with applicable laws—whether as a result of changes in interpretation or enforcement, system or human errors, or otherwise and, in some cases, regardless of whether noncompliance was inadvertent—could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of enforcement and other supervisory actions or private litigation.Our ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.Much of our business and operations is conducted by Ally Bank, which is a direct bank with no branch network, and a primary component of our business strategy is its continued growth. This growth includes expanding our consumer and commercial lending and increasing our deposit customers and balances while optimizing our cost of funds. If regulatory agencies raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it, we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities—such as unsecured funding in the capital markets—could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.We are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.We are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB. Under the Tailoring Rules, Ally is a Category IV firm and, as such, is generally subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and is required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. The FRB may require us to revise and resubmit our capital plan in specified circumstances, including if the FRB determines that our capital plan is incomplete, our capital plan or internal capital adequacy process contains material weaknesses, or there has been, or will likely be, a material change in our risk profile (including a material change in our business strategy or any risk exposure), financial condition, or corporate structure. While a resubmission is pending, without prior approval of the FRB, we would generally be prohibited from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions.Depending on the circumstances, to satisfy the FRB in its review of our capital plan, we may be required to further cease or limit capital distributions or to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to stockholders. The FRB also may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities. Any of these developments, including the mere fact of being required by the FRB to revise or resubmit our capital plan and especially if unique to us or a group of firms like us, may damage our reputation and result in a loss of customer or investor confidence.Further, we may be required to raise capital if we are at risk of failing to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital ratios or related supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, changes in accounting standards that affect capital (such as CECL), or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when we are not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer or investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Even if we are able to raise capital but do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.The enhanced prudential standards also require Ally, as a Category IV firm, to conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests, to maintain a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net stressed cash outflows over a 30-day planning horizon, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures. These enhanced liquidity standards could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.24Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is intense. Further, recent increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, more intense competition in deposit pricing and with respect to non-deposit financial products. Ally Bank does not have a branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other digital channels, from other business lines including customers of Ally Invest, and through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Our brokered deposits totaled $11.0 billion at December 31, 2023, which represented 7.1% of total deposit liabilities. In addition, our ability to maintain, grow, or favorably price deposits may be constrained by our focus on online and mobile banking, gaps in our product and service offerings, changes in consumer trends, our smaller scale relative to other financial institutions, competition from fintech companies and emerging financial-services providers, any failures or deterioration in our customer service, or any loss of confidence in our brand or our business. Our level and cost of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth, and by changes in monetary or fiscal policies that influence deposit or other interest rates. Perceptions of our existing and future financial strength or the financial strength of the financial-services industry generally, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size and cost of our deposit base. For example, Ally Bank could be subject to sudden withdrawals of deposits, including as a result of negative media coverage, which may be spread through social media, regarding us or the financial services industry generally. Online and mobile banking have made it easier for customers to withdraw their deposits or transfer funds to other accounts with short notice. This may make retaining deposits during periods of stress more difficult. In addition, depositors of certain types of deposits, such as uninsured or uncollateralized deposits, may be more likely to withdraw their deposits or do so more quickly. Any such withdrawals could result in higher funding costs for us as we lose a lower cost source of funding, and significant unanticipated withdrawals could materially and adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Approximately 93% of total deposits at Ally Bank, excluding affiliate and intercompany deposits, were FDIC-insured as of December 31, 2023.Requirements under U.S. Basel III that increased the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework or requirements related to long-term debt may adversely affect our business and financial results.Ally and Ally Bank are subject to U.S. Basel III. U.S. Basel III subjects Ally and Ally Bank to minimum risk-based capital ratios (including the dynamic stress capital buffer requirement applicable to Ally and the static capital conservation buffer requirement applicable to Ally Bank). Failure to satisfy these regulatory capital requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.If Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on capital distributions, limitations on acquisitions and new activities, restrictions on our acceptance of brokered deposits, a loss of our status as an FHC, or informal or formal enforcement and other supervisory actions. Such a failure also could irrevocably damage our reputation, prompt a loss of customer and investor confidence, prompt private litigation, and even lead to our resolution or receivership. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as the Basel III endgame or as Basel IV), and on July 27, 2023, the FRB and FDIC issued a proposed rule to implement the Basel Committee’s 2017 standards and make other changes to regulatory capital rules for banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $100 billion or more. Further, on August 29, 2023, the FRB and the FDIC issued a proposed rule that would require Category II through Category IV BHCs and IDIs with $100 billion or more in consolidated assets (as well as their IDI affiliates) to maintain minimum amounts of eligible long-term debt (generally, debt that is unsecured, has a maturity greater than one year from issuance and satisfies additional criteria). The long-term debt proposal, if adopted, would require Ally to maintain more long-term debt than it does currently, which would adversely affect interest expense, net interest income, and net interest margin.Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.A fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries. We also could be negatively impacted by political scrutiny of the financial-services industry in general or our business or operations in particular, whether or not warranted, and by an environment where criticizing financial-services providers or their activities is politically advantageous.Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Refer to the risk factor below, titled The levels of or 25Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kchanges in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition, for more information on how the FRB affects interest rates. These policies and related governmental actions could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations—for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the creditworthiness of our customers, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets.Additionally, changes to tax policies could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the United States and, in part, imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on certain large corporations, such as Ally, and a surcharge on stock repurchases. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect us.If our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to stockholders, or repurchase our common stock.Ally is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in significant part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to stockholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary’s performance, or investments in a subsidiary’s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally’s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally in certain situations. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally’s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).Legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Cybersecurity and data-privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. For example, in 2021 the U.S. banking agencies adopted a final rule requiring us to notify the FRB within 36 hours of any significant computer security incident and have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards applicable to us and our service providers that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. In addition, rulemakings by the SEC and the CFPB have commenced to further regulate cybersecurity risk governance (including incident disclosure) and personal-financial-data rights, respectively. Several states and their governmental agencies, such as the NYDFS, also have adopted or proposed cybersecurity and data-privacy laws. Privacy laws in the State of California, for example, require regulated entities to establish measures to identify, manage, secure, track, produce, and delete personal information.Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy may compel us to enhance or modify our systems and infrastructure, invest in new systems and infrastructure, change our service providers, augment our scenario and vulnerability testing, or alter our business practices or our policies on security, data governance, and privacy. If any of these outcomes were to occur, the complexity and costs of our operations could increase significantly. In addition, if governmental authorities were to conclude that we or our service providers had not adequately implemented laws on cybersecurity and data privacy or had not otherwise met related supervisory expectations, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, reputational damage, or a loss of customer or investor confidence.Our business and financial results may be negatively affected by governmental responses to climate change and related environmental issues.Governments and policymakers at the federal, state and international levels are increasingly focused on climate change and related environmental, social and governance issues, and the potential for climate-related risks to impact the safety and soundness of large financial institutions. For example, in 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risks, which in part directed the U.S. Treasury Secretary to work with other members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to consider a number of actions. More recently, in 2023, the FRB conducted a pilot climate scenario analysis exercise involving six of the nation’s largest banks designed to enhance the ability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate-related financial risks. The results of this exercise may result in future changes to the FRB’s supervisory activities and expectations with respect to Ally. Further, several states in which Ally operates, such as California, have enacted or proposed statutes or regulations addressing climate change and other ESG issues. As a result of these and similar future developments at the federal, state and international levels, we may become subject to different and potentially conflicting requirements and expectations in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Further, it is possible that government responses to actual or perceived changes in climate and related environmental risks, including expectations regarding the purpose of climate scenario analysis, may occur more rapidly than we (or third parties on whom we rely for certain climate- or other sustainability-related information or services) are able to adapt. Our ability to comply with these requirements and expectations, including responses to any inquiry or investigation from a regulatory agency, could have a material adverse effect on our operations, reputation and our financial results.How governments act to address climate and related environmental risks, as well as associated changes in the behavior and preferences of businesses and consumers, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. For example, physical and transition risks associated with climate change could affect households, communities, businesses, and governments, which could impede business activity, affect household incomes, and alter the value of assets and liabilities. These risks may be propagated through the economy and financial 26Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Ksystem, and as a result, the financial sector may experience credit and market risks associated with loss of income, defaults and changes in the values of assets, liquidity risks associated with changing demand for liquidity, operational risks associated with disruptions to infrastructure or other channels, or legal risks. For example, we may change or cease some of our business or operational practices or incur additional capital, compliance, and other costs because of climate- or environmental-driven changes in applicable law or supervisory expectations or due to related political, social, market, or similar pressure.Risks Related to Our BusinessWeak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or continued growth in our nonprime or used vehicle financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is centered around lending and banking with an emphasis on our digital platform, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, operating leases, and securities. As a result, in the ordinary course of business, credit risk is one of our most significant risks.Our business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including in the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, advisory, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could also result from our failing to appropriately underwrite loans and operating leases that we originate or purchase or from our adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans and operating leases increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that adversely affect earnings if debt securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our forecasts of economic conditions, our assessments and monitoring of credit risk, and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. For example, early loss performance in our consumer automotive lending portfolio is trending higher compared to expectations at the time of origination for loans originated in 2022, and more specifically the second half of 2022. In addition, because of CECL, our financial results may be negatively affected as soon as weak or deteriorating economic conditions are forecasted and alter our expectations for credit losses. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.We continue to have exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing and used vehicle financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.7 billion, or approximately 10.3% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2023, as compared to $8.8 billion, or approximately 10.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2022. At December 31, 2023, and 2022, $258 million and $302 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the carrying value of our consumer automotive used vehicle loans before allowance for loan losses was $57.6 billion, or approximately 68.3% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2023, as compared to $55.7 billion, or approximately 67.0% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2022. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive loans or used vehicle financing continue to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree.As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by applicants and other third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, automotive dealers and retailers (in the case of automotive consumer and commercial loans), and service providers (in the case of unsecured personal loans). If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.On January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Under CECL, the allowance is established to reserve for management’s best estimate of expected lifetime losses inherent in our finance receivables and loan portfolio. CECL substantially increased our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity on January 1, 2020.Regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology and models used for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional 27Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kloan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current and future credit risks using existing quantitative and qualitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our finance receivables and loan portfolio, changes to our models or loss estimation techniques including consideration of forecasted economic assumptions, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. For example, increases in factors such as unemployment, or inflation, or decreases in GDP, real personal income, used vehicle values, or home values, beyond what is reflected in our models, could result in an increased inability for consumers to pay their loans, and may result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses. Additionally, our shift to a full credit spectrum consumer automotive finance portfolio over the past several years has resulted in additional increases in our allowance for loan losses, and could result in additional increases in the future. Any increase in the allowance in future periods may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to the risk factor below, titled Our business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed, for more information on how risks associated with our use of models could affect our allowance for loan losses.We have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer’s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, shifting financial and other pressures exerted by manufacturers on dealers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing consumer and regulatory expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. While it is not currently clear how and how quickly these trends may develop, any one or more of them could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.Our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future as a result of intense competition and other factors. The number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 5% as of December 31, 2023, compared to December 31, 2022. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason—including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products and services that meet the needs of the dealers, compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors, or effectively counter the influence that captive automotive finance companies have in the marketplace or the exclusivity privileges that some competitors have with automotive manufacturers—our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.GM and Stellantis dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.While we continue to diversify our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Stellantis dealers and their retail customers still constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2023, 28% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 23% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM dealers and customers, and 53% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 20% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Stellantis dealers and customers. In 2022, 31% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 22% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 55% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 22% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Stellantis dealers and customers. A significant adverse change in GM’s or Stellantis’ business—including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Stellantis vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Stellantis vehicles, GM’s or Stellantis’ relationships with its key suppliers, or the rate or volume of recalls of GM or Stellantis vehicles—could negatively impact our GM and Stellantis dealer and retail customer bases and the value of collateral securing our extensions of credit to them. Any future reductions in GM and Stellantis business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.Our business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by the sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted, in turn, by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income and savings, interest rates, credit availability, inventory levels, customer preferences, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. A meaningful rise in inflation during 2021 28Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kand through 2022 prompted the FRB to sharply increase the federal funds rate during 2022 and 2023. The current level and trajectory of borrowing costs has adversely affect demand for new and used vehicles and could continue to do so in the future. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Vehicle loans and operating leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future beyond our expectation.During the year ended December 31, 2023, approximately 58% of our average earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or operating leases and related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, the levels of demand for vehicle ownership and use, relative market prices for new and used vehicles, perceived vehicle quality, the shift from gasoline to electric vehicles, overall vehicle prices, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income and savings, interest rates, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers, dealers, and retailers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive operating lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the operating lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle—as reflected in the sale proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination—is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the operating lease transaction than our priced expectations. Our expectation of used vehicle values is also a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and operating lease originations. In stressed economic environments, residual-value risk may be even more volatile than credit risk. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and operating leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic and market conditions (including high or increasing levels of inflation), the political and regulatory environments, business and consumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and expectations about the future (including future changes in interest rates). We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, and events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, increasing the volatility of market rates of interest (including the rate of change), or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices. As of December 31, 2023, we view the balance sheet as being modestly asset-sensitive in the near-term to changes in interest rates, as we expect the assumed repricing of our floating-rate assets and pay-fixed swaps to modestly outpace the assumed repricing of our liabilities, primarily retail deposits. Within a 12-month horizon, we expect the balance sheet to revert to liability sensitive.The levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including by increasing the cost or decreasing the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments, reducing the return on or demand for loans or increasing the prepayment speed of loans, increasing customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults, negatively impacting our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles, and reducing the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies. For example, recent increases in interest rates have resulted in, and could in the future further result in, unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio, which are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognize the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed-income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security.The level of and changes in market rates of interest—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while an accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. A rising interest rate environment can pose different challenges, such as potentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed-income securities. Market volatility in interest rates, including the rate of change, can create particularly difficult conditions. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the FRB increased this benchmark rate on a number of occasions during 2017 and 2018 and began to end its quantitative-easing program and reduce the size of its balance sheet. During 2019, however, the FRB reversed course and reduced the federal funds rate several times and, in March 2020, reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent. A meaningful rise in inflation during 2021 and through 2022 prompted the FRB to sharply increase the federal funds rate more than expected. The federal funds target range reached 5.25–5.50% in 2023. However, FRB officials have signaled that decreases are likely for 29Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K2024 and the markets expect a decrease of more than one percentage point by the end of 2024, based on the implied forward curve. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We rely extensively on third-party service providers in delivering products and services to our customers and otherwise conducting our business and operations, and their failure to perform to our standards or other issues of concern with them could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial results.We seek to distinguish ourselves as a customer-centric company that delivers passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions and that is relentlessly focused on “Doing it Right.” Third-party service providers, however, are key to much of our business and operations, including online and mobile banking, mortgage finance, credit cards, brokerage, customer service, and operating systems and infrastructure. While we have implemented a supplier-risk-management program and can exert varying degrees of influence over our service providers, we do not control them, their actions, or their businesses. Our contracts with service providers, moreover, may not require or sufficiently incent them to perform at levels and in ways that we would choose to act on our own. Despite our supplier-risk-management program, service providers have not always met our requirements and expectations, and no assurance can be provided that in the future they will perform to our standards, adequately represent our brand, comply with applicable law, appropriately manage their own risks (including cybersecurity), remain financially or operationally viable, abide by their contractual obligations, or continue to provide us with the services that we require. In such a circumstance, our ability to deliver products and services to customers, to satisfy customer expectations, and to otherwise successfully conduct our business and operations have been and, in the future, could be adversely affected. In addition, we may need to incur substantial expenses to address issues of concern with a service provider, and if the issues cannot be acceptably resolved, we may not be able to timely or effectively replace the service provider due to contractual restrictions, the unavailability of acceptable alternative providers, or other reasons. Further, regardless of how much we can influence our service providers, issues of concern with them could result in supervisory actions and private litigation against us and could harm our reputation, business, and financial results.We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.As a financial-services company, we are regularly involved in pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters and are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with them. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our business lines and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity—such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer-protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws—and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages. In addition, our income tax positions have been and could continue to be challenged by taxing authorities, and any adverse results could materially impact our business, results of operations, and financial condition.The course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. Other contingent exposures and their ultimate resolution are similarly unpredictable for reasons that can vary based on the circumstances. As a result, we often are unable to determine how or when threatened or pending legal matters and other contingent exposures will be resolved and what losses may be incrementally and ultimately incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued or estimated for those matters and other exposures, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.Our inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or financial results.Skilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation and benefits expense is among our highest costs, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. This risk may be exacerbated due to some of our competitors having significantly greater scale, financial and operational resources, and brand recognition. While we strive to mitigate human-capital risks, our senior executives and other key leaders have deep and broad industry experience and would be difficult to replace without some degree of disruption. For example, in October 2023 our former CEO provided notice of his intent to retire, and the search for a permanent replacement remains ongoing. In addition, our former General Counsel provided his notice of resignation and left the company in December 2023 and our current President of Consumer and Commercial Banking has provided notice of her intent to retire effective July 1, 2024. As a result of these departures, we may face disruption in our business as we seek to identify and transition permanent successors into these roles. In addition, we may experience competition in retaining employees based on remote or other flexible work arrangements, and our ability to attract or retain qualified employees may be adversely affected if our work arrangements are perceived as less favorable than those of our competitors. Continued scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this competition for talent only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel, and retaining talented people in certain areas, has been challenging. Further, growth in our businesses, through acquisitions or otherwise, will further increase our need for skilled employees. If we were to lose 30Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kand find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our management of operational and other risks could suffer, and our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.Our ability to successfully make acquisitions or complete divestitures is subject to significant risks, including the risk that governmental authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.We may from time to time seek to acquire other financial-services companies or businesses or divest an existing business. These acquisitions or divestitures may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all or that approval may not be subject to burdensome conditions. This risk has become more pronounced in recent years as several governmental officials have expressed skepticism about the value of further consolidation in the financial-services industry. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition or divestiture for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition or divestiture could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance. In addition, divestitures can negatively impact our financial results and we may not be able to complete a divestiture on terms favorable to us.Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including inaccurate financial and operational assumptions, incomplete or failed due diligence, lower-than-expected performance, higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, adverse market or other reactions, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, the potential loss of key personnel, and the possibility of litigation and other disputes. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing stockholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Liquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, competitive dynamics, reputational damage, the confidence of depositors in us or the financial-services industry generally, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. For example, in August 2023, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposed rule that would require Category II, III, and IV firms, their large consolidated banks, and other institutions to issue and maintain minimum amounts of long-term debt that is most readily able to absorb losses in a resolution proceeding. Due to the current structure and amount of debt instruments issued by Ally and Ally Bank, this proposal would significantly affect us. Refer to Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Weak business or operational performance, unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries, and other failures to execute our strategic plan also could adversely affect Ally’s liquidity position.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding as our deposits have grown to 88% of our total funding profile as of December 31, 2023, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2023, approximately $1.5 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2024, and approximately $2.5 billion and $149 million is scheduled to mature in 2025 and 2026, respectively. We also utilize secured funding. At December 31, 2023, approximately $2.9 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2024, approximately $1.9 billion is scheduled to mature in 2025, and approximately $1.7 billion is scheduled to mature in 2026. Furthermore, at December 31, 2023, approximately $43.5 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2024, which is not included in the amounts provided above. Additional funding, whether through deposits or borrowings, will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods, and we may not be able to obtain such additional funding at interest rates or on other terms as favorable as the interest rates and other terms on the maturing debt.At times we may rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and bank facilities are generally up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance any existing facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have stabilized following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2007–2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our policies and controls are designed to enable us to maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised or that our policies and controls will be effective in managing our liquidity risk. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and 31Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Koperating lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer and investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.We have a significant amount of indebtedness apart from deposit liabilities. At December 31, 2023, we had approximately $18.3 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $7.1 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness was equal to approximately 8% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2023. We also have the ability to create additional indebtedness.If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, more of our cash flow from operations would need to be allocated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to execute our strategic plan and withstand competitive pressures and could reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.Our non-deposit borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations.The cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.In August 2023, citing macroeconomic trends impacting the banking industry, such as increased costs of funding and rapid tightening in monetary policy, Moody’s downgraded the credit ratings of a number of banks. Additionally, Moody’s downgraded the outlook of a number of banks, including Ally, where the outlook was lowered from Stable to Negative. Any future downgrades to our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations may result in higher non-deposit borrowing costs, reduced access to the banking and capital markets, more restrictive terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, and credit-card products), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, and credit-card products), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of the regulatory and supervisory environments in which we operate, innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, changing customer preferences and consumer and business sentiment, and monetary and fiscal policies. In addition, the emergence, adoption, and evolution of new technologies that affect intermediation, including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain, as well as advances in robotic process automation or artificial intelligence could significantly affect the competition for financial services. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investment in systems or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, continuing to enhance our reputation, or prudently managing risks and expenses.Challenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our businesses are driven by robust economic and market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, high inflation, high interest rates, unfavorable changes in interest rates, declines in household incomes or savings, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, raise our operating and other expenses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans, investment portfolio, and other assets. Further, if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.32Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KGeopolitical conditions, government shutdowns, military conflicts, acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.Geopolitical conditions, government shutdowns, military conflicts (including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the conflicts in the Middle East), acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. For example, military conflicts, acts or threats of terrorism, and political, financial, or military actions taken in response could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us, especially as an intermediary within the financial system. In addition, nation states engaged in warfare or other hostile actions may directly or indirectly use cyberattacks against financial systems and financial-services companies like us to exert pressure on one another or other countries with influence or interests at stake. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. Furthermore, a shutdown of the United States government could adversely affect the economy and increase the risk of economic instability and market volatility, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.For example, the most notable impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations was a significant increase in our provision expense for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily driven by incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, such as unemployment, following the onset of the pandemic. In the case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the current conflicts in the Middle East, security risks as well as increases in fuel and other commodity costs, supply-chain disruptions, and associated inflationary pressures have impacted our business the most. These conditions and events and others like them are highly complex and inherently uncertain, and their effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects in the future cannot be reliably predicted.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.We employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies. Our hedging strategies are not designed to eliminate all interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, and we were adversely impacted from rising interest rates in 2022 and 2023. Refer to the risk factors titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition and Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held for sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses, reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers and retailers, and consumers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods when markets are dislocated or illiquid and when comparable historical data is lacking, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.Market prices for investment securities, nonmarketable equity investments, and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, the usual volume of trading in the asset, shifts in investor sentiment, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions, such as inflation. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. For 33Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kexample, because nonmarketable equity investments are not readily salable in capital markets, their values are particularly susceptible to extreme volatility. For example, in 2022 we recorded a net loss on nonmarketable equity investments of $132 million primarily related to downward adjustments, driven by an impairment in our investment in the parent of BMC (BMC Holdco). Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. For example, in 2022 we recorded $4.0 billion of net unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities within accumulated other comprehensive loss. During 2023, we transferred securities from available-for-sale to held-to-maturity, which reduced our exposure to fluctuations in accumulated other comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2023, the unrealized losses on our available-for-sale and held-to-maturity investment securities within other comprehensive loss was $3.1 billion and $682 million, respectively. Refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the transfer of available-for-sale securities to held-to-maturity. Refer to the risk factor above, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition for more information on risks associated with increases in interest rates.Changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of U.S. GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. For example, the adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020, resulted in a significant increase to our allowance for loan losses in 2020. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial accounting standards issued by the FASB, but not yet adopted by the Company.The financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution or other participant in the financial system could adversely affect us.The financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. The financial system includes other substantial participants as well, including exchanges, central counterparties, government-sponsored enterprises, insurance companies, private-equity funds, hedge funds, family offices, mutual funds, and money-market funds. If any of these institutions or participants were to become or perceived to be unstable, were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time, or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. For example, on November 16, 2023, the FDIC finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to recover the costs to the DIF resulting from the FDIC’s use, in March 2023, of the systemic risk exception to the least-cost resolution test under the FDI Act in connection with the receiverships of SVB and Signature. Because of interrelationships within the financial system, this could occur even if the institution or participant itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or operating lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.We are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states, including public policies that have the effect of drawing financial-services companies into contentious political or social issues, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Negative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.The performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer, especially as an intermediary within the financial system. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, stricter regulatory or supervisory environments, cyber incidents and other security breaches, inabilities to meet customer expectations, political controversies and social trends involving financial-services, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or perceived conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, inappropriate conduct by employees, inadequate corporate governance, and any similar issues affecting our service providers.Our failure to maintain appropriate ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.Governments, investors, customers, and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures. For us and others in the financial-services industry, this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers, counterparties, and service providers with whom we choose to do business. For example, while we have a smaller carbon footprint as a digital financial services company, the majority of our business and operations are connected to the automotive industry. Views about ESG are diverse, dynamic, and rapidly changing, with a number of competing constituencies. If our ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures were perceived to be inadequate or inappropriate by governmental officials, supervisory authorities, investors, customers, or other constituencies with the ability to affect our business and financial results, we could suffer reputational damage, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse effects on our results of operations and prospects.34Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KClimate change could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation.Climate change and the management of climate and related environmental risks is inherently complex. The dynamic nature of climate-related and environmental issues, as well as related science, standards, technology and methodologies, create challenges in evaluating and measuring potential impacts of climate-related physical and transition risks, particularly those that occur over long time horizons. Climate change and the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects due to our concentration in automotive finance and insurance or for entirely different reasons that we cannot yet foresee. For example, we could experience a decline in the demand for and value of used gasoline-powered vehicles that secure our loans to dealers, retailers, and consumers or that we remarket. These physical and transition risks also may have a negative impact on the business, operations, or financial condition of customers, counterparties, and service providers on whom we rely. In addition, climate change may impact the broader economy, including through changes to the production, allocation, and use of energy and disruptions to supply chains. If our strategic or tactical responses to these physical and transition risks are or are perceived to be ineffective or insufficient, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, reputational damage, a loss of customer or investor confidence, difficulty retaining or attracting talented employees, or other harm. Refer to the risk factor above, titled Our business and financial results may be negatively affected by governmental responses to climate change and related environmental issues for more information on risks associated with governmental responses to climate change. If our actual or perceived action or inaction in response to these physical and transition risks are, or are perceived to be, ineffective or insufficient, or if we participate in, or decide not to participate in, certain industries or activities perceived to be associated with causing or exacerbating climate change, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory or government actions, reputational damage, a loss of customer or investor confidence, difficulty retaining or attracting talented employees, or other harm.Risks Related to Our OperationsWe face a wide array of security risks that could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us.Our operating systems and infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, are subject to security risks that are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope, complexity, and frequency. This is due, in part, to the introduction of new technologies, the continued expansion of the use of internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hostile state-sponsored actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We, along with other financial institutions, our service providers, and others on whom we rely, have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, which could include computer viruses, malware, malicious or destructive code, social engineering (including phishing or spear phishing attacks), denial-of-service or denial-of-information attacks, ransomware, identity theft, access violations by employees or vendors, attacks on the personal email of employees, and ransom demands accompanied by threats to expose security vulnerabilities. Risks relating to cyberattacks on our service providers and other third parties, including supply-chain attacks affecting our software and information-technology providers, have been rising as such attacks become increasingly frequent and severe. The development of new technologies, as well as the utilization of decentralized technology infrastructures (such as our increased utilization of cloud computing) and software-defined networks, could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks. Further, the use of artificial intelligence by cybercriminals may increase the frequency and severity of cybersecurity attacks against us or our service providers and others on whom we rely. We, our service providers, and others on whom we rely are also exposed to more traditional security threats to physical facilities and personnel.These security risks could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us, which could be particularly pronounced due to our being a digital financial-services company with a meaningful dependence on service providers. For example, if sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information about us or our customers, employees, or third parties were improperly disclosed, accessed, or destroyed because of a security breach, we could experience severe business or operational disruptions, reputational damage, contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs. As a digital financial-services company and a direct bank with no branch network, we may face heightened pressure to resolve security breaches more expeditiously to prevent or mitigate a loss of depositor or customer confidence, and if we were to fail to do so, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. As threats inevitably evolve, we expect to continue experiencing increased scrutiny of our security frameworks and protocols by supervisory authorities and others and to continue expending significant resources to enhance our defenses, to educate our employees, to monitor and support the defenses established by our service providers and others on whom we rely, and to investigate and remediate incidents and vulnerabilities as they arise or are identified. Even so, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because techniques change frequently, attacks can be launched with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe, and attackers often need few resources to extensively probe and exploit vulnerabilities over lengthy periods of time. A sophisticated breach, moreover, may not be identified until well after the attack has occurred and the damage has been caused.We also could be adversely affected by security risks faced by others. For example, a cyberattack or other security breach affecting a service provider or another entity on whom we rely could negatively impact us and our ability to conduct business and operations just as much as a breach affecting us directly. Further, in such a circumstance, we may not receive timely notice of or sufficient information about the breach or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when the breach is addressed. In addition, a security threat affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and harm us. The mere perception of a security breach involving us or any part of the financial services industry, whether or not true, also could damage our business, operations, or reputation.Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are some of our most significant and yet beyond our control. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.35Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur operating systems or infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, could fail or be interrupted, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.We rely heavily upon communications, data management, and other operating systems and infrastructure—including cloud-based services—to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. For example, during 2021, there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud service providers. Any failure of or interruption in these systems or infrastructure or those of our service providers or others on whom we rely—including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, unplanned or unsuccessful updates to technology, sudden increases in transaction volume, human errors, fraud or other misconduct, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or the commencement of new businesses, energy or similar infrastructure outages, disruptions in communications networks or systems, natural disasters, catastrophic events, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political or social unrest, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, cyberattacks such as computer viruses and malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans—could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans and operating leases, underwriting or processing loan or operating-lease applications, servicing loans and operating leases, accessing online accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, communicating with our customers, managing our investment portfolio, or otherwise conducting our business and operations. These adverse effects could be exacerbated if systems or infrastructure need to be taken offline or meaningfully repaired, if backup systems or infrastructure are not adequately redundant and effective for the conduct of our business and operations, or if technological or other solutions do not exist or are slow to be developed. Further, to the extent that the systems or infrastructure of service providers or others are involved, we may have little or no knowledge, control, or influence over how and when failures or delays are addressed. As a digital financial-services company with a meaningful dependence on service providers, we are susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm as a result of these risks.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure collection, storage, processing, and transmission of this information are critical to our business and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, altered, lost, or stolen or if related operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other damage.Even when a failure of or interruption in operating systems or infrastructure is timely resolved, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. We also could be exposed to contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives, anticipating future technology needs or demands, or maintaining rights or interests in associated intellectual property could adversely affect our business or financial results.As a digital financial-services company and a direct bank with no branch network, we significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to otherwise conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, cloud-based services, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources, and our utilization of artificial intelligence technologies could result in content or analyses that are inaccurate or deficient. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, they are not always implemented on time, within budget, or without negative financial, operational, or customer impact and do not always perform as we or our customers expect, and no assurance can be provided that initiatives in the future will be or will do so. We also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted. Our use of systems and other technologies also depends on rights or interests in the underlying intellectual property, which we or our service providers may own or license. If we or a service provider were alleged or found to be infringing on the intellectual-property rights of another person or entity, we could be liable for significant damages for past infringement, substantial fees for continued use, and deprivation of access for limited or extended periods of time without the practical availability of an alternative.Our enterprise risk-management framework or independent risk-management function may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.We maintain an enterprise risk-management framework that is designed to identify, measure, assess, monitor, test, control, report, escalate, and mitigate the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, operational, information-technology/cyber-security, compliance, and conduct risks. The framework incorporates risk culture and incentives, risk governance and organization, strategy and risk appetite, a material-risk taxonomy, key risk-management processes, and risk capabilities. Our chief risk officer, chief compliance officer, and other personnel who make up our independent risk-management function are responsible for overseeing and implementing the framework. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows. We continuously improve the risk-management framework in response to internal reviews and assessments, evolving industry practices, and changes in business and regulatory expectations. Even with these improvements, however, the framework cannot guarantee that we will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the framework or its design or implementation, the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected. An ineffective risk-management framework or function also could give rise to enforcement and other supervisory actions, damage our reputation, and result in private litigation.36Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, calculate the quantitative portion of our allowance for loan losses, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any flawed models or inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, private litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.Any future dividends on our common stock or establishment of a stock-repurchase program will be determined by our Board in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or establish a stock-repurchase program in the future will be subject to our stress capital buffer requirement and the FRB’s review of our annual capital plan, which are unpredictable. There is no assurance that our Board will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases.It is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so. For example, if any share of Series B Preferred Stock or Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding, unless the dividends for the most recently completed dividend period have been paid in full, or set aside for payment, we will be prohibited, subject to certain specified exceptions, from paying any dividends on or repurchasing our common stock.The market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that the Board does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions that limit the liability of our directors, provide indemnification to our directors and officers, and limit the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common stock in the aggregate.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any BHC, like Ally, or any insured depository institution, like Ally Bank. Any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.37Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K"
12,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2023-02-24,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We describe certain of these risks and uncertainties in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to Regulation and SupervisionThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry SROs that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. This regulatory and supervisory oversight is designed to protect public and private interests—such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors generally—that may not always be aligned with those of our stockholders or non-deposit creditors. At any given time, we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations, and other inquiries. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report and to the risk factor below titled We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.While the scope, intensity, and focus of governmental oversight can vary from time to time, we expect a highly demanding environment for the foreseeable future. Recently, regulatory and other governmental agencies have taken a host of actions that create more challenging and volatile financial and operating conditions for financial-services companies, including through formal rulemakings that change the law or interpretations of the law, supervisory expectations and public statements that are designed to informally compel changes in industry practices, and more aggressive approaches to enforcement that are accompanied by increasingly severe penalties. These actions are comprehensive in their coverage, such as rulemakings on climate-related disclosures, cybersecurity risk governance (including incident disclosure), CRA reform, credit-card fees, and personal-financial-data rights as well as guidance and statements on mergers and acquisitions, regulatory capital, resolution planning, automotive financing and insurance, fees for financial services, and UDAAP. Governmental oversight of this kind may reduce our revenues, limit the types of financial services and products we may offer, alter the investments we may make, affect the manner in which we conduct our business and operations, increase our litigation and regulatory costs, and enhance the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products. We continue to devote substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory-change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which—whether successful or not—also may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.Ally has elected to be treated as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial and related activities—including securities, advisory, insurance, and merchant-banking activities—beyond the business of banking. Ally and Ally Bank are subject to ongoing requirements for Ally to qualify as an FHC. If a BHC or any of its insured depository institutions is found not to be well capitalized or well managed, as defined under applicable law, the BHC can be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial and related activities permitted for FHCs, including the ability to acquire companies engaged in those activities, and can be required to discontinue these activities or even divest any of its insured depository institutions. In addition, if an insured-depository-institution subsidiary of a BHC fails to achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the CRA, the ability of the BHC to expand its financial and related activities or make acquisitions could be restricted.In connection with their continuous supervision and examinations of us, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, the NYDFS, or other regulatory agencies may explicitly or implicitly require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to comply with the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. The financial-services industry continues to face scrutiny from supervisory authorities in the examination process, including through an increasing use of horizontal reviews from a broader industry perspective as well as strict enforcement of laws at federal, state, and local levels—particularly in connection with business and other practices that may harm or appear to harm consumers and compliance with anti-money-laundering, sanctions, and related laws. Because of the regulatory and supervisory framework, financial institutions often are less inclined to litigate with governmental authorities. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settling proceedings or investigations and the severity of other terms of regulatory settlements are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms, including admissions of wrongdoing and the imposition of monitors, as part of settlements. Supervisory actions could entail significant restrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business or make acquisitions, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Enforcement and other supervisory actions also can result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties or injunctions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of customer or investor confidence. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time. As a result, any enforcement or other supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.21Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur regulatory and supervisory environments—whether at federal, state, or local levels—are not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, and other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively. For example, while Congress nullified the CFPB’s guidance about compliance with fair-lending laws in the context of indirect automotive financing, the NYDFS later adopted arguably more far-reaching guidance on the subject. Changes in the regulatory and supervisory environments could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, enhancing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities, and negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our noncompliance with applicable laws—whether as a result of changes in interpretation or enforcement, system or human errors, or otherwise and, in some cases, regardless of whether noncompliance was inadvertent—could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of enforcement and other supervisory actions or private litigation.Our ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.Much of our business and operations is conducted by Ally Bank, which is a direct bank with no branch network, and a primary component of our business strategy is its continued growth. This growth includes expanding our consumer and commercial lending and increasing our deposit customers and balances while optimizing our cost of funds. If regulatory agencies raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it, we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities—such as unsecured funding in the capital markets—could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.We are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.We are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB under the Dodd-Frank Act, as amended by the EGRRCP Act. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Under the Tailoring Rules, Ally is a Category IV firm and, as such, is generally subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and is required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. The FRB may require us to revise and resubmit our capital plan in specified circumstances, including if the FRB determines that our capital plan is incomplete, our capital plan or internal capital adequacy process contains material weaknesses, or there has been, or will likely be, a material change in our risk profile (including a material change in our business strategy or any risk exposure), financial condition, or corporate structure. While a resubmission is pending, without prior approval of the FRB, we would generally be prohibited from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions. For example, in response to the outbreak of COVID-19, the FRB determined that changes in financial markets or the macroeconomic outlook could have a material effect on the risk profiles and financial conditions of firms subject to the capital-plan rule and that, as a result, the firms (including Ally) were required to resubmit capital plans as well as, for a period of time, suspend nearly all common-stock repurchases and restrict common-stock dividends.Depending on the circumstances, to satisfy the FRB in its review of our capital plan, we may be required to further cease or limit capital distributions or to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to stockholders. The FRB also may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities. Any of these developments, including the mere fact of being required by the FRB to revise or resubmit our capital plan and especially if unique to us or a group of firms like us, may damage our reputation and result in a loss of customer or investor confidence.Further, we may be required to raise capital if we are at risk of failing to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital ratios or related supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, changes in accounting standards that affect capital (such as CECL), or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when we are not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer or investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Even if we are able to raise capital but do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.The enhanced prudential standards also require Ally, as a Category IV firm, to conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests, to maintain a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net stressed cash outflows over a 30-day planning horizon, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures. These enhanced liquidity standards could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.22Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is fierce. Further, recent increases in short-term interest rates have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, more intense competition in deposit pricing. Ally Bank does not have a branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other digital channels, from customers of Ally Invest, and through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Brokered deposits totaled $12.6 billion at December 31, 2022, which represented 8.3% of Ally Bank’s total deposits. In addition, our ability to maintain, grow, or favorably price deposits may be constrained by our lack of in-person banking services, gaps in our product and service offerings, changes in consumer trends, our smaller scale relative to other financial institutions, competition from fintech companies and emerging financial-services providers, any failures or deterioration in our customer service, or any loss of confidence in our brand or our business. Our level and cost of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth, and by changes in monetary or fiscal policies that influence deposit or other interest rates. Perceptions of our existing and future financial strength, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size and cost of our deposit base.Requirements under U.S. Basel III that increased the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results.Ally and Ally Bank are subject to U.S. Basel III. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. U.S. Basel III subjects Ally and Ally Bank to minimum risk-based capital ratios (including the dynamic stress capital buffer requirement applicable to Ally and the static capital conservation buffer requirement applicable to Ally Bank). Failure to satisfy these regulatory capital requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.If Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on capital distributions, limitations on acquisitions and new activities, restrictions on our acceptance of brokered deposits, a loss of our status as an FHC, or informal or formal enforcement and other supervisory actions. Such a failure also could irrevocably damage our reputation, prompt a loss of customer and investor confidence, prompt private litigation, and even lead to our resolution or receivership. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as the Basel III endgame or as Basel IV), many of which—if adopted in the United States—could heighten regulatory capital standards. While these revisions were planned for implementation by member countries by January 1, 2023, the U.S. banking agencies have yet to propose rules to do so. At this time, how the revisions will be harmonized and finalized in the United States remains unclear, and no assurance can be provided that they would not further impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects in an adverse way.Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.A fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries. We also could be negatively impacted by political scrutiny of the financial-services industry in general or our business or operations in particular, whether or not warranted, and by an environment where criticizing financial-services providers or their activities is politically advantageous.Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Refer to the risk factor below, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition, for more information on how the FRB affects interest rates. These policies and related governmental actions could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations—for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the creditworthiness of our customers, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets.Additionally, changes to tax policies could have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition. For example, in August 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act was signed into law in the United States and, in part, imposes a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax on certain large corporations, such as Ally, and a surcharge on stock repurchases. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal 23Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kpolicies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect us.If our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to stockholders, or repurchase our common stock.Ally is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in significant part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to stockholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary’s performance, or investments in a subsidiary’s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally’s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally in certain situations. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally’s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).Legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Cybersecurity and data-privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. For example, the U.S. banking agencies have adopted a final rule requiring us to notify the FRB within 36 hours of any significant computer security incident and have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards applicable to us and our service providers that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. In addition, rulemakings by the SEC and the CFPB have commenced to further regulate cybersecurity risk governance (including incident disclosure) and personal-financial-data rights, respectively. Several states and their governmental agencies, such as the NYDFS, also have adopted or proposed cybersecurity and data-privacy laws. Privacy laws in the State of California, for example, require regulated entities to establish measures to identify, manage, secure, track, produce, and delete personal information.Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy may compel us to enhance or modify our systems and infrastructure, invest in new systems and infrastructure, change our service providers, augment our scenario and vulnerability testing, or alter our business practices or our policies on security, data governance, and privacy. If any of these outcomes were to occur, the complexity and costs of our operations could increase significantly. In addition, if governmental authorities were to conclude that we or our service providers had not adequately implemented laws on cybersecurity and data privacy or had not otherwise met related supervisory expectations, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, reputational damage, or a loss of customer or investor confidence.Our business and financial results may be negatively affected by governmental responses to climate change and related environmental issues.Governments are intensely focused on the effects of climate change and related environmental issues. For example, since December 2020, the FRB has become a member of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, created a Supervision Climate Committee to identify and assess financial risks from climate change and to develop a program to ensure the resilience of supervised firms to those risks, and created a Financial Stability Climate Committee to identify, assess, and address climate-related risks to financial stability. The FRB also proposed in December 2022 a high-level framework for the safe and sound management of exposures to climate-related financial risks for large banking organizations, such as Ally, after announcing in September 2022 that six of the nation’s largest banks will participate in a pilot climate-scenario-analysis exercise designed to enhance the ability of supervisors and firms to measure and manage climate-related financial risks. In addition, President Biden has issued an Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risks, which in part directs the U.S. Treasury Secretary to work with other members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to consider a number of actions. Included among them are the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s assessment of climate-related financial risk to the stability of the federal government and the U.S. financial system, facilitation of the sharing of climate-related financial risk data and information among its members and other executive departments and agencies, and issuance of a report on any efforts by its members to integrate consideration of climate-related financial risk in their policies and programs. Further, the SEC has created a Climate and ESG Task Force in the Division of Enforcement, whose purpose includes proactively identifying ESG-related misconduct such as material gaps or misstatements in the disclosure of climate risks.How governments act to mitigate climate and related environmental risks, as well as associated changes in the behavior and preferences of businesses and consumers, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The FRB has announced its development of a program of scenario analysis to evaluate the potential economic and financial risks posed by different climate outcomes, and especially because of our concentration in automotive finance and insurance, this could have the effect of directly or indirectly compelling us to alter our businesses or operations in ways that would be detrimental to our results of operations and prospects. Such a program, moreover, could be followed by an incorporation of climate and related environmental risks into the FRB’s supervisory stress tests, which may negatively impact us and our future capital plans. Further, we may be compelled to change or cease some of our business or operational practices or to incur additional capital, compliance, and other costs because of climate- or environmental-driven changes in applicable law or supervisory expectations or due to related political, social, market, or similar pressure. We also could experience a decline in the demand for and value of used gasoline-powered vehicles that secure our loans to dealers, retailers, and consumers or that we remarket. It is possible as well that 24Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kchanges in climate and related environmental risks, perceptions of them, and governmental responses to them may occur more rapidly than we are able to adapt without disrupting our business and impairing our financial results.Risks Related to Our BusinessWeak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or continued growth in our nonprime or used vehicle financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is centered around lending and banking with an emphasis on our digital platform, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, operating leases, and securities. As a result, in the ordinary course of business, credit risk is one of our most significant risks.Our business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including in the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, advisory, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could also result from our failing to appropriately underwrite loans and operating leases that we originate or purchase or from our adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans and operating leases increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that adversely affect earnings if debt securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our forecasts of economic conditions, our assessments and monitoring of credit risk, and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. For example, early loss performance in our consumer automotive lending portfolio is trending higher compared to expectations at the time of origination for loans originated between the third quarter of 2021 and the second quarter of 2022. In addition, because of CECL, our financial results may be negatively affected as soon as weak or deteriorating economic conditions are forecasted and alter our expectations for credit losses. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.We continue to have exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing and used vehicle financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.8 billion, or approximately 10.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2022, as compared to $8.8 billion, or approximately 11.3% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, $302 million and $294 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the carrying value of our consumer automotive used vehicle loans before allowance for loan losses was $55.7 billion, or approximately 67.0% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2022, as compared to $49.3 billion, or approximately 63.0% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2021. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive loans or used vehicle financing continue to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree.As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by applicants and other third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, automotive dealers and retailers (in the case of automotive consumer and commercial loans), and service providers (in the case of unsecured personal loans). If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.On January 1, 2020, we adopted CECL to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Under CECL, the allowance is established to reserve for management’s best estimate of expected lifetime losses inherent in our finance receivables and loan portfolio. CECL substantially increased our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity on January 1, 2020. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology and models used for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional 25Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kloan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current and future credit risks using existing quantitative and qualitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our finance receivables and loan portfolio, changes to our models or loss estimation techniques including consideration of forecasted economic assumptions, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. For example, our shift to a full credit spectrum consumer automotive finance portfolio over the past several years has resulted in additional increases in our allowance for loan losses, and could result in additional increases in the future. Any increase in the allowance in future periods may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to the risk factor below, titled Our business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed, for more information on how risks associated with our use of models could affect our allowance for loan losses.We have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer’s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, shifting financial and other pressures exerted by manufacturers on dealers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing consumer and regulatory expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. While it is not currently clear how and how quickly these trends may develop, any one or more of them could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.Our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future as a result of intense competition and other factors. The number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 4% as of December 31, 2022, compared to December 31, 2021. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason—including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products and services that meet the needs of the dealers, compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors, or effectively counter the influence that captive automotive finance companies have in the marketplace or the exclusivity privileges that some competitors have with automotive manufacturers—our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.GM and Stellantis dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.While we continue to diversify our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Stellantis dealers and their retail customers still constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2022, 31% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 22% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM dealers and customers, and 55% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 22% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Stellantis dealers and customers. In 2021, 31% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 21% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 48% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 26% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Stellantis dealers and customers. GM, Stellantis, and their captive finance companies compete vigorously with us and could take further actions that negatively impact the amount of business that we do with GM and Stellantis dealers and their customers. A significant adverse change in GM’s or Stellantis’ business—including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Stellantis vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Stellantis vehicles, GM’s or Stellantis’ relationships with its key suppliers, or the rate or volume of recalls of GM or Stellantis vehicles—could negatively impact our GM and Stellantis dealer and retail customer bases and the value of collateral securing our extensions of credit to them. Any future reductions in GM and Stellantis business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by the sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted, in turn, by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income and savings, interest rates, credit availability, inventory levels, customer preferences, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. More recently, automotive manufacturers have continued to experience shortages in their supply of semiconductor chips and other supply chain delays, which have materially 26Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kconstrained their production and sale of new vehicles. Additionally, a meaningful rise in inflation during 2021 and through 2022 prompted the FRB to sharply increase the federal funds rate more than expected during 2022, and FRB officials have signaled that further increases are expected in 2023. The current level and trajectory of borrowing costs could adversely affect demand for new and used vehicles in the near term. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Vehicle loans and operating leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 58% of our average earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or operating leases and related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, the levels of demand for vehicle ownership and use, relative market prices for new and used vehicles, perceived vehicle quality, the shift from gasoline to electric vehicles, overall vehicle prices, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income and savings, interest rates, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers, dealers, and retailers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive operating lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the operating lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle—as reflected in the sale proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination—is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the operating lease transaction than our priced expectations. Our expectation of used vehicle values is also a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and operating lease originations. In stressed economic environments, residual-value risk may be even more volatile than credit risk. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and operating leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic and market conditions (including high or increasing levels of inflation), the political and regulatory environments, business and consumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and expectations about the future (including future changes in interest rates). We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, and events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, increasing the volatility of market rates of interest (including the rate of change), or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices. As of December 31, 2022, we remain liability sensitive and expect increasing interest rates to have a negative impact to our near-term net interest income.The levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including by increasing the cost or decreasing the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments, reducing the return on or demand for loans or increasing the prepayment speed of loans, increasing customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults, negatively impacting our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles, and reducing the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies. For example, recent increases in interest rates have resulted in, and could in the future further result in, unrealized losses in our investment securities portfolio, which are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within the Consolidated Balance Sheet. We recognize the accumulated change in estimated fair value of these fixed-income securities in net income when we realize a gain or loss upon the sale of the security.The level of and changes in market rates of interest—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while an accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. A rising interest rate environment can pose different challenges, such as potentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed-income securities. Market volatility in interest rates, including the rate of change, can create particularly difficult conditions. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the FRB increased this benchmark rate on a number of occasions during 2017 and 2018 and began to end its quantitative-easing program and reduce the size of its balance sheet. During 2019, however, the FRB reversed course and reduced the federal funds rate several times and, in March 2020, reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent. A meaningful rise in inflation during 2021 and through 2022 prompted the FRB to sharply increase the federal funds rate more than expected during 2022, and FRB officials have signaled that further increases are expected in 2023. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.27Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThe discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our business and financial results.LIBOR meaningfully influences market interest rates around the globe. We have exposure to LIBOR-based contracts through a number of our finance receivables and loans, primarily commercial automotive loans and corporate finance loans, as well as certain investment securities and other arrangements.In March 2021, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR’s administrator, announced that U.S. dollar LIBOR settings (other than the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings) will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of the 1-week and 2-month U.S. dollar LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 31, 2021. The LIBOR Act, enacted in March 2022, provides a uniform approach for replacing LIBOR as a reference interest rate in tough legacy contracts—that is, contracts that do not include effective fallback provisions—when LIBOR is no longer published or is no longer representative. Under the LIBOR Act, references to the most common tenors of LIBOR in these contracts will be replaced as a matter of law, without the need to be amended by the parties, to instead reference benchmark interest rates based on SOFR that will be identified by the FRB. The FRB issued a final rule effective February 27, 2023, to implement the LIBOR Act. Ally continues to evaluate the effects of the LIBOR Act and the FRB’s final rule on Ally’s LIBOR-linked contracts, which remain uncertain.Although governmental authorities have endeavored to facilitate an orderly discontinuation of LIBOR, no assurance can be provided that this aim will be achieved or that the use, level, and volatility of LIBOR or other interest rates or the value of LIBOR-based securities will not be adversely affected. Further, the viability of SOFR as an alternative reference rate and the availability and acceptance of other alternative reference rates remain unclear and also may have adverse effects on market rates of interest and the value of securities and other financial arrangements. In addition, although the LIBOR Act and its implementing regulations include safe harbors if the FRB’s SOFR-based replacement rates are selected, these safe harbors are untested, and we could still be exposed to risks associated with disputes and litigation with customers, counterparties, and other market participants in connection with implementing replacement rates for LIBOR. These uncertainties, proposals and actions to resolve them, and their ultimate resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We rely extensively on third-party service providers in delivering products and services to our customers and otherwise conducting our business and operations, and their failure to perform to our standards or other issues of concern with them could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial results.We seek to distinguish ourselves as a customer-centric company that delivers passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions and that is relentlessly focused on “Doing it Right.” Third-party service providers, however, are key to much of our business and operations, including online and mobile banking, mortgage finance, personal lending, credit cards, brokerage, customer service, and operating systems and infrastructure. While we have implemented a supplier-risk-management program and can exert varying degrees of influence over our service providers, we do not control them, their actions, or their businesses. Our contracts with service providers, moreover, may not require or sufficiently incent them to perform at levels and in ways that we would choose to act on our own. Despite our supplier-risk-management program, service providers have not always met our requirements and expectations, and no assurance can be provided that in the future they will perform to our standards, adequately represent our brand, comply with applicable law, appropriately manage their own risks (including cybersecurity), remain financially or operationally viable, abide by their contractual obligations, or continue to provide us with the services that we require. In such a circumstance, our ability to deliver products and services to customers, to satisfy customer expectations, and to otherwise successfully conduct our business and operations have been and, in the future, could be adversely affected. In addition, we may need to incur substantial expenses to address issues of concern with a service provider, and if the issues cannot be acceptably resolved, we may not be able to timely or effectively replace the service provider due to contractual restrictions, the unavailability of acceptable alternative providers, or other reasons. Further, regardless of how much we can influence our service providers, issues of concern with them could result in supervisory actions and private litigation against us and could harm our reputation, business, and financial results.We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.As a financial-services company, we are regularly involved in pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters and are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with them. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our business lines and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity—such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer-protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws—and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages.The course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. Other contingent exposures and their ultimate resolution are similarly unpredictable for reasons that can vary based on the circumstances. As a result, we often are unable to determine how or when threatened or pending legal matters and other contingent exposures will be resolved and what losses may be incrementally and ultimately incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower 28Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kthan any amounts accrued or estimated for those matters and other exposures, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.Our inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or financial results.Skilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation and benefits expense is among our highest costs, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. This risk may be exacerbated due to some of our competitors having significantly greater scale, financial and operational resources, and brand recognition. While we strive to mitigate human-capital risks, our senior executives and other key leaders have deep and broad industry experience and would be difficult to replace without some degree of disruption. In addition, we may experience competition in retaining employees based on remote or other flexible work arrangements, and our ability to attract or retain qualified employees may be adversely affected if our work arrangements are perceived as less favorable than those of our competitors. Continued scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this competition for talent only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel, and retaining talented people in certain areas, such as technology, has been challenging. Further, growth in our businesses, through acquisitions or otherwise, will further increase our need for skilled employees. If we were to lose and find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our management of operational and other risks could suffer, and our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.Our ability to successfully make acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that governmental authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.We may from time to time seek to acquire other financial-services companies or businesses. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all or that approval may not be subject to burdensome conditions. This risk has become more pronounced in the last year as several governmental officials have expressed skepticism about the value of further consolidation in the financial-services industry. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance.Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including inaccurate financial and operational assumptions, incomplete or failed due diligence, lower-than-expected performance, higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, adverse market or other reactions, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, the potential loss of key personnel, and the possibility of litigation and other disputes. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing stockholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Liquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, competitive dynamics, reputational damage, the confidence of depositors in us, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. Weak business or operational performance, unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries, and other failures to execute our strategic plan also could adversely affect Ally’s liquidity position.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding as our deposits have grown, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2022, approximately $2.1 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2023, and approximately $1.5 billion and $2.5 billion is scheduled to mature in 2024 and 2025, respectively. We also utilize secured funding. At December 31, 2022, approximately $2.4 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2023, approximately $2.9 billion is scheduled to mature in 2024, and approximately $1.4 billion is scheduled to mature in 2025. Furthermore, at December 31, 2022, approximately $26.1 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2023, which is not included 29Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kin the amounts provided above. Additional funding, whether through deposits or borrowings, will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods.At times we may rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and bank facilities are generally up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance any existing facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have stabilized following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2007–2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our policies and controls are designed to enable us to maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and operating lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer and investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.We have a significant amount of indebtedness apart from deposit liabilities. At December 31, 2022, we had approximately $18.6 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $7.7 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness was equal to approximately 8% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022. We also have the ability to create additional indebtedness.If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, more of our cash flow from operations would need to be allocated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to execute our strategic plan and withstand competitive pressures and could reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.Our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations.The cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Future downgrades to our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations may result in higher borrowing costs, reduced access to the banking and capital markets, more restrictive terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, point-of-sale personal lending, and credit-card products), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, point-of-sale personal lending, and credit-card products), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of the regulatory and supervisory environments in which we operate, innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, changing customer preferences and consumer and business sentiment, and monetary and fiscal policies. In addition, the emergence, adoption, and evolution of new technologies that affect intermediation, including distributed ledgers such as digital assets and blockchain, as well as advances in robotic process automation could significantly affect the competition for financial services. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investment in systems or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, continuing to enhance our reputation, or prudently managing risks and expenses.30Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KChallenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our businesses are driven by robust economic and market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, high inflation, unfavorable changes in interest rates, declines in household incomes or savings, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, raise our operating and other expenses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans, investment portfolio, and other assets. Further, if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Geopolitical conditions, military conflicts, acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.Geopolitical conditions, military conflicts (including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine), acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. For example, military conflicts, acts or threats of terrorism, and political, financial, or military actions taken in response could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us, especially as an intermediary within the financial system. In addition, nation states engaged in warfare or other hostile actions may directly or indirectly use cyberattacks against financial systems and financial-services companies like us to exert pressure on one another or other countries with influence or interests at stake. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.The most notable impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations was a significant increase in our provision expense for credit losses during the year ended December 31, 2020. This was primarily driven by incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, such as unemployment, following the onset of the pandemic. In the case of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, security risks as well as increases in fuel and other commodity costs, supply-chain disruptions, and associated inflationary pressures have impacted our business the most. These conditions and events and others like them are highly complex and inherently uncertain, and their effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects in the future cannot be reliably predicted.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.We employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies. Our hedging strategies are not designed to eliminate all interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, and we were adversely impacted from rising interest rates in 2022. Refer to the risk factors titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition and Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held for sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses, reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers and retailers, and consumers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods when markets are dislocated or illiquid and when comparable historical data is lacking, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent recovery. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect 31Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kour cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.Market prices for investment securities, nonmarketable equity investments, and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, the usual volume of trading in the asset, shifts in investor sentiment, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions, such as inflation. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. For example, because nonmarketable equity investments are not readily salable in capital markets, their values are particularly susceptible to extreme volatility. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. For example, in 2022 we recorded $4.0 billion of net unrealized losses on our available-for-sale securities within accumulated other comprehensive loss. Refer to the risk factor above, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition for more information on risks associated with increases in interest rates.Changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of U.S. GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. For example, the adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020, resulted in a significant increase to our allowance for loan losses in 2020. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial accounting standards issued by the FASB, but not yet adopted by the Company.The financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution or other participant in the financial system could adversely affect us.The financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. The financial system includes other substantial participants as well, including exchanges, central counterparties, government-sponsored enterprises, insurance companies, private-equity funds, hedge funds, family offices, mutual funds, and money-market funds. If any of these institutions or participants were to become or perceived to be unstable, were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time, or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Because of interrelationships within the financial system, this could occur even if the institution or participant itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or operating lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.We are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states, including public policies that have the effect of drawing financial-services companies into contentious political or social issues, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Negative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.The performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer, especially as an intermediary within the financial system. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, stricter regulatory or supervisory environments, cyber incidents and other security breaches, inabilities to meet customer expectations, political controversies and social trends involving financial-services, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or perceived conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, inappropriate conduct by employees, inadequate corporate governance, and any similar issues affecting our service providers.Our failure to maintain appropriate ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.Governments, investors, customers, and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures. For us and others in the financial-services industry, this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers, counterparties, and service providers with whom we choose to do business. For example, while we have a smaller carbon footprint as a digital financial services company and do not have commercial-lending relationships with a host of sensitive industries (such as those whose products are or are 32Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kperceived to be harmful to the environment or the public health), the majority of our business and operations are connected to the automotive industry. Views about ESG are diverse, dynamic, and rapidly changing, with a number of competing constituencies. If our ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures were considered to be inadequate or inappropriate by governmental officials, supervisory authorities, investors, customers, or other constituencies with the ability to affect our business and financial results, we could suffer reputational damage, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse effects on our results of operations and prospects.Climate change could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation.A prominent aspect of ESG is climate change and the management of climate and related environmental risks. The climate and the environment, however, are extraordinarily complex and impossible to reliably model, and as a result, related physical and transition risks and the scope and severity of their consequences are pervaded by uncertainty. Climate change and the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects due to our concentration in automotive finance and insurance or for entirely different reasons that we cannot yet foresee. These physical and transition risks also may have a negative impact on the business, operations, or financial condition of customers, counterparties, and service providers on whom we rely. In addition, climate change may impact the broader economy, including through changes to the production, allocation, and use of energy and disruptions to supply chains. If our strategic or tactical responses to these physical and transition risks are or are perceived to be ineffective or insufficient, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, reputational damage, a loss of customer or investor confidence, difficulty retaining or attracting talented employees, or other harm. Refer to the risk factor above, titled Our business and financial results may be negatively affected by governmental responses to climate change and related environmental issues for more information on risks associated with governmental responses to climate change.Risks Related to Our OperationsWe face a wide array of security risks that could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us.Our operating systems and infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, are subject to security risks that are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope, complexity, and frequency. This is due, in part, to the introduction of new technologies, the continued expansion of the use of internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hostile state-sponsored actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We, along with other financial institutions, our service providers, and others on whom we rely, have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, which could include computer viruses, malware, malicious or destructive code, social engineering (including phishing or spear phishing attacks), denial-of-service or denial-of-information attacks, ransomware, identity theft, access violations by employees or vendors, attacks on the personal email of employees, and ransom demands accompanied by threats to expose security vulnerabilities. Risks relating to cyberattacks on our service providers and other third parties, including supply-chain attacks affecting our software and information-technology providers, have been rising as such attacks become increasingly frequent and severe. The development of new technologies, as well as the utilization of decentralized technology infrastructures (such as our increased utilization of cloud computing) and software-defined networks, could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks. We, our service providers, and others on whom we rely are also exposed to more traditional security threats to physical facilities and personnel.These security risks could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us, which could be particularly pronounced due to our being a digital financial-services company with a meaningful dependence on service providers. For example, if sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information about us or our customers, employees, or third parties were improperly disclosed, accessed, or destroyed because of a security breach, we could experience severe business or operational disruptions, reputational damage, contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs. As a digital financial-services company and a direct bank with no branch network, we may face heightened pressure to resolve security breaches more expeditiously to prevent or mitigate a loss of depositor or customer confidence, and if we were to fail to do so, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. As threats inevitably evolve, we expect to continue experiencing increased scrutiny of our security frameworks and protocols by supervisory authorities and others and to continue expending significant resources to enhance our defenses, to educate our employees, to monitor and support the defenses established by our service providers and others on whom we rely, and to investigate and remediate incidents and vulnerabilities as they arise or are identified. Even so, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because techniques change frequently, attacks can be launched with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe, and attackers often need few resources to extensively probe and exploit vulnerabilities over lengthy periods of time. A sophisticated breach, moreover, may not be identified until well after the attack has occurred and the damage has been caused.We also could be adversely affected by security risks faced by others. For example, a cyberattack or other security breach affecting a service provider or another entity on whom we rely could negatively impact us and our ability to conduct business and operations just as much as a breach affecting us directly. Further, in such a circumstance, we may not receive timely notice of or sufficient information about the breach or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when the breach is addressed. In addition, a security threat affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and harm us. The mere perception of a security breach involving us or any part of the financial services industry, whether or not true, also could damage our business, operations, or reputation.Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are some of our most significant and yet beyond our control. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.33Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur operating systems or infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, could fail or be interrupted, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.We rely heavily upon communications, data management, and other operating systems and infrastructure—including cloud-based services—to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. For example, during 2021, there were a number of widely publicized cases of outages in connection with access to cloud service providers. Any failure of or interruption in these systems or infrastructure or those of our service providers or others on whom we rely—including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, unplanned or unsuccessful updates to technology, sudden increases in transaction volume, human errors, fraud or other misconduct, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or the commencement of new businesses, energy or similar infrastructure outages, disruptions in communications networks or systems, natural disasters, catastrophic events, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political or social unrest, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, cyberattacks such as computer viruses and malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans—could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans and operating leases, underwriting or processing loan or operating-lease applications, servicing loans and operating leases, accessing online accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, communicating with our customers, managing our investment portfolio, or otherwise conducting our business and operations. These adverse effects could be exacerbated if systems or infrastructure need to be taken offline or meaningfully repaired, if backup systems or infrastructure are not adequately redundant and effective for the conduct of our business and operations, or if technological or other solutions do not exist or are slow to be developed. Further, to the extent that the systems or infrastructure of service providers or others are involved, we may have little or no knowledge, control, or influence over how and when failures or delays are addressed. As a digital financial-services company with a meaningful dependence on service providers, we are susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm as a result of these risks.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure collection, storage, processing, and transmission of this information are critical to our business and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, altered, lost, or stolen or if related operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other damage.Even when a failure of or interruption in operating systems or infrastructure is timely resolved, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. We also could be exposed to contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives, anticipating future technology needs or demands, or maintaining rights or interests in associated intellectual property could adversely affect our business or financial results.As a digital financial-services company and a direct bank with no branch network, we significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to otherwise conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, cloud-based services, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, they are not always implemented on time, within budget, or without negative financial, operational, or customer impact and do not always perform as we or our customers expect, and no assurance can be provided that initiatives in the future will be or will do so. We also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted. Our use of systems and other technologies also depends on rights or interests in the underlying intellectual property, which we or our service providers may own or license. If we or a service provider were alleged or found to be infringing on the intellectual-property rights of another person or entity, we could be liable for significant damages for past infringement, substantial fees for continued use, and deprivation of access for limited or extended periods of time without the practical availability of an alternative.Our enterprise risk-management framework or independent risk-management function may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.We maintain an enterprise risk-management framework that is designed to identify, measure, assess, monitor, test, control, report, escalate, and mitigate the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, operational, information-technology/cyber-security, compliance, and conduct risks. The framework incorporates risk culture and incentives, risk governance and organization, strategy and risk appetite, a material-risk taxonomy, key risk-management processes, and risk capabilities. Our chief risk officer, chief compliance officer, and other personnel who make up our independent risk-management function are responsible for overseeing and implementing the framework. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows. We continuously improve the risk-management framework in response to internal reviews and assessments, evolving industry practices, and changes in business and regulatory expectations. Even with these improvements, however, the framework cannot guarantee that we will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the framework or its design or implementation, the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected. An ineffective risk-management framework or function also could give rise to enforcement and other supervisory actions, damage our reputation, and result in private litigation.34Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, calculate the quantitative portion of our allowance for loan losses, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any flawed models or inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, private litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.Any future dividends on our common stock or changes in our stock-repurchase program will be determined by our Board in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to our stress capital buffer requirement and the FRB’s review of our annual capital plan, which are unpredictable. There is no assurance that our Board will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report.It is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so.The market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that the Board does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions that limit the liability of our directors, provide indemnification to our directors and officers, and limit the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common stock in the aggregate.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any BHC like Ally or any insured depository institution like Ally Bank. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.35Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K"
10,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2022-02-25,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We describe certain of these risks and uncertainties in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to Regulation and SupervisionThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry SROs that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. This regulatory and supervisory oversight is designed to protect public and private interests—such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors generally—that may not always be aligned with those of our stockholders or non-deposit creditors. At any given time, we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations, and other inquiries. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Since the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008, governmental scrutiny of the financial-services industry has intensified, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other laws that govern financial services, and a multitude of related business practices have been altered. While the scope, intensity, and focus of governmental oversight can vary from time to time, we expect to continue devoting substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory-change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.Ally has elected to be treated as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial and related activities—including securities, advisory, insurance, and merchant-banking activities—beyond the business of banking. Ally and Ally Bank are subject to ongoing requirements for Ally to qualify as an FHC. If Ally or Ally Bank is found not to be well capitalized or well managed, as defined under applicable law, we can be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial and related activities permitted for FHCs, including the ability to acquire companies engaged in those activities, and can be required to discontinue these activities or even divest Ally Bank. In addition, if we fail to achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the CRA, our ability to expand these financial and related activities or make acquisitions could be restricted.In connection with their continuous supervision and examinations of us, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, the NYDFS, or other regulatory agencies may explicitly or implicitly require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to comply with the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. The financial-services industry continues to face scrutiny from supervisory authorities in the examination process, including through an increasing use of horizontal reviews from a broader industry perspective, as well as strict enforcement of laws at federal, state, and local levels, particularly in connection with business and other practices that may harm or appear to harm consumers and compliance with anti-money-laundering, sanctions, and related laws. Because of the regulatory and supervisory framework, financial institutions often are less inclined to litigate with governmental authorities. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settling proceedings or investigations and the severity of other terms of regulatory settlements are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms, including admissions of wrongdoing and the imposition of monitors, as part of settlements. Supervisory actions could entail significant restrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business or make acquisitions, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Enforcement and other supervisory actions also can result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties or injunctions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of customer or investor confidence. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time. As a result, any enforcement or other supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.Our regulatory and supervisory environments—whether at federal, state, or local levels—are not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, and other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively. For example, while Congress nullified the CFPB’s guidance about compliance with fair-lending laws in the context of indirect automotive financing, the NYDFS later adopted arguably more far-reaching guidance on the subject. Changes in the regulatory and supervisory environments could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, enhancing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities, and negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our noncompliance with applicable laws—whether as a result of changes in interpretation or enforcement, system or human errors, or otherwise—could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of enforcement and other supervisory actions or private litigation.20Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.A primary component of our business strategy is the continued growth of Ally Bank, which is a direct bank with no branch network. This growth includes expanding our consumer and commercial lending and increasing our deposit customers and balances while optimizing our cost of funds. If regulatory agencies raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it, we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities—such as unsecured funding in the capital markets—could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.We are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.We are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB under the Dodd-Frank Act. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Under the FRB’s tailoring framework for the enhanced prudential standards, Ally is a Category IV firm and, as such, is generally subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and is required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. The FRB may require us to revise and resubmit our capital plan in specified circumstances, including if the FRB determines that our capital plan is incomplete, our capital plan or internal capital adequacy process contains material weaknesses, or there has been, or will likely be, a material change in our risk profile (including a material change in our business strategy or any risk exposure), financial condition, or corporate structure. While a resubmission is pending, without prior approval of the FRB, we would generally be prohibited from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions. In addition, to satisfy the FRB in its review of our capital plan, we may be required to further cease or limit these capital distributions or to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to stockholders. The FRB also may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities. Any of these developments may damage our reputation and result in a loss of customer or investor confidence.Further, we may be required to raise capital if we are at risk of failing to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital ratios or related supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, changes in accounting standards that affect capital (such as CECL), or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when we are not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer or investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Even if we are able to raise capital but do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.The enhanced prudential standards also require Ally, as a Category IV firm, to conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests, to maintain a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net stressed cash outflows over a 30-day planning horizon, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures. These enhanced liquidity standards could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is fierce and has only intensified with the implementation of enhanced capital and liquidity requirements since the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008. Ally Bank does not have a branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other digital channels, from customers of Ally Invest, and through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Brokered deposits totaled $4.7 billion at December 31, 2021, which represented 3.3% of Ally Bank’s total deposits. In addition, our ability to maintain or grow deposits may be constrained by our lack of in-person banking services, gaps in our product and service offerings, changes in consumer trends, our smaller scale relative to other financial institutions, competition from fintech companies and emerging financial-services providers, any failures or deterioration in our customer service, or any loss of confidence in our brand or our business. Our level of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth, and by changes in monetary or fiscal policies that influence deposit or other interest rates. Perceptions of our existing and future financial strength, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base.Requirements under U.S. Basel III that increased the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results.Ally and Ally Bank are subject to U.S. Basel III. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. U.S. Basel III subjects Ally and Ally Bank to minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these 21Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kminimum ratios. Failure to satisfy these regulatory capital requirements would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.If Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on capital distributions, limitations on acquisitions and new activities, restrictions on our acceptance of brokered deposits, a loss of our status as an FHC, or informal or formal enforcement and other supervisory actions. Such a failure also could irrevocably damage our reputation, prompt a loss of customer and investor confidence, generate private litigation, and even lead to our resolution or receivership. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as the Basel III endgame or as Basel IV), many of which—if adopted in the United States—could heighten regulatory capital standards. How these revisions will be finalized in the United States and harmonized with other regulatory proposals and rules (such as the stress capital buffer) is not clear or predictable, and no assurance can be provided that they would not further impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects in an adverse way.Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.A fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries. We also could be negatively impacted by political scrutiny of the financial-services industry in general or our business or operations in particular, whether or not warranted, and by an environment where criticizing financial-services providers or their activities is politically advantageous.Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Refer to the risk factor below, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition, for more information on how the FRB could affect interest rates. These policies and related governmental actions could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations—for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets.Additionally, changes to tax policies could have a material impact to our results of operations and financial condition. For example, the U.S. Congress has recently engaged in significant debate on potential tax reforms, including proposals to increase the federal statutory rate, to impose a surcharge on stock repurchases, and to modify foreign tax credits. In November 2021, the House of Representatives passed the Build Back Better Act, which could adversely affect us if enacted into law. Any increase in the federal statutory rate could result in a significant day-one tax expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and a significant increase in tax expense for future years. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect us.If our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to stockholders, or repurchase our common stock.Ally is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in significant part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to stockholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary’s performance, or investments in a subsidiary’s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally’s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally in certain situations. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally’s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).Legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. For example, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our service providers and that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. In addition, the U.S. banking agencies recently adopted a rule requiring us to notify the FRB within 36 hours of any significant computer security incident. Several states and their governmental agencies, such as the NYDFS, also have adopted or proposed 22Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kcybersecurity laws. Privacy laws in the State of California, for example, require regulated entities to establish measures to identify, manage, secure, track, produce, and delete personal information.Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy may compel us to enhance or modify our systems and infrastructure, invest in new systems and infrastructure, change our service providers, augment our scenario and vulnerability testing, or alter our business practices or our policies on security, data governance, and privacy. If any of these outcomes were to occur, our operational costs could increase significantly. In addition, if governmental authorities were to conclude that we or our service providers had not adequately implemented laws on cybersecurity and data privacy or had not otherwise met related supervisory expectations, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, reputational damage, or a loss of customer or investor confidence.Our business and financial results may be negatively affected by governmental responses to climate change and related environmental issues.Governments are intensely focused on the effects of climate change and related environmental issues. For example, since December 2020, the FRB has become a member of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System, created a Supervision Climate Committee to identify and assess financial risks from climate change and to develop a program to ensure the resilience of supervised firms to those risks, and created a Financial Stability Climate Committee to identify, assess, and address climate-related risks to financial stability. In addition, President Biden has issued an Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risks, which in part directs the U.S. Treasury Secretary to work with other members of the Financial Stability Oversight Council to consider a number of actions. Included among them are the Financial Stability Oversight Council’s assessment of climate-related financial risk to the stability of the federal government and the U.S. financial system, facilitation of the sharing of climate-related financial risk data and information among its members and other executive departments and agencies, and issuance of a report on any efforts by its members to integrate consideration of climate-related financial risk in their policies and programs. Further, the SEC has created a Climate and ESG Task Force in the Division of Enforcement, whose purpose includes proactively identifying ESG-related misconduct such as material gaps or misstatements in the disclosure of climate risks.How governments act to mitigate climate and related environmental risks, as well as associated changes in the behavior and preferences of businesses and consumers, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The FRB has announced its development of a program of scenario analysis to evaluate the potential economic and financial risks posed by different climate outcomes, and especially because of our concentration in automotive finance and insurance, this could have the effect of directly or indirectly compelling us to alter our businesses or operations in ways that would be detrimental to our results of operations and prospects. Such a program, moreover, could be followed by an incorporation of climate and related environmental risks into the FRB’s supervisory stress tests, which may negatively impact us and our future capital plans. Further, we may be compelled to change or cease some of our lending or other business practices or our operational processes because of climate- or environmental-driven changes in applicable law or supervisory expectations or due to related political, social, market, or similar pressure. We also could experience a decline in the demand for and value of used gasoline-powered vehicles that secure our loans to dealers and consumers or that we remarket. It is possible as well that changes in climate and related environmental risks, perceptions of them, and governmental responses to them may occur more rapidly than we are able to adapt without disrupting our business and impairing our financial results.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant.The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in the substantial loss of life, with widespread volatility and deteriorations in household, business, economic, and market conditions, including in the United States where we conduct nearly all of our business. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and on our business, results of operations, and prospects will continue to depend on a number of evolving factors, including:•The duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic. COVID-19 has not yet been contained and could continue to affect significantly more households and businesses or the same households and businesses repeatedly. The duration, severity, and trending of the pandemic remain difficult to predict.•The response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities and the effect on economies and markets. Many governmental and nongovernmental authorities initially responded to COVID-19 by curtailing household and business activity as a containment measure while simultaneously deploying fiscal- and monetary-policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. Although this response slowed the rate of spread of COVID-19 and supported economic stability, the number of cases has risen meaningfully at times and remains volatile, and the potential exists for further resurgences to occur, especially during the cold-and-flu season and in the wake of holidays and other times when social gatherings, travel, or vacations are common. In addition, while monetary policy has remained highly accommodative, the FRB has indicated that this will likely reverse in the near future due to rising inflation. A number of stimulative fiscal programs and actions have expired or been exhausted without renewal as the U.S. government continues to assess whether and how to continue or refine them. Even with vaccination rates increasing, national, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer further disruptions that are lasting.23Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K•The effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties have continued to affect households and businesses differently and unevenly. Many households and businesses have changed their behavior and may continue to do so in response to governmental mandates and advisories that restrict or alter commercial and social behavior and interactions. As a result, our credit, operational, and other risks have at times been elevated and are expected to remain uncertain and volatile for the foreseeable future.The most notable impact of COVID-19 on our results of operations was a significant increase in our provision expense for credit losses during 2020. This was primarily driven by incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic conditions, such as unemployment, following the onset of the pandemic. Given the unpredictability of COVID-19 and its continued direct and indirect effects, our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating results—including expected lifetime credit losses on our loan portfolio—will continue to be subject to meaningful uncertainty. The degree to which our future actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers, counterparties, and third-party service providers and advance our business and the economy generally is unknown. We cannot yet be confident in the sustainability of recent improvements in our business—especially with the most recent resurgence of COVID-19 in much of the United States, the discovery of additional variants of the COVID-19 virus, and ongoing uncertainties around the efficacy and widespread adoption of vaccines and other medical treatments—and the future effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant as time goes on.We are unable to estimate the near-term and ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our business and operations. The pandemic and its ongoing direct and indirect effects could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, additional increases in our allowance for credit losses, impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, heightened volatility in and diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources, further reduced demand for our products and services, and other negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, while we continue to anticipate that our capital and liquidity positions will be sufficient, any future sustained adverse effects may impair these positions, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, and result in downgrades in our credit ratings. The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories also have necessitated changes in the way we and our third-party service providers continue operations—including an extended period of remote-work arrangements—and we may face heightened security, information-technology, operational, and similar risks as a result. The length of time we and our third-party service providers may be required to operate under these circumstances, as well as the potential for conditions to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur, remains unpredictable. All of these risks and uncertainties can be expected to persist at least until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained.Weak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or continued growth in our nonprime or used vehicle financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is centered around lending and banking with an emphasis on our digital platform, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, operating leases, and securities. As a result, in the ordinary course of business, credit risk is one of our most significant risks.Our business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including in the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, advisory, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could also result from our failing to appropriately underwrite loans and operating leases that we originate or purchase or from our adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans and operating leases increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that adversely affect earnings if debt securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our monitoring of credit risk and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. In addition, because of CECL, our financial results may be negatively affected as soon as weak or deteriorating economic conditions are forecasted and alter our expectations for credit losses. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.We continue to have exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing and used vehicle financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.8 billion, or approximately 11.3% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2021, as compared to $8.6 billion, or approximately 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021, and 2020, $294 million and $337 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered 24Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Knonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the carrying value of our consumer automotive used vehicle loans before allowance for loan losses was $49.3 billion, or approximately 63.0% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2021, as compared to $43.0 billion, or approximately 58.3% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2020. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive loans or used vehicle financing continue to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree.As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by applicants and other third parties, such as credit reporting agencies, automotive dealers (in the case of automotive consumer and commercial loans), and service providers (in the case of unsecured personal loans). If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Through the issuance of CECL, the FASB has required the implementation of a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Under this new model, the allowance is established to reserve for management’s best estimate of expected lifetime losses inherent in our finance receivables and loan portfolio. CECL substantially increased our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity on January 1, 2020. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology and models used for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current and future credit risks using existing quantitative and qualitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our finance receivables and loan portfolio, changes to our models or loss estimation techniques including consideration of forecasted economic assumptions, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. For example, our shift to a full credit spectrum consumer automotive finance portfolio over the past several years has resulted in additional increases in our allowance for loan losses, and could result in additional increases in the future. Any increase in the allowance in future periods may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Refer to the risk factor below, titled Our business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed, for more information on how risks associated with our use of models could affect our allowance for loan losses.We have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer’s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, shifting financial and other pressures exerted by manufacturers on dealers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing consumer and regulatory expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. While it is not currently clear how and how quickly these trends may develop, any one or more of them could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.Our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future as a result of intense competition and other factors. The number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 14% as compared to December 31, 2020. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason—including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products and services that meet the needs of the dealers, compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors, or effectively counter the influence that captive automotive finance companies have in the marketplace or the exclusivity privileges that some competitors have with automotive manufacturers—our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.25Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KGM and Stellantis dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.While we continue to diversify our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Stellantis dealers and their retail customers still constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2021, 31% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 21% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM dealers and customers, and 48% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 26% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Stellantis dealers and customers. In 2020, 40% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 22% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 40% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 28% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Stellantis dealers and customers. GM and its captive finance company compete vigorously with us and could take further actions that negatively impact the amount of business that we do with GM dealers and their customers. Additionally, through a recent acquisition, Stellantis has indicated its intention to develop a captive finance company in the United States that could impact the business that we do with Stellantis dealers and their customers. A significant adverse change in GM’s or Stellantis’ business—including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Stellantis vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Stellantis vehicles, GM’s or Stellantis’ relationships with its key suppliers, or the rate or volume of recalls of GM or Stellantis vehicles—could negatively impact our GM and Stellantis dealer and retail customer bases and the value of collateral securing our extensions of credit to them. Any future reductions in GM and Stellantis business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by the sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted, in turn, by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income, interest rates, credit availability, inventory levels, customer preferences, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. More recently, automotive manufacturers have continued to experience shortages in their supply of semiconductor chips and other supply-chain delays, which have materially constrained their production and sale of new vehicles. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Vehicle loans and operating leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 56% of our average earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or operating leases and related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, the levels of demand for vehicle ownership and use, relative market prices for new and used vehicles, perceived vehicle quality, the shift from gasoline to electric vehicles, overall vehicle prices, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income, interest rates, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive operating lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the operating lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle—as reflected in the sale proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination—is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the operating lease transaction than our priced expectations. Our expectation of used vehicle values is also a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and operating lease originations. In stressed economic environments, residual-value risk may be even more volatile than credit risk. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and operating leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic and market conditions, the political and regulatory environments, business and consumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and expectations about the future (including future changes in interest rates). We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, and events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, increasing the volatility of market rates of interest, or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices.26Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThe levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including by increasing the cost or decreasing the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments, reducing the return on or demand for loans or increasing the prepayment speed of loans, increasing customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults, negatively impacting our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles, and reducing the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies.The level of and changes in market rates of interest—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while an accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. A rising interest rate environment can pose different challenges, such as potentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed-income securities. Market volatility in interest rates can create particularly difficult conditions. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the FRB increased this benchmark rate on a number of occasions during 2017 and 2018 and began to end its quantitative-easing program and reduce the size of its balance sheet. During 2019, however, the FRB reversed course and reduced the federal funds rate several times and, in March 2020, reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent. A meaningful rise in inflation during 2021 and into 2022 has prompted FRB officials to signal that increases in the federal funds rate and reductions in the size of the FRB’s balance sheet are expected in the coming year. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.The discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our business and financial results.LIBOR meaningfully influences market interest rates around the globe. We have exposure to LIBOR-based contracts through a number of our finance receivables and loans, primarily commercial automotive loans and corporate finance loans, as well as certain investment securities and other arrangements.In March 2021, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority and the administrator of LIBOR announced that U.S. dollar LIBOR settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after June 30, 2023. The publication of all other LIBOR settings ceased to be provided or ceased to be representative as of December 31, 2021. In November 2020, U.S. banking agencies issued guidance encouraging banks to stop entering new contracts that use U.S. dollar LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as practicable but no later than December 31, 2021. Additionally, in October 2021, U.S. banking agencies emphasized their expectation that supervised institutions with LIBOR exposure continue to progress toward an orderly transition away from LIBOR, including clarification on the meaning of new LIBOR contracts, considerations when assessing appropriateness of alternative reference rates, and expectations for fallback language in new or updated contracts.While governmental authorities have endeavored to facilitate an orderly discontinuation of LIBOR, no assurance can be provided that this aim will be achieved or that the use, level, and volatility of LIBOR or other interest rates or the value of LIBOR-based securities will not be adversely affected. Further, the viability of SOFR as an alternative reference rate and the availability and acceptance of other alternative reference rates remain unclear and also may have adverse effects on market rates of interest and the value of securities and other financial arrangements. These uncertainties, proposals and actions to resolve them, and their ultimate resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.We rely extensively on third-party service providers in delivering products and services to our customers and otherwise conducting our business and operations, and their failure to perform to our standards or other issues of concern with them could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial results.We seek to distinguish ourselves as a customer-centric company that delivers passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions and that is relentlessly focused on “Doing it Right.” Third-party service providers, however, are key to much of our business and operations, including online and mobile banking, mortgage finance, personal lending, credit cards, brokerage, customer service, and operating systems and infrastructure. While we have implemented a supplier-risk-management program and can exert varying degrees of influence over our service providers, we do not control them, their actions, or their businesses. Our contracts with service providers, moreover, may not require or sufficiently incent them to perform at levels and in ways that we would choose to act on our own. Despite our supplier-risk-management program, no assurance can be provided that our service providers will perform to our standards, adequately represent our brand, comply with applicable law, appropriately manage their own risks, remain financially or operationally viable, abide by their contractual obligations, or continue to provide us with the services that we require. In such a circumstance, our ability to deliver products and services to customers, to satisfy customer expectations, and to otherwise successfully conduct our business and operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we may need to incur substantial expenses to address issues of concern with a service provider, and if the issues cannot be acceptably resolved, we may not be able to timely or effectively replace the service provider due to contractual restrictions, the unavailability of acceptable alternative providers, or other reasons. Further, regardless of how much we can influence our service providers, issues of concern with them could result in supervisory actions and private litigation against us and could harm our reputation, business, and financial results.27Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.As a financial-services company, we are regularly involved in pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters and are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with them. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our business lines and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity—such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer-protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws—and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages.The course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. Other contingent exposures and their ultimate resolution are similarly unpredictable for reasons that can vary based on the circumstances. As a result, we often are unable to determine how or when threatened or pending legal matters and other contingent exposures will be resolved and what losses may be incrementally and ultimately incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued or estimated for those matters and other exposures, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.Our inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or financial results.Skilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation and benefits expense is among our highest expenses, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. This risk may be exacerbated due to some of our competitors having significantly greater scale, financial and operational resources, and brand recognition. While we engage in robust succession planning, our senior executives and other key leaders have deep and broad industry experience and would be difficult to replace without some degree of disruption. In addition, we may experience competition in retaining employees based on remote or other flexible work arrangements, and our ability to attract or retain qualified employees may be adversely affected if our work arrangements are perceived as less favorable than those of our competitors. Continued scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this competition for talent only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel, and retaining talented people in certain areas, such as technology, has been challenging. Further, growth in our businesses, through acquisitions or otherwise, will further increase our need for skilled employees. If we were to lose and find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our management of operational and other risks could suffer, and our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.Our ability to successfully make acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that governmental authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.We may from time to time seek to acquire other financial-services companies or businesses. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all or that approval may not be subject to burdensome conditions. This risk has become more pronounced in the last year as several governmental officials have expressed skepticism about the value of further consolidation in the financial-services industry. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance.Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including inaccurate financial and operational assumptions, incomplete or failed due diligence, lower-than-expected performance, higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, adverse market or other reactions, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, the potential loss of key personnel, and the possibility of litigation and other disputes. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing stockholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.28Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Liquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, reputational damage, the confidence of depositors in us, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. Weak business or operational performance, unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries, and other failures to execute our strategic plan also could adversely affect Ally’s liquidity position.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding as our deposits have grown, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2021, approximately $1.1 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2022, and approximately $2.1 billion and $1.5 billion is scheduled to mature in 2023 and 2024, respectively. We also utilize secured funding. At December 31, 2021, approximately $4.8 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2022, approximately $1.5 billion is scheduled to mature in 2023, and approximately $1.3 billion is scheduled to mature in 2024. Furthermore, at December 31, 2021, approximately $32.0 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2022, which is not included in the amounts provided above. Additional funding, whether through deposits or borrowings, will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods.At times we may rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and bank facilities are generally up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance any existing facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have stabilized following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2007–2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our policies and controls are designed to enable us to maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and operating lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer and investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.We have a significant amount of indebtedness apart from deposit liabilities. At December 31, 2021, we had approximately $17.9 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $7.6 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness was equal to approximately 10% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also have the ability to create additional indebtedness.If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, more of our cash flow from operations would need to be allocated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to execute our strategic plan and withstand competitive pressures and could reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.Our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations.The cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Future downgrades to our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations may result in higher borrowing costs, reduced access to the banking and capital markets, more restrictive terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements.29Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThe markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, point-of-sale personal lending, and credit card), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, point-of-sale personal lending, and credit card), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of the regulatory and supervisory environments in which we operate, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, changing customer preferences and consumer and business sentiment, and monetary and fiscal policies. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investment in systems or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, continuing to enhance our reputation, or prudently managing risks and expenses.Challenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our businesses are driven by robust economic and market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, high inflation, unfavorable changes in interest rates, declines in household incomes, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, raise our operating and other expenses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans, investment portfolio, and other assets. Further, if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.Geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Refer to the risk factor above, titled The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant, for more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken in response to terrorism could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us, especially as an intermediary within the financial system. In addition, nation states engaged in warfare or other hostile actions may directly or indirectly use cyberattacks against financial systems and financial-services companies like us to exert pressure on one another or other countries with influence or interests at stake. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.We employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held for sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses, reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers) and often involve complex interactions 30Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kbetween a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods when markets are dislocated or illiquid and when comparable historical data is lacking. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.Market prices for investment securities, nonmarketable equity investments, and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, the usual volume of trading in the asset, shifts in investor sentiment, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions, such as inflation. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. For example, because nonmarketable equity investments are not readily salable in capital markets, their values are particularly susceptible to extreme volatility. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity.Changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of U.S. GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of U.S. GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. For example, the adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020, resulted in a significant increase to our allowance for loan losses in 2020. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial accounting standards issued by the FASB, but not yet adopted by the Company.The financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution or other participant in the financial system could adversely affect us.The financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. The financial system includes other substantial participants as well, including exchanges, central counterparties, government-sponsored enterprises, insurance companies, private-equity funds, hedge funds, family offices, mutual funds, and money-market funds. If any of these institutions or participants were to become or perceived to be unstable, were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time, or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Because of interrelationships within the financial system, this could occur even if the institution or participant itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or operating lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.We are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states, including public policies that have the effect of drawing financial-services companies into contentious political or social issues, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Negative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.The performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer, especially as an intermediary within the financial system. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, stricter regulatory or supervisory environments, cyber incidents and other security breaches, inabilities to meet customer expectations, political controversies and social trends involving financial-services, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or perceived conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, inappropriate conduct by employees, inadequate corporate governance, and any similar issues affecting our service providers.Our failure to maintain appropriate ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.Governments, investors, customers, and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures. For us and others in the financial-services industry, this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers, counterparties, and service providers with whom we choose to do business. For example, while we have a smaller carbon footprint as a digital financial services 31Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kcompany and do not have commercial-lending relationships with a host of sensitive industries (such as those whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to the environment or the public health), the majority of our business and operations are connected to the automotive industry. Views about ESG are diverse, dynamic, and rapidly changing, with a number of competing constituencies. If we were to fail to maintain ESG practices, oversight, and disclosures that are considered appropriate by supervisory authorities, investors, customers, or other constituencies with the ability to affect our business and financial results, we could suffer reputational damage, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse effects on our results of operations and prospects.Climate change could adversely affect our business, operations, and reputation.A prominent aspect of ESG is climate change and the management of climate and related environmental risks. The climate and the environment, however, are extraordinarily complex and impossible to reliably model, and as a result, related physical and transition risks and the scope and severity of their consequences are pervaded by uncertainty. Climate change and the transition to a less carbon-dependent economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects due to our concentration in automotive finance and insurance or for entirely different reasons that we cannot yet foresee. These physical and transition risks also may have a negative impact on the business, operations, or financial condition of customers, counterparties, and service providers on whom we rely. In addition, climate change may impact the broader economy, including through changes to the production, allocation, and use of energy and disruptions to supply chains. If our strategic or tactical responses to these physical and transition risks are or are perceived to be ineffective or insufficient, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, reputational damage, a loss of customer or investor confidence, an exodus of talented employees, or other harm. Refer to the risk factor above, titled Our business and financial results may be negatively affected by governmental responses to climate change and related environmental issues for more information on risks associated with governmental responses to climate change.Risks Related to Our OperationsWe face a wide array of security risks that could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us.Our operating systems and infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, are subject to security risks that are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope, complexity, and frequency, in part, because of the introduction of new technologies, the expanded use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hostile state-sponsored actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We, along with other financial institutions, our service providers, and others on whom we rely, have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, which could include computer viruses, malware, malicious or destructive code, phishing or spear phishing attacks, denial-of-service or denial-of-information attacks, ransomware, identity theft, access violations by employees or vendors, attacks on the personal email of employees, and ransom demands accompanied by threats to expose security vulnerabilities. The development of new technologies, as well as the utilization of decentralized technology infrastructures (such as cloud computing) and software-defined networks, could expose us to additional cybersecurity risks. We, our service providers, and others on whom we rely are also exposed to more traditional security threats to physical facilities and personnel.These security risks could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us, which could be particularly pronounced due to our being a digital financial-services company with a meaningful dependence on service providers. For example, if sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information about us or our customers or employees were improperly disclosed, accessed, or destroyed because of a security breach, we could experience severe business or operational disruptions, reputational damage, contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs. As a digital financial-services company and a direct bank with no branch network, we may face heightened pressure to resolve security breaches more expeditiously to prevent or mitigate a loss of depositor or customer confidence, and if we were to fail to do so, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. As threats inevitably evolve, we expect to continue experiencing increased scrutiny of our security frameworks and protocols by supervisory authorities and others and to continue expending significant resources to enhance our defenses, to educate our employees, to monitor and support the defenses established by our service providers and others on whom we rely, and to investigate and remediate incidents and vulnerabilities as they arise or are identified. Even so, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because techniques change frequently, attacks can be launched with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe, and attackers often need few resources to extensively probe and exploit vulnerabilities over lengthy periods of time. A sophisticated breach, moreover, may not be identified until well after the attack has occurred and the damage has been caused.We also could be adversely affected by security risks faced by others. For example, a cyberattack or other security breach affecting a service provider or another entity on whom we rely could negatively impact us and our ability to conduct business and operations just as much as a breach affecting us directly. Further, in such a circumstance, we may not receive timely notice of or information about the breach or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when the breach is addressed. In addition, a security threat affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and harm us. The mere perception of a security breach involving us or any part of the financial services industry, whether or not true, also could damage our business, operations, or reputation.Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are some of our most significant and yet beyond our control. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.32Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur operating systems or infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, could fail or be interrupted, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.We rely heavily upon communications, data management, and other operating systems and infrastructure—including cloud-based services—to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. Any failure of or interruption in these systems or infrastructure or those of our service providers or others on whom we rely—including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, unplanned or unsuccessful updates to technology, sudden increases in transaction volume, human errors, fraud or other misconduct, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or the commencement of new businesses, energy or similar infrastructure outages, disruptions in communications networks or systems, natural disasters, catastrophic events, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political or social unrest, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, cyberattacks such as computer viruses and malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans—could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans and operating leases, underwriting or processing loan or operating-lease applications, servicing loans and operating leases, accessing online accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, communicating with our customers, managing our investment portfolio, or otherwise conducting our business and operations. These adverse effects could be exacerbated if systems or infrastructure need to be taken offline or meaningfully repaired, if backup systems or infrastructure are not adequately redundant and effective for the conduct of our business and operations, or if technological or other solutions do not exist or are slow to be developed. Further, to the extent that the systems or infrastructure of service providers or others are involved, we may have little or no knowledge, control, or influence over how and when failures or delays are addressed. As a digital financial-services company with a meaningful dependence on service providers, we are especially susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm as a result of these risks.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure collection, storage, processing, and transmission of this information are critical to our business and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost, or stolen or if related operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other damage.Even when a failure of or interruption in operating systems or infrastructure is timely resolved, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. We also could be exposed to contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives, anticipating future technology needs or demands, or maintaining rights or interests in associated intellectual property could adversely affect our business or financial results.Especially as a digital financial-services company and a direct bank with no branch network, we significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to otherwise conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, cloud-based services, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative financial, operational, or customer impact or that, once implemented, they will perform as we or our customers expect. We also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted. Our use of systems and other technologies also depends on rights or interests in the underlying intellectual property, which we or our service providers may own or license. If we or a service provider were alleged or found to be infringing on the intellectual-property rights of another person or entity, we could be liable for significant damages for past infringement, substantial fees for continued use, and deprivation of access for limited or extended periods of time without the practical availability of an alternative.Our enterprise risk-management framework or independent risk-management function may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.We maintain an enterprise risk-management framework that is designed to identify, measure, assess, monitor, test, control, report, escalate, and mitigate the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, operational, information-technology/cyber-security, compliance, and conduct risks. The framework incorporates risk culture and incentives, risk governance and organization, strategy and risk appetite, a material-risk taxonomy, key risk-management processes, and risk capabilities. Our chief risk officer, chief compliance officer, and other personnel who make up our independent risk-management function are responsible for overseeing and implementing the framework. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows. While we continue to evolve our risk-management framework to consider changes in business and regulatory expectations, there can be no assurance that the framework—including its design and implementation—will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the framework or its implementation, the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected. An ineffective risk-management framework or function also could give rise to enforcement and other supervisory actions, damage our reputation, and result in private litigation.33Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, calculate the quantitative portion of our allowance for loan losses, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any flawed models or inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, private litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.Any future dividends on our common stock or changes in our stock-repurchase program will be determined by our Board in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to our stress capital buffer requirement and the FRB’s review of our annual capital plan, which are unpredictable. There is no assurance that our Board will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report.It is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so.The market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that the Board does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions that limit the liability of our directors, provide indemnification to our directors and officers, and limit the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common stock in the aggregate.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any BHC like Ally or any insured depository institution like Ally Bank. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.34Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K"
13,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2021-02-24,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We describe certain of these risks and uncertainties in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to Regulation and SupervisionThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry SROs that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. This regulatory and supervisory oversight is designed to protect public and private interests—such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors generally—that may not always be aligned with those of our stockholders or non-deposit creditors. At any given time, we are involved in a number of legal and regulatory proceedings and governmental and regulatory examinations, investigations, and other inquiries. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In the last decade, governmental scrutiny of the financial-services industry has intensified, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other laws that govern financial services, and a multitude of related business practices have been altered. While the scope, intensity, and focus of governmental oversight can vary from time to time, we expect to continue devoting substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory-change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.Ally has elected to be treated as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial and related activities—including securities, advisory, insurance, and merchant-banking activities—beyond the business of banking. Ally and Ally Bank are subject to ongoing requirements to qualify as an FHC. If Ally or Ally Bank is found not to be well capitalized or well managed, as defined under applicable law, we can be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial and related activities permitted for FHCs, including the ability to acquire companies engaged in those activities, and can be required to discontinue these activities or even divest Ally Bank. In addition, if we fail to achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the CRA, our ability to expand these financial and related activities or make acquisitions could be restricted.In connection with their continuous supervision and examinations of us, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, the NYDFS, or other regulatory agencies may require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to comply with the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. The financial-services industry continues to face scrutiny from supervisory authorities in the examination process, including through an increasing use of horizontal reviews from a broader industry perspective, as well as strict enforcement of laws at federal, state, and local levels, particularly in connection with mortgage-related practices, sales practices and related incentive-compensation programs, and compliance with anti-money-laundering, sanctions, and related laws. In general, the amounts paid by financial institutions in settling proceedings or investigations and the severity of other terms of regulatory settlements are likely to remain elevated. In some cases, governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms, including admissions of wrongdoing and the imposition of monitors, as part of settlements. Supervisory actions could entail significant restrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Enforcement and other supervisory actions also can result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties or injunctions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of customer or investor confidence. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time. As a result, any enforcement or other supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.Our regulatory and supervisory environments—whether at federal, state, or local levels—are not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, and other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively. For example, while Congress nullified the CFPB’s guidance about compliance with fair-lending laws in the context of indirect automotive financing, the NYDFS has since adopted arguably more far-reaching guidance on the subject. Changes in the regulatory and supervisory environments could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, enhancing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities, and negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Further, our noncompliance with applicable laws—whether as a result of changes in interpretation or enforcement, system or human errors, or otherwise—could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of enforcement and other supervisory actions or private litigation.18Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.A primary component of our business strategy is the continued growth of Ally Bank, which is a direct bank with no branch network. This growth includes expanding our consumer and commercial lending and increasing our deposit customers and balances while optimizing our cost of funds. If regulatory agencies raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it, we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities—such as unsecured funding in the capital markets—could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.We are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.We are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB, as required or authorized under the Dodd-Frank Act. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Under the FRB’s tailoring framework for the enhanced prudential standards, Ally is a Category IV firm and, as such, is generally subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle and is required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. The FRB will either object to the plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB—whether due to how well our business and operations are forecasted to perform, how capably we execute our capital-planning process, how acutely the FRB projects severely adverse conditions to be, or otherwise—may prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions, may compel us to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to stockholders, may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities, or may damage our reputation and result in a loss of customer or investor confidence.Further, we may be required to raise capital if we are at risk of failing to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital ratios or related supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, changes in accounting standards that affect capital (such as CECL), or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when we are not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer or investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Even if we are able to raise capital but do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.The enhanced prudential standards also require Ally, as a Category IV firm, to conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests, to maintain a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net stressed cash outflows over a 30-day planning horizon, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures. These enhanced liquidity standards could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is fierce and has only intensified with the implementation of enhanced capital and liquidity requirements in the last decade. Ally Bank does not have a branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other digital channels, from customers of Ally Invest, and through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Brokered deposits totaled $12.6 billion at December 31, 2020, which represented 9.2% of Ally Bank’s total deposits. In addition, our ability to maintain or grow deposits may be constrained by our lack of in-person banking services, gaps in our product and service offerings, changes in consumer trends, our smaller scale relative to other financial institutions, competition from fintech companies and emerging financial-services providers, any failures or deterioration in our customer service, or any loss of confidence in our brand or our business. Our level of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth, and by changes in monetary or fiscal policies that influence deposit or other interest rates. Perceptions of our existing and future financial strength, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base.Requirements under U.S. Basel III that increased the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results.Ally and Ally Bank became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2015. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. U.S. Basel III subjects Ally and Ally Bank to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain more than the full amount of the capital conservation buffer requirement would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay 19Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kdiscretionary bonuses to executive officers. U.S. Basel III also has, over time, imposed more stringent deductions for specified DTAs and other assets and limited our ability to meet regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities or other hybrid securities.If Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on capital distributions, limitations on acquisitions and new activities, restrictions on our acceptance of brokered deposits, a loss of our status as an FHC, or informal or formal enforcement and other supervisory actions. Such a failure also could irrevocably damage our reputation, prompt a loss of customer and investor confidence, generate private litigation, and even lead to our resolution or receivership. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.CECL became effective on January 1, 2020, and substantially increased our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. We are permitted to delay recognizing the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital until after a two-year deferral period, which for us extends through December 31, 2021. Beginning on January 1, 2022, we will be required to phase in 25% of the previously deferred estimated capital impact of CECL, with an additional 25% to be phased in at the beginning of each subsequent year until fully phased in by the first quarter of 2025. The estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital that we will defer and later phase in is calculated as the entire day-one impact at adoption plus 25% of the subsequent change in allowance during the two-year deferral period. In addition, the FRB has announced that, in order to reduce uncertainty, the FRB will maintain its current modeling framework for the allowance for loan losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 cycle. It is not yet clear whether, taken together, these actions by the U.S. banking agencies will mitigate the impact of CECL to a degree that is sufficient for us to sustain appropriate levels of regulatory capital without meaningfully altering our business, financial, and operational plans, including our current level of capital distributions. If the actions are insufficient, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could suffer.In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as Basel IV), many of which—if adopted in the United States—could heighten regulatory capital standards. How these revisions will be finalized in the United States and harmonized with other regulatory proposals (such as the stress capital buffer) is not clear or predictable, and no assurance can be provided that they would not further impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects in an adverse way.Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.A fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries. We also could be negatively impacted by political scrutiny of the financial-services industry in general or our business or operations in particular, whether or not warranted, and by an environment where criticizing financial-services providers or their activities is politically advantageous.Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the monetary policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Refer to the risk factor below, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition, for more information on how the FRB could affect interest rates. These policies and related governmental actions could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations—for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets. Additionally, changes to tax policies could have a material impact to our results of operations and financial condition. An increase in the federal statutory rate could result in a significant day-one tax expense related to the revaluation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and a significant increase in tax expense for future years. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect us.If our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to stockholders, or repurchase our common stock.Ally is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in significant part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to stockholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary’s performance, or investments in a subsidiary’s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally’s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally in certain situations. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a 20Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kgoing concern, Ally’s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).Legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. For example, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our service providers and that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Several states and their governmental agencies, such as the NYDFS, also have adopted or proposed cybersecurity laws targeting these issues. In addition, a comprehensive privacy law has taken effect in the State of California, requiring regulated entities to establish measures to identify, manage, secure, track, produce, and delete personal information.Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy may compel us to enhance or modify our systems and infrastructure, invest in new systems and infrastructure, change our service providers, augment our scenario and vulnerability testing, or alter our business practices or our policies on security, data governance, and privacy. If any of these outcomes were to occur, our operational costs could increase significantly. In addition, if governmental authorities were to conclude that we or our service providers had not adequately implemented laws on cybersecurity and data privacy or had not otherwise met related supervisory expectations, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, reputational damage, or a loss of customer or investor confidence.Our business and financial results may be affected by governmental responses to climate change and related environmental issues.Governments have become increasingly focused on the effects of climate change and related environmental issues. For example, U.S. Treasury Secretary Yellen has identified climate change and its risk to the financial system as a high priority. In addition, the FRB recently became a member of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening the Financial System and, in its Financial Stability Report of November 2020, specifically addressed the implications of climate change for markets, financial exposures, financial institutions, and financial stability.How governments act to mitigate climate and related environmental risks, as well as associated changes in the behavior and preferences of businesses and consumers, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. The FRB, for example, may incorporate these risks into its supervisory stress tests and, in doing so, negatively impact us and our future capital plans at least in part because of our concentration in automotive finance. We also could experience a decline in the demand for and value of used gasoline-powered vehicles that secure our loans to dealers and consumers or that we remarket. Further, we may be compelled to change or cease some of our lending or other business practices or our operational processes because of climate- or environmental-driven changes in applicable law or supervisory expectations or due to related political, social, market, or similar pressure. It is possible as well that changes in climate and related environmental risks, perceptions of them, and governmental responses to them may occur more rapidly than we are able to adapt without disrupting our business and impairing our financial results.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant.The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public-health crisis that has resulted in the substantial loss of life, with widespread volatility and deteriorations in household, business, economic, and market conditions, including in the United States where we conduct nearly all of our business. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and on our business, results of operations, and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors, including:•The duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic. COVID-19 has not yet been contained and could continue to affect significantly more households and businesses. The duration and severity of the pandemic remain difficult to predict.•The response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities and the effect on economies and markets. Many governmental and nongovernmental authorities initially responded to COVID-19 by curtailing household and business activity as a containment measure while simultaneously deploying fiscal- and monetary-policy measures to partially mitigate the adverse effects on individual households and businesses. Although this response slowed the rate of spread of COVID-19 and supported economic stability, the number of cases has risen meaningfully at times and remains volatile, and the potential exists for further resurgences to occur, especially during the cold-and-flu season and in the wake of holidays and other times when social gatherings, travel, or vacations are common. In addition, while monetary policy remains highly accommodative, a number of stimulative fiscal programs and actions have expired or been exhausted without renewal as the U.S. government continues to assess whether and how to continue or refine them. Even with COVID-19 vaccinations having begun, national, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer further disruptions that are lasting.•The effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties are affecting individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. Many, however, have changed their behavior in response to governmental mandates and advisories to restrict or alter commercial and social interactions. As a result, our credit, operational, and other risks have generally been elevated and are expected to remain so—if not increase further—for the foreseeable future.21Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the most notable impact to our results of operations was higher provision expense for credit losses. Our provision expense was $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to $998 million during the same period in 2019, with the increase primarily driven by incremental reserves associated with a deterioration in macroeconomic variables such as unemployment during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the provision for credit losses was also impacted by the adoption of CECL, as further described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. For more detail and further discussion on the impact to our business from COVID-19, refer to the section titled COVID-19 Impacts within the MD&A. Given the unpredictability of COVID-19 and its direct and indirect effects, however, our forecast of macroeconomic conditions and operating results—including expected lifetime credit losses on our loan portfolio—is subject to meaningful uncertainty.As consumers, businesses, and governmental authorities have adapted to evolving conditions, we have observed a recovery in quality loan application volume and resulting booked originations within our Automotive Finance business. For more detail and further discussion, including in connection with our non-automotive businesses, refer to the section titled Significant Business Developments Related to COVID-19 within the MD&A. We cannot yet be confident in the sustainability of these improvements in our business or the trajectory of the macroeconomic outlook—especially with the most recent resurgence of COVID-19 in much of the United States, the discovery of variants of the COVID-19 virus, and ongoing uncertainties around the efficacy, availability, acceptance, and distribution of vaccines and other medical treatments—and the adverse effects on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant as time goes on.Governments have taken necessary and unprecedented steps to partially mitigate the adverse effects of their actions to contain the spread of COVID-19. For example, in late March 2020, the CARES Act was enacted to inject more than $2 trillion of financial assistance into the U.S. economy. The FRB has taken decisive and sweeping actions as well. Since March 15, 2020, these actions have included a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent, a program to purchase an indeterminate amount of Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities, and numerous facilities to support the flow of credit to households and businesses. Still, while monetary policy has remained highly accommodative since the declaration of the pandemic, fiscal stimulus has waned as a meaningful economic rebound developed in the second half of the year and the political environment became more unstable during and after the 2020 elections. While the possibility of further stimulative fiscal-policy measures has become more probable, their potential scope and effect remain highly uncertain. Similarly, while recent developments associated with COVID-19 vaccinations have been promising, the timing and extent of their impact is not predictable. We also have acted swiftly to support our customers with industry-leading relief programs, while prudently managing our credit risk exposure. For more detail on these relief programs and further discussion, refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.The degree to which our actions and those of governments and others will directly or indirectly assist our customers, counterparties, and third-party service providers and advance our business and the economy generally is not yet clear. For example, while our loan-deferral programs may have better positioned customers to make their regular payments to us and enhanced our brand and customer loyalty, our credit performance may still be negatively impacted to the extent that customers depend on a continuation of fiscal-policy measures or other forms of more robust relief. In addition, while the FRB’s accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by supporting economic activity among our customers, this policy and sudden shifts in it may inhibit our ability to grow or sustain net interest income and effectively manage interest-rate and market risks. Further, while extraordinary governmental intervention in the economy and markets has created stability, the scale of these actions inevitably heightens political, reputational, litigation, and similar risks for financial intermediaries like us. We are unable to estimate the near-term and ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on our business and operations. The pandemic and its direct and indirect effects could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, additional increases in our allowance for credit losses, impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, heightened volatility in and diminished access to capital markets and other funding sources, further reduced demand for our products and services, and other negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations, and prospects. In addition, while we continue to anticipate that our capital and liquidity positions will be sufficient, sustained adverse effects may impair these positions, prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements, and result in downgrades in our credit ratings. The COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental mandates and advisories also have necessitated changes in the way we and our third-party service providers continue operations—including an extended period of remote work arrangements—and we may face heightened security, information-technology, operational, and similar risks as a result. The length of time we and our third-party service providers may be required to operate under these circumstances, as well as the potential for conditions to worsen or for significant disruptions to occur, remains unpredictable. All of these risks and uncertainties can be expected to persist at least until the pandemic is demonstrably and sustainably contained, authorities cease curbing household and business activity, and consumer and business confidence recover.Weak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or continued growth in our nonprime or used vehicle financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is centered around lending and banking with an emphasis on our digital platform, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, operating leases, and securities. As a result, in the ordinary course of business, credit risk is our most significant risk.22Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including in the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, advisory, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could also result from our failing to appropriately underwrite loans and operating leases that we originate or purchase or from our adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans and operating leases increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that adversely affect earnings if debt securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our monitoring of credit risk and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. In addition, because of CECL, our financial results may be negatively affected as soon as weak or deteriorating economic conditions are forecasted and alter our expectations for credit losses. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.We continue to have exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing and used vehicle financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.6 billion, or approximately 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2020, as compared to $8.4 billion, or approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019. At December 31, 2020, and 2019, $337 million and $214 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the carrying value of our consumer automotive used vehicle loans before allowance for loan losses was $43.0 billion, or approximately 58.3% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2020, as compared to $39.7 billion, or approximately 54.9% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive loans or used vehicle financing continue to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree.As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by applicants and other third parties, such as automotive dealers and credit reporting agencies. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Through the issuance of CECL, the FASB has required the implementation of a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Under this new model, the allowance is established to reserve for management’s best estimate of expected lifetime losses inherent in our finance receivables and loan portfolio. CECL substantially increased our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity.Regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology and models used for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current and future credit risks using existing quantitative and qualitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our finance receivables and loan portfolio, changes to our models or loss estimation techniques including consideration of forecasted economic assumptions, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. For example, our shift to a full credit spectrum consumer automotive finance portfolio over the past several years has resulted in additional increases in our allowance for loan losses, and could result in additional increases in the future. Any increase in the allowance in future periods may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.23Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer’s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, shifting financial and other pressures exerted by manufacturers on dealers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. While it is not currently clear how and how quickly these trends may develop, any one or more of them could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.Our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future as a result of intense competition and other factors. The number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 6% as compared to December 31, 2019. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason—including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products and services that meet the needs of the dealers, compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors, or effectively counter the influence that captive automotive finance companies have in the marketplace or the exclusivity privileges that some competitors have with automotive manufacturers—our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.While we continue to diversify our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers still constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2020, 40% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 22% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 40% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 28% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Chrysler dealers and customers. In 2019, 46% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 26% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 38% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 27% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Chrysler dealers and customers. GM, Chrysler, and their captive automotive finance companies compete vigorously with us and could take further actions that negatively impact the amount of business that we do with GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers. Further, a significant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s businesses—including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles, GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers, or the rate or volume of recalls of GM or Chrysler vehicles—could negatively impact our GM and Chrysler dealer and retail customer bases and the value of collateral securing our extensions of credit to them. Any future reductions in GM and Chrysler business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by the sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted, in turn, by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income, interest rates, credit availability, inventory levels, customer preferences, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. More recently, automotive manufacturers have reported that a shortage in their supply of semiconductor chips is expected to materially constrain their production of new vehicles through the near term. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Vehicle loans and operating leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 57% of our average earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or operating leases and related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, the levels of demand for vehicle ownership and use, relative market prices for new and used vehicles, perceived vehicle quality, the shift from gasoline to electric vehicles, overall vehicle prices, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income, interest rates, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.24Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive operating lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the operating lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle—as reflected in the sale proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination—is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the operating lease transaction than our priced expectations. Our expectation of used vehicle values is also a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and operating lease originations. In stressed economic environments, residual-value risk may be even more volatile than credit risk. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and operating leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic and market conditions, the political and regulatory environments, business and consumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and expectations about the future (including future changes in interest rates). We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, and events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, increasing the volatility of market rates of interest, or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices.The levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including the following:•increase the cost or decrease the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments;•reduce the return on or demand for loans or increase the prepayment speed of loans;•increase customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults;•negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles; and•reduce the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies.The level of and changes in market rates of interest—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while an accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. A rising interest rate environment can pose different challenges, such as potentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed-income securities. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the FRB increased this benchmark rate on a number of occasions during 2017 and 2018 and began to end its quantitative-easing program and reduce the size of its balance sheet. During 2019, however, the FRB reversed course and reduced the federal funds rate several times, and in March 2020, reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to zero to 0.25 percent. These past actions, and potential future actions, exert upward or downward pressure on interest rates and may create market volatility in interest rates. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Uncertainty about the future of LIBOR may adversely affect our business and financial results.LIBOR meaningfully influences market interest rates around the globe. We have exposure to LIBOR-based contracts through a number of our finance receivables and loans primarily related to commercial automotive loans, corporate finance loans, and mortgage loans, as well as certain investment securities, derivative contracts, and other arrangements. Among our liabilities, we have issued trust preferred securities with an interest rate linked to LIBOR and also have secured facilities, asset-backed securitizations, and brokered certificates of deposit that contain LIBOR-based reference rates.In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the administrator of the LIBOR benchmark announced their intention to consult with the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, LIBOR panel banks, and other official sector bodies on a proposal to extend the publication of certain key USD LIBOR tenors until the end of the second quarter of 2023. Additionally in November 2020, the U.S. banking regulators issued guidance encouraging banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances as soon as practicable, but no later than the end of 2021.No assurance can be provided that the uncertainties around LIBOR or their resolution will not adversely affect the use, level, and volatility of LIBOR or other interest rates or the value of LIBOR-based securities. Further, the viability of SOFR as an alternative reference rate and the availability and acceptance of other alternative reference rates are unclear and also may have adverse effects on market rates of interest and the value of securities and other financial arrangements. These uncertainties, proposals and actions to resolve them, and their 25Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kultimate resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results.We rely extensively on third-party service providers in delivering products and services to our customers and otherwise conducting our business and operations, and their failure to perform to our standards or other issues of concern with them could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial results.We seek to distinguish ourselves as a customer-centric company that delivers passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions and that is relentlessly focused on “Doing it Right.” Third-party service providers, however, are key to much of our business and operations, including online and mobile banking, mortgage finance, brokerage, customer service, and operating systems and infrastructure. While we have implemented a supplier-risk-management program and can exert varying degrees of influence over our service providers, we do not control them, their actions, or their businesses. Our contracts with service providers, moreover, may not require or sufficiently incent them to perform at levels and in ways that we would choose to act on our own. No assurance can be provided that our service providers will perform to our standards, adequately represent our brand, comply with applicable law, appropriately manage their own risks, remain financially or operationally viable, abide by their contractual obligations, or continue to provide us with the services that we require. In such a circumstance, our ability to deliver products and services to customers, to satisfy customer expectations, and to otherwise successfully conduct our business and operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we may need to incur substantial expenses to address issues of concern with a service provider, and even if the issues cannot be acceptably resolved, we may not be able to timely or effectively replace the service provider due to contractual restrictions, the unavailability of acceptable alternative providers, or other reasons. Further, regardless of how much we can influence our service providers, issues of concern with them could result in supervisory actions and private litigation against us and could harm our reputation, business, and financial results.Our operating systems or infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, could fail or be interrupted, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.We rely heavily upon communications, data management, and other operating systems and infrastructure to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. Any failure of or interruption in these systems or infrastructure or those of our service providers or others on whom we rely—including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, unplanned or unsuccessful updates to technology, sudden increases in transaction volume, human errors, fraud or other misconduct, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or the commencement of new businesses, energy or similar infrastructure outages, disruptions in communications networks or systems, natural disasters, catastrophic events, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political or social unrest, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, cyberattacks such as computer viruses and malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans—could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans and operating leases, underwriting or processing loan or operating-lease applications, servicing loans and operating leases, accessing online accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, communicating with our customers, managing our investment portfolio, or otherwise conducting our business and operations. These adverse effects could be exacerbated if systems or infrastructure need to be taken offline or meaningfully repaired, if backup systems or infrastructure are not adequately redundant and effective for the conduct of our business and operations, or if technological or other solutions do not exist or are slow to be developed. Further, to the extent that the systems or infrastructure of service providers or others are involved, we may have little or no knowledge, control, or influence over how and when failures or delays are addressed. As a digital financial-services company with a meaningful dependence on service providers, we are especially susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm as a result of these risks.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure collection, storage, processing, and transmission of this information are critical to our business and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost, or stolen or if related operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other damage.Even when a failure of or interruption in operating systems or infrastructure is timely resolved, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. We also could be exposed to contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.We face a wide array of security risks that could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us.Our operating systems and infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, are subject to security risks that are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope and complexity, in part, because of the introduction of new technologies, the expanded use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hostile state-sponsored actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We, along with other financial institutions, our service providers, and others on whom we rely, have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, which could include computer viruses, malware, malicious or destructive code, phishing or spear phishing attacks, denial-of-service or denial-of-information attacks, ransomware, identity theft, access violations by employees or vendors, attacks on the personal email of employees, and ransom demands accompanied by threats to expose security vulnerabilities. We, our service providers, and others on whom we rely are also exposed to more traditional security threats to physical facilities and personnel.26Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThese security risks could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us, especially as a digital financial-services company with a meaningful dependence on service providers. For example, if sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information about us or our customers or employees were improperly accessed or destroyed because of a security breach, we could experience business or operational disruptions, reputational damage, contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs. As security threats evolve, moreover, we expect to continue expending significant resources to enhance our defenses, to educate our employees, to monitor and support the defenses established by our service providers and others on whom we rely, and to investigate and remediate incidents and vulnerabilities as they arise or are identified. Even so, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because techniques change frequently, and attacks can be launched with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe. A sophisticated breach, moreover, may not be identified until well after the attack has occurred and the damage has been caused.We also could be adversely affected by security risks faced by others. For example, a cyberattack or other security breach affecting a service provider or another entity on whom we rely could negatively impact us and our ability to conduct business and operations just as much as a breach affecting us directly. Even worse, in such a circumstance, we may not receive timely notice of or information about the breach or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when the breach is addressed. In addition, a security threat affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and harm us. The mere perception of a security breach involving us or any part of the financial services industry, whether or not true, also could damage our business, operations, or reputation.Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or financial results.As much if not more than other financial institutions, we significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to otherwise conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative financial, operational, or customer impact or that, once implemented, they will perform as we or our customers expect. We also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted.Our enterprise risk-management framework or independent risk-management function may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.We maintain an enterprise risk-management framework that is designed to identify, measure, assess, monitor, test, control, report, escalate, and mitigate the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, operational, information-technology/security, compliance, and conduct risks. The framework incorporates risk culture and incentives, risk governance and organization, strategy and risk appetite, a material-risk taxonomy, key risk-management processes, and risk capabilities. Our chief risk officer, chief compliance officer, and other personnel who make up our independent risk-management function are responsible for overseeing and implementing the framework. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows. While we continue to evolve our risk-management framework to consider changes in business and regulatory expectations, there can be no assurance that the framework—including its design and implementation—will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the framework or its implementation, the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected. An ineffective risk-management framework or function also could give rise to enforcement and other supervisory actions, damage our reputation, and result in private litigation.We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.As a financial-services company, we are regularly involved in pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters and are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with them. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our business lines and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity—such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer-protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws—and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages.The course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. Other contingent exposures and their ultimate resolution are similarly unpredictable for reasons that can vary based on the circumstances. As a result, we often are unable to determine how or when threatened or pending legal matters and other 27Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kcontingent exposures will be resolved and what losses may be incrementally and ultimately incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued or estimated for those matters and other exposures, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.Our inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or financial results.Skilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation and benefits expense is among our highest expenses, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. This risk may be exacerbated due to some of our competitors having significantly greater scale, financial and operational resources, and brand recognition. Recent scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel. If we were to lose and find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.Our ability to successfully make acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that governmental authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.We may from time to time seek to acquire other financial services companies or businesses. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all or that approval may not be subject to burdensome conditions. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance.Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including inaccurate financial and operational assumptions, incomplete or failed due diligence, lower-than-expected performance, higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, adverse market or other reactions, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, the potential loss of key personnel, and the possibility of litigation and other disputes. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing stockholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Liquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, reputational damage, the confidence of depositors in us, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. Weak business or operational performance, unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries, and other failures to execute our strategic plan also could adversely affect Ally’s liquidity position.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2020, approximately $702 million in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2021, and approximately $1.1 billion and $2.1 billion is scheduled to mature in 2022 and 2023, respectively. We also have obtained short-term funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. We announced the termination of our demand note program and the redemption of all outstanding demand notes on March 1, 2021. At December 31, 2020, approximately $2.1 billion in principal amount of demand notes were outstanding, which is not included in the amount of unsecured debt described above. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2020, approximately $4.5 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2021, approximately $4.9 billion is scheduled to mature in 2022, and approximately $617 million is scheduled to mature in 2023. Furthermore, at December 31, 2020, approximately $41.8 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2021, which is not included in the amounts provided above. Additional funding, whether through deposits or borrowings, will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods.28Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe continue to rely as well on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have stabilized following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2007–2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our policies and controls are designed to enable us to maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and operating lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer and investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.We have a significant amount of indebtedness apart from deposit liabilities. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately $25.1 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $10.0 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 14.7% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020. We also have the ability to create additional indebtedness.If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, more of our cash flow from operations would need to be allocated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to execute our strategic plan and withstand competitive pressures and could reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.Our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations.The cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Future downgrades to our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations may result in higher borrowing costs, reduced access to the banking and capital markets, more restrictive terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, and point-of-sale personal lending), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, and point-of-sale personal lending), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of the regulatory and supervisory environments in which we operate, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, changing customer preferences and consumer and business sentiment, and monetary and fiscal policies. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investment in systems or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, continuing to enhance our reputation, or prudently managing risks and expenses.Challenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our businesses are driven by robust economic and market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, unfavorable changes in interest rates, declines in household incomes, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, raise our operating and other expenses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans, investment portfolio, and other assets. Further, if a 29Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Ksignificant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.Geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, pandemics, and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Refer to the risk factor above, titled The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant, for more information on risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken in response to terrorism could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us, especially as an intermediary within the financial system. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.Significant repurchases or indemnification payments in our securitizations could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase and indemnification obligations in our securitizations. If we were to breach a representation, warranty, or covenant in connection with a securitization, we may be required to repurchase the affected loans or otherwise compensate investors or purchasers for losses caused by the breach. If the scale or frequency of repurchases or indemnification payments were to increase substantially from its present levels, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In such a circumstance, we also could suffer reputational damage, become subject to stricter supervisory scrutiny and private litigation, and find our access to capital and banking markets more limited or more costly.Our business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, calculate the quantitative portfolio of our allowance for loan losses, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any flawed models or inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, private litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.We employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held for sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses, reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods of market dislocation or illiquidity. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.30Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KSignificant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.Market prices for securities and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, shifts in investor sentiment, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity.Changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. For example, the adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020, has resulted in a significant increase to our allowance for loan losses. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial accounting standards issued by the FASB, but not yet adopted by the company.The financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution could adversely affect us.The financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. If any of these institutions were to become or perceived to be unstable, were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time, or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Because of interrelationships within the financial system, this could occur even if the institution itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or operating lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.We are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Negative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.The performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer, especially as an intermediary within the financial system. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, stricter regulatory or supervisory environments, cyber incidents and other security breaches, inabilities to meet customer expectations, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or perceived conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, inappropriate conduct by employees, and inadequate corporate governance.Our failure to maintain appropriate ESG practices and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.Governments, investors, customers, and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures. For us and others in the financial-services industry, this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers, counterparties, and service providers with whom we choose to do business. For example, while we have a relatively smaller carbon footprint as a digital financial services company and do not have commercial-lending relationships with a host of sensitive industries (such as those whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to the environment or the public health), the majority of our business and operations are connected to the automotive industry. Views about ESG are diverse, dynamic, and rapidly changing, and if we were to fail to maintain appropriate ESG practices and disclosures, we could suffer reputational damage, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.Any future dividends on our common stock or changes in our stock-repurchase program will be determined by our Board in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to our stress capital buffer requirement and the FRB’s review of and non-objection to our annual capital plan, which is unpredictable. There is no assurance that our Board will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report.31Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KIt is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so.The market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions:•limiting the liability of our directors and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and•limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common stock in the aggregate.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any BHC like Ally or any insured depository institution like Ally Bank. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.32Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K"
6,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2020-02-25,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We believe that the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to Regulation and SupervisionThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry SROs that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. This regulatory and supervisory oversight is designed to protect public and private interests—such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors—that may not always be aligned with those of our stockholders or non-deposit creditors. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In the last decade, governmental scrutiny of the financial-services industry has intensified, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other laws that govern financial services, and a multitude of related business practices have been altered. While the scope, intensity, and focus of governmental oversight can vary from time to time, we expect to continue devoting substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory-change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.Ally operates as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial and related activities—including securities, advisory, insurance, and merchant-banking activities—beyond the business of banking. To remain eligible to do so, Ally and Ally Bank must remain well capitalized and well managed as defined under applicable law. If Ally or Ally Bank were found not to be well capitalized or well managed, we may be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial and related activities permitted for FHCs and may be required to discontinue these activities or even divest Ally Bank. In addition, if we fail to achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the CRA, our ability to expand these financial and related activities or make acquisitions could be restricted.In connection with their continuous supervision and examinations of us, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, the NYDFS, or other regulatory agencies may require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to comply with the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. Supervisory actions could entail significant restrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Enforcement and other supervisory actions also may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties or injunctions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of customer or investor confidence. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time. As a result, any enforcement or other supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.Our regulatory and supervisory environments are not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, and other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively. For example, while Congress nullified the CFPB’s guidance about compliance with fair-lending laws in the context of indirect automotive financing, the NYDFS has since adopted arguably more far-reaching guidance on the subject. Changes in the regulatory and supervisory environments could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, enhancing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities, and negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Further, noncompliance with applicable laws could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of enforcement and other supervisory actions or private litigation.Our ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.A primary component of our business strategy is the continued growth of Ally Bank, which is a direct bank with no branch network. This growth includes expanding our consumer and commercial lending and increasing our deposit customers and balances while optimizing our cost of funds. If regulatory agencies raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it, we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect on 12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kour business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities—such as unsecured funding in the capital markets—could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.We are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.We are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB, as required or authorized under the Dodd-Frank Act. In May 2018, targeted amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial-services laws were enacted through the EGRRCP Act, including amendments that affect whether and, if so, how the FRB applies enhanced prudential standards to BHCs like us with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. In October 2019, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued final rules implementing these amendments, which became effective on December 31, 2019. The final rules establish four risk-based categories of prudential standards and capital and liquidity requirements for banking organizations with $100 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The most stringent standards and requirements apply to U.S. global systemically important BHCs, which are assigned to Category I. The assignment of other banking organizations to the remaining three categories is based on measures of size and four other risk-based indicators. Under the final rules, Ally is designated as a Category IV firm and, as such, is made subject to supervisory stress testing on a two-year cycle, and is required to submit an annual capital plan to the FRB. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The FRB will either object to the plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB—whether due to how well our business and operations are forecasted to perform, how capably we execute our capital-planning process, how acutely the FRB projects severely adverse conditions to be, or otherwise—may prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions, may compel us to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to stockholders, may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities, or may damage our reputation and result in a loss of customer or investor confidence.Further, we may be required to raise capital if we are at risk of failing to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital ratios or related supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, changes in accounting standards that affect capital (such as CECL), or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when we are not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer or investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Even if we are able to raise capital but do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.The revised enhanced prudential standards also require Ally, as a Category IV firm, to conduct quarterly liquidity stress tests, to maintain a buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets to meet projected net stressed cash outflows over a 30-day planning horizon, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures. These enhanced liquidity standards could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is fierce and has only intensified with the implementation of enhanced capital and liquidity requirements in the last decade. Ally Bank does not have a branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other digital channels, from customers of Ally Invest, and through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Brokered deposits totaled $16.9 billion at December 31, 2019, which represented 14.0% of Ally Bank’s total deposits. In addition, our ability to maintain or grow deposits may be constrained by our lack of in-person banking services, gaps in our product and service offerings, changes in consumer trends, our smaller scale relative to other financial institutions, competition from fintech companies and emerging financial-services providers, any failures or deterioration in our customer service, or any loss of confidence in our brand or our business. Our level of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth, and by changes in monetary or fiscal policies that influence deposit or other interest rates. Perceptions of our existing and future financial strength, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base.Requirements under U.S. Basel III to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results.Ally and Ally Bank became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2015. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. U.S. Basel III subjects Ally and Ally Bank to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation 13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kbuffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. U.S. Basel III also has, over time, imposed more stringent deductions for specified DTAs and other assets and limited our ability to meet regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities or other hybrid securities.If Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on capital distributions as well as acquisitions and new activities, restrictions on our acceptance of brokered deposits, a loss of our status as an FHC, or informal or formal enforcement and other supervisory actions. Such a failure also could irrevocably damage our reputation, prompt a loss of customer and investor confidence, and even lead to our resolution or receivership. Any of these consequences could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Through its adoption of CECL, the FASB has implemented a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. CECL became effective for us on January 1, 2020, and substantially increased our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity. In December 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies approved a final rule to address the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing BHCs and banks, including Ally, to phase in the day-one impact of CECL over a period of three years for regulatory capital purposes. In addition, the FRB announced that, in order to reduce uncertainty, the FRB will maintain its current modeling framework for the allowance for loan losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 cycle. It is not yet clear whether, taken together, these actions by the U.S. banking agencies will mitigate the impact of CECL to a degree that is sufficient for us to sustain appropriate levels of regulatory capital without meaningfully altering our business, financial, and operational plans, including our current level of capital distributions. If the actions are insufficient, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could suffer.In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as Basel IV), many of which—if adopted in the United States—could heighten regulatory capital standards. How these revisions will be finalized in the United States and harmonized with other regulatory proposals (such as the stress capital buffer) is not clear or predictable, and no assurance can be provided that they would not further impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects in an adverse way.Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.A fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries. We also could be negatively impacted by political scrutiny of the financial-services industry in general or our business or operations in particular, whether or not warranted, and by an environment where criticizing financial-services providers or their activities is politically advantageous.Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Refer to the risk factor below, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition, for more information on how the FRB could affect interest rates. These policies and related governmental actions could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations—for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect us.If our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to stockholders, or repurchase our common stock.Ally is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in significant part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to stockholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary’s performance, or investments in a subsidiary’s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally’s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally in certain situations. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally’s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KLegislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. For example, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our service providers and that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Several states and their governmental agencies, such as the NYDFS, also have adopted or proposed cybersecurity laws targeting these issues. In addition, a comprehensive privacy law has taken effect in the State of California, requiring regulated entities to establish measures to identify, manage, secure, track, produce, and delete personal information.Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy may compel us to enhance or modify our systems and infrastructure, invest in new systems and infrastructure, change our service providers, or alter our business practices or our policies on security, data governance, and privacy. If any of these outcomes were to occur, our operational costs could increase significantly. In addition, if governmental authorities were to conclude that we or our service providers had not adequately implemented laws on cybersecurity and data privacy or had not otherwise met related supervisory expectations, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, reputational damage, or a loss of customer or investor confidence.Risks Related to Our BusinessWeak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or continued growth in our nonprime or used vehicle financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is centered around lending and banking, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, operating leases, and securities. As a result, in the ordinary course of business, credit risk is our most significant risk.Our business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including in the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, advisory, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could also result from our failing to appropriately underwrite loans and operating leases that we originate or purchase or from our adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans and operating leases increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that adversely affect earnings if debt securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our monitoring of credit risk and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. In addition, because of CECL, our financial results may be negatively affected as soon as weak or deteriorating economic conditions are forecasted and alter our expectations for credit losses. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.We continue to have exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing and used vehicle financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.4 billion, or approximately 11.6% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to $8.3 billion, or approximately 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2019, and 2018, $214 million and $203 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the carrying value of our consumer automotive used vehicle loans before allowance for loan losses was $39.7 billion, or approximately 54.9% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2019, as compared to $36.3 billion, or approximately 51.5% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2018. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive loans or used vehicle financing continue to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree.As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by applicants and other third parties, such as automotive dealers and credit reporting agencies. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk.15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.Through its adoption of CECL, the FASB has implemented a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Under this new model, the allowance is established to reserve for management’s best estimate of expected lifetime losses inherent in our finance receivables and loan portfolio. This new standard was effective January 1, 2020. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. On the effective date, CECL substantially increased our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity. While the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have taken steps to mitigate the impact of CECL on regulatory capital, it is not yet clear whether these actions will do so to a degree that is sufficient for us to sustain appropriate levels of regulatory capital without meaningfully altering our business, financial, and operational plans, including our current level of capital distributions. Refer to the risk factor above, titled Requirements under U.S. Basel III to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results, for more information about the consequences of our failure to satisfy regulatory capital requirements.Regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current and future credit risks using existing quantitative and qualitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, the implementation of CECL, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our finance receivables and loan portfolio, changes to our loss estimation techniques including consideration of forecasted economic assumptions, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. For example, our shift to a full credit spectrum consumer automotive finance portfolio over the past several years has resulted in additional increases in our allowance for loan losses, and could result in additional increases in the future. Any increase in the allowance in future periods may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.We have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer’s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, shifting financial and other pressures exerted by manufacturers on dealers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. While it is not currently clear how and how quickly these trends may develop, any one or more of them could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.Our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future as a result of intense competition and other factors. The number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 8% as compared to December 31, 2018. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason—including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products and services that meet the needs of the dealers, compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors, or effectively counter the influence that captive automotive finance companies have in the marketplace or the exclusivity privileges that some competitors have with automotive manufacturers—our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.General Motors Company (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (Chrysler) dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.While we continue to diversify our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers still constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2019, 46% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 26% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 38% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 27% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Chrysler dealers and customers. GM, Chrysler, and their captive automotive finance companies compete vigorously with us and could take further actions that negatively impact the amount of business that we do with GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers. Further, a significant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s businesses—including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles, 16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kthe quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles, GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers, or the rate or volume of recalls of GM or Chrysler vehicles—could negatively impact our GM and Chrysler dealer and retail customer bases and the value of collateral securing our extensions of credit to them. Any future reductions in GM and Chrysler business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by the sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted, in turn, by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income, interest rates, credit availability, customer preferences, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Vehicle loans and operating leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2019, approximately 63% of our average earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or operating leases and related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, the levels of demand for vehicle ownership and use, relative market prices for new and used vehicles, perceived vehicle quality, overall vehicle prices, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income, interest rates, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive operating lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the operating lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle—as reflected in the sale proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination—is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the operating lease transaction than our priced expectations. Our expectation of used vehicle values is also a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and operating lease originations. In stressed economic environments, residual-value risk may be even more volatile than credit risk. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and operating leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic and market conditions, the political and regulatory environments, business and consumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and expectations about the future (including future changes in interest rates). We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, and events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, increasing the volatility of market rates of interest, or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices.The levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including the following:•increase the cost or decrease the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments;•reduce the return on or demand for loans or increase the prepayment speed of loans;•increase customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults;•negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles; and•reduce the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies.The level of and changes in market rates of interest—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while an accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. A rising interest rate environment can pose different challenges, such as 17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kpotentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed-income securities. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the FRB increased this benchmark rate on a number of occasions during 2017 and 2018 and began to end its quantitative-easing program and reduce the size of its balance sheet. During 2019, however, the FRB reversed course and reduced the federal funds rate several times. These past actions, and potential future actions, exert upward or downward pressure on interest rates and may create market volatility in interest rates. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Uncertainty about the future of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business and financial results.LIBOR meaningfully influences market interest rates around the globe. We have exposure to LIBOR-based contracts through a number of our finance receivables and loans primarily related to commercial automotive loans, corporate-finance loans, and mortgage loans, as well as certain investment securities, derivative contracts, and other arrangements. Among our liabilities, we have issued trust preferred securities with an interest rate linked to LIBOR and also have secured facilities, asset-backed securitizations, and brokered certificates of deposit that also contain LIBOR-based reference rates.In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicated that the continuation of LIBOR as currently constructed is not guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and whether other rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR.In 2014, the FRB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) to identify best practices for alternative reference rates, identify best practices for contract robustness, develop an adoption plan, and create an implementation plan with metrics of success and a timeline. The ARRC accomplished its first set of objectives and has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the rate that represents best practice for use in certain new U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts. The ARRC also published its Paced Transition Plan, with specific steps and timelines designed to encourage adoption of SOFR. The ARRC was reconstituted in 2018 to help to ensure the successful implementation of the Paced Transition Plan and serve as a forum to coordinate and track planning across cash and derivative products and market participants currently using LIBOR.No assurance can be provided that the uncertainties around LIBOR or their resolution will not adversely affect the use, level, and volatility of LIBOR or other interest rates or the value of LIBOR-based securities. Further, the viability of SOFR as an alternative reference rate and the availability and acceptance of other alternative reference rates are unclear and also may have adverse effects on market rates of interest and the value of securities and other financial arrangements. These uncertainties, proposals and actions to resolve them, and their ultimate resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results.We rely extensively on third-party service providers in delivering products and services to our customers and otherwise conducting our business and operations, and their failure to perform to our standards or other issues of concern with them could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial results.We seek to distinguish ourselves as a customer-centric company that delivers passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions and that is relentlessly focused on “Doing It Right.” Third-party service providers, however, are key to much of our business and operations, including online and mobile banking, mortgage finance, brokerage, customer service, and operating systems and infrastructure. While we have implemented a supplier-risk-management program and can exert varying degrees of influence over our service providers, we do not control them, their actions, or their businesses. Our contracts with service providers, moreover, may not require or sufficiently incent them to perform at levels and in ways that we would choose to act on our own. No assurance can be provided that our service providers will perform to our standards, adequately represent our brand, comply with applicable law, appropriately manage their own risks, remain financially or operationally viable, abide by their contractual obligations, or continue to provide us with the services that we require. In such a circumstance, our ability to deliver products and services to customers, to satisfy customer expectations, and to otherwise successfully conduct our business and operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we may need to incur substantial expenses to address issues of concern with a service provider, and even if the issues cannot be acceptably resolved, we may not be able to timely or effectively replace the service provider due to contractual restrictions, the unavailability of acceptable alternative providers, or other reasons. Further, regardless of how much we can influence our service providers, issues of concern with them could result in supervisory actions and private litigation against us and could harm our reputation, business, and financial results.Our operating systems or infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, could fail or be interrupted, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.We rely heavily upon communications, data management, and other operating systems and infrastructure to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. Any failure of or interruption in these systems or infrastructure or those of our service providers or others on whom we rely—including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, unplanned or unsuccessful updates to technology, sudden increases in transaction volume, human errors, fraud or other misconduct, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or the commencement of new businesses, energy or similar infrastructure outages, disruptions in communications networks or systems, natural disasters, catastrophic events, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political or social unrest, external or internal security 18Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kbreaches, acts of vandalism, cyberattacks such as computer viruses and malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans—could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans and operating leases, underwriting or processing loan or operating-lease applications, servicing loans and operating leases, accessing online accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, communicating with our customers, managing our investment portfolio, or otherwise conducting our business and operations. These adverse effects could be exacerbated if systems or infrastructure need to be taken offline or meaningfully repaired, if backup systems or infrastructure are not adequately redundant and effective for the conduct of our business and operations, or if technological or other solutions do not exist or are slow to be developed. Further, to the extent that the systems or infrastructure of service providers or others are involved, we may have little or no knowledge, control, or influence over how and when failures or delays are addressed. As a digital financial services company, we are susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm as a result of these risks.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure collection, storage, processing, and transmission of this information are critical to our business and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost, or stolen or if related operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other damage.Even when a failure of or interruption in operating systems or infrastructure is timely resolved, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. We also could be exposed to contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.We face a wide array of security risks that could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us.Our operating systems and infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, are subject to security risks that are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope and complexity, in part, because of the introduction of new technologies, the expanded use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hostile state-sponsored actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We, along with other financial institutions, our service providers, and others on whom we rely, have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, which could include computer viruses, malware, malicious or destructive code, phishing or spear phishing attacks, denial-of-service or denial-of-information attacks, ransomware, identity theft, access violations by employees or vendors, attacks on the personal email of employees, and ransom demands accompanied by threats to expose security vulnerabilities. We, our service providers, and others on whom we rely are also exposed to more traditional security threats to physical facilities and personnel.These security risks could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us. For example, if sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information about us or our customers or employees were improperly accessed or destroyed because of a security breach, we could experience business or operational disruptions, reputational damage, contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs. As security threats evolve, moreover, we expect to continue expending significant resources to enhance our defenses, to educate our employees, to monitor and support the defenses established by our service providers and others on whom we rely, and to investigate and remediate incidents and vulnerabilities as they arise or are identified. Even so, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because techniques change frequently, and attacks can be launched with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe. A sophisticated breach, moreover, may not be identified until well after the attack has occurred and the damage has been caused.We also could be adversely affected by security risks faced by others. For example, a cyberattack or other security breach affecting a service provider or another entity on whom we rely could negatively impact us and our ability to conduct business and operations just as much as a breach affecting us directly. Even worse, in such a circumstance, we may not receive timely notice of or information about the breach or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when the breach is addressed. In addition, a security threat affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and harm us. The mere perception of a security breach involving us or any part of the financial services industry, whether or not true, also could damage our business, operations, or reputation.Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or financial results.We significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to otherwise conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. As further described in Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, we implemented a new technology platform for our consumer automotive loans and operating leases that is utilized for customer servicing and financial reporting through the full lifecycle of these loans and leases during the first quarter of 2020. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative financial, operational, or customer impact or that, once implemented, they will perform as we or our customers expect. We also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology 19Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kdemands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted.Our enterprise risk-management framework or independent risk-management function may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.We maintain an enterprise risk-management framework that is designed to identify, measure, assess, monitor, test, control, report, escalate, and mitigate the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, operational, information-technology/security, compliance, and conduct risks. The framework incorporates risk culture and incentives, risk governance and organization, strategy and risk appetite, a material-risk taxonomy, key risk-management processes, and risk capabilities. Our chief risk officer, chief compliance officer, and other personnel who make up our independent risk-management function are responsible for overseeing and implementing the framework. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows. While we continue to evolve our risk-management framework to consider changes in business and regulatory expectations, there can be no assurance that the framework—including its design and implementation—will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the framework or its implementation, the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected. An ineffective risk-management framework or function also could give rise to enforcement and other supervisory actions, damage our reputation, and result in private litigation.We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our business lines and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity—such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer-protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws—and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages.The course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. Other contingent exposures and their ultimate resolution are similarly unpredictable for reasons that can vary based on the circumstances. As a result, we often are unable to determine how or when threatened or pending legal matters and other contingent exposures will be resolved and what losses may be incrementally and ultimately incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued or estimated for those matters and other exposures, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.Our inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or financial results.Skilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation and benefits expense is among our highest expenses, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. Recent scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel. If we were to lose and find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.Our ability to successfully make acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that governmental authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.We may from time to time seek to acquire other financial services companies or businesses. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all or that approval may not be subject to burdensome conditions. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance.Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including inaccurate financial and operational assumptions, incomplete or failed due diligence, lower-than-expected performance, higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, adverse market or other reactions, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, the potential loss of key personnel, and the possibility of litigation and other disputes. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing stockholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. 20Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThere is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.On February 18, 2020, Ally announced its execution of a definitive agreement to acquire Cardholder Management Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries, including CardWorks, Inc. and Merrick Bank Corporation (collectively, CardWorks). Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. This planned acquisition of CardWorks is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in the preceding paragraphs. In addition, if Ally’s stock price declines by more than 15%, the closing is subject to the exercise of a “fill or kill” termination right and, if the termination right is exercised, to a possible adjustment to the consideration if Ally elects to “fill” by issuing additional stock. As a result, if such a decline in our stock price occurs for any reason during the measurement period described in the definitive agreement we filed with the SEC on February 20, 2020, the planned acquisition may be terminated or may require our issuance of a larger number of shares.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Liquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, reputational damage, the confidence of depositors in us, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. Weak business or operational performance, unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries, and other failures to execute our strategic plan also could adversely affect Ally’s liquidity position.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2019, approximately $2.3 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2020, and approximately $702 million and $1.1 billion is scheduled to mature in 2021 and 2022, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2019, approximately $2.6 billion in principal amount of demand notes were outstanding, which is not included in the amount of unsecured debt described above. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2019, approximately $7.0 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2020, approximately $9.5 billion is scheduled to mature in 2021, and approximately $5.6 billion is scheduled to mature in 2022. Furthermore, at December 31, 2019, approximately $41.4 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2020, which is not included in the amounts provided above. Additional funding, whether through deposits or borrowings, will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods.We continue to rely as well on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have stabilized following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2007–2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our policies and controls are designed to enable us to maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and operating lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of customer and investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer to section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.We have a significant amount of indebtedness apart from deposit liabilities. At December 31, 2019, we had approximately $40.7 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $25.8 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 17.3% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2019. We also have the ability to create additional indebtedness.If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, more of our cash flow from operations would need to be allocated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to execute our strategic plan and withstand competitive pressures and could reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.21Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands.The cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.While some of our credit ratings were raised to investment grade during 2019, future downgrades to our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations or demands may result in higher borrowing costs, reduced access to the banking and capital markets, more restrictive terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements, and disadvantageous provisions being triggered in existing borrowing arrangements.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, and personal lending), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance, mortgage finance, and personal lending), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of the regulatory and supervisory environments in which we operate, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, changing customer preferences and consumer and business sentiment, and monetary and fiscal policies. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investment in systems or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, continuing to enhance our reputation, or prudently managing risks and expenses.Challenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our businesses are driven by wealth creation in the economy, robust market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, unfavorable changes in interest rates, declines in household incomes, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, raise our operating and other expenses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans, investment portfolio, and other assets. Further, if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.Geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. For example, acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken in response to terrorism could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.Significant repurchases or indemnification payments in our securitizations or whole-loan sales could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase and indemnification obligations in our securitizations and whole-loan sales. If we were to breach a representation, warranty, or covenant in connection with a securitization or whole-loan sale, we may be required to repurchase the affected loans or operating leases or otherwise compensate investors or purchasers for losses caused by the breach. If the scale or frequency of repurchases or indemnification payments were to increase substantially from its present levels, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In such a circumstance, we also could suffer reputational damage, become subject to stricter supervisory scrutiny and private litigation, and find our access to capital and banking markets more limited or more costly.22Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, private litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.We employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held-for-sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses, reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods of market dislocation or illiquidity. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.Market prices for securities and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, shifts in investor sentiment, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity.Changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. For example, the adoption of CECL effective January 1, 2020, has resulted in a significant increase to our allowance for loan losses. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial accounting standards issued by the FASB, but not yet adopted by the company.The financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution could adversely affect us.The financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. If any of these institutions were to become or perceived to be unstable, were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time, or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Because of interrelationships within the 23Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kfinancial system, this could occur even if the institution itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or operating lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.We are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Negative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.The performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, stricter regulatory or supervisory environments, cyber incidents and other security breaches, inabilities to meet customer expectations, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or perceived conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, inappropriate conduct by employees, and inadequate corporate governance.Our failure to maintain appropriate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices and disclosures could result in reputational harm, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.Governments, investors, customers, and the general public are increasingly focused on ESG practices and disclosures. For us and others in the financial-services industry, this focus extends to the practices and disclosures of the customers, counterparties, and service providers with whom we choose to do business. For example, while we have a relatively smaller carbon footprint as a digital financial services company and do not have commercial-lending relationships with a host of sensitive industries (such as those whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to the environment or the public health), the majority of our business and operations are connected to the automotive industry. Views about ESG are diverse, dynamic, and rapidly changing, and if we were to fail to maintain appropriate ESG practices and disclosures, we could suffer reputational damage, a loss of customer and investor confidence, and adverse business and financial results.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.Any future dividends on our common stock or changes in our stock-repurchase program will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to the FRB’s review of and non-objection to our capital plan, which is unpredictable. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. There is no assurance that our Board of Directors will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases.It is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so.The market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions:•limiting the liability of our directors and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and•limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common stock in the aggregate.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder 24Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kwho owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any BHC like Ally or any insured depository institution like Ally Bank.Any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock"
15,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2019-02-20,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We believe that the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to Regulation and SupervisionThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various governmental agencies and industry SROs that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. This regulatory and supervisory oversight is designed to protect public and private interests—such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors—that may not always be aligned with those of our stockholders or non-deposit creditors. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In the last decade, governmental scrutiny of the financial services industry has intensified, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other laws that govern financial services, and a multitude of related business practices have been altered. While the scope, intensity, and focus of governmental oversight can vary from time to time, we expect to continue devoting substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.Ally operates as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial and related activities—including securities, advisory, insurance, and merchant-banking activities—beyond the business of banking. To remain eligible to do so, Ally and Ally Bank must remain well capitalized and well managed as defined under applicable law. If Ally or Ally Bank were found not to be well capitalized or well managed, we may be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial and related activities permitted for FHCs and may be required to discontinue these activities or even divest Ally Bank. In addition, if we fail to achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the CRA, our ability to expand these financial and related activities or make acquisitions could be restricted.In connection with their continuous supervision and examinations of us, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, the NYDFS, or other regulatory agencies may require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to implement or maintain the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement and other supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. Supervisory actions could entail significant 12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Krestrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Enforcement and other supervisory actions also may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties or injunctions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of investor confidence. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time. As a result, any enforcement or other supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.Our regulatory and supervisory environments are not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, and other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively. For example, while Congress nullified the CFPB’s guidance about compliance with fair-lending laws in the context of indirect automotive financing, the NYDFS has since adopted arguably more far-reaching guidance on the subject. Changes in the regulatory and supervisory environments could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, enhancing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities, and negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Further, noncompliance with applicable laws could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of enforcement and other supervisory actions or private litigation.Our ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.A primary component of our business strategy is the continued growth of Ally Bank, which is a direct bank with no branch network. This growth includes amassing a higher level of retail deposits and expanding our consumer and commercial lending. If regulatory agencies raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it, we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities—such as unsecured funding in the capital markets—could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.We are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.We are currently subject to enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB as required or authorized under the Dodd-Frank Act, including capital planning and stress testing requirements for large and noncomplex BHCs with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in total nonbank assets. Specifically, Ally is subject to annual supervisory and semiannual company-run stress tests and must submit a proposed capital plan to the FRB annually in connection with CCAR. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The FRB will either object to our proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide a notice of non-objection. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB—whether due to how well our business and operations are forecasted to perform, how capably we execute our capital planning process, how acutely the FRB projects severely adverse conditions to be, or otherwise—may prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions, may compel us to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to stockholders, may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities, or may damage our reputation and result in a loss of investor confidence.Further, we may be required to raise capital if we are at risk of failing to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital ratios or related supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, changes in accounting standards that affect capital (such as CECL), or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Even if we are able to raise capital but do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.Existing enhanced prudential standards also require Ally to conduct liquidity stress tests and maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures. These enhanced liquidity standards, together with a quantitative minimum liquidity coverage ratio that we must satisfy as a complement to these standards, could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.In May 2018, targeted amendments to the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial-services laws were enacted through the EGRRCP Act, including amendments that affect whether and, if so, how the FRB applies enhanced prudential standards to BHCs like us with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets. During the fourth quarter of 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies issued proposals that would implement these amendments in the EGRRCP Act and establish risk-based categories for determining the prudential standards and the capital and liquidity requirements that apply to large U.S. banking organizations. Under the proposals, Ally 13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kwould be treated as a Category IV firm and, for the most part, would be subject to prudential standards that are more tailored to our risk profile. Similar proposals revising the FRB’s capital-plan rule and the FRB’s and the FDIC’s resolution-planning requirements are expected as well. Additionally, during the first quarter of 2019, the FRB announced that a number of large and noncomplex BHCs with $100 billion or more but less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets, including Ally, will not be required to submit a capital plan to the FRB, participate in the supervisory stress test or CCAR, or conduct company-run stress tests during the 2019 cycle. Instead, Ally’s capital actions during this cycle will be largely based on the results from its 2018 supervisory stress test. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The FRB and other U.S. banking agencies, however, control when and how the existing proposals and any future proposals may be considered and adopted, and their actions cannot be predicted with any certainty. Final rules may be more or less favorable than the proposals. Even if favorable to us in form and content, final rules may be interpreted, applied, and enforced by regulatory agencies in ways that dilute or eliminate that favorability. In addition, other laws may be enacted, adopted, interpreted, applied, and enforced in ways that offset any favorability generated by these proposals.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is fierce and has only intensified with the implementation of enhanced capital and liquidity requirements in the last decade. Ally Bank does not have a branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other digital channels, from customers of Ally Invest, and through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Brokered deposits totaled $16.9 billion at December 31, 2018, which represented 15.9% of Ally Bank’s total deposits. In addition, our ability to maintain or grow deposits may be constrained by our lack of in-person banking services, gaps in our product and service offerings, changes in consumer trends, competition from fintech companies and emerging financial-services providers, or any loss of confidence in our brand or our business. Our level of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth, and by changes in monetary or fiscal policies that influence deposit or other interest rates. Perceptions of our financial strength, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base.Requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results.In December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on the global Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules implementing U.S. Basel III, which substantially revised the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report.Ally and Ally Bank became subject to U.S. Basel III on January 1, 2015, although a number of its provisions—including capital buffers and certain regulatory capital deductions—were subject to a phase-in period through December 31, 2018. U.S. Basel III subjects Ally and Ally Bank to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. U.S. Basel III also has, over time, imposed more stringent deductions for specified DTAs and other assets and limited our ability to meet regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities or other hybrid securities.If Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on capital distributions as well as acquisitions and new activities, restrictions on our acceptance of brokered deposits, a loss of our status as an FHC, informal or formal enforcement and other supervisory actions, or even resolution or receivership. Any of these sanctions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Through its adoption of CECL, the FASB has introduced a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. When effective for us on   January 1, 2020, CECL is expected to substantially increase our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative day-one adjustment to equity. In December 2018, the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies approved a final rule to mitigate the impact of CECL on regulatory capital by allowing BHCs and banks, including Ally, to phase in the day-one impact of CECL over a period of three years for regulatory capital purposes. In addition, the FRB announced that although BHCs subject to company-run stress tests as part of CCAR must incorporate CECL beginning in the 2020 cycle, the FRB also further clarified that, in order to reduce uncertainty, it will maintain its current modeling framework for the allowance for loan losses in supervisory stress tests through the 2021 cycle. It is not yet clear whether, taken together, these actions by the U.S. banking agencies will mitigate the impact of CECL to a degree that is sufficient for us to sustain appropriate levels of regulatory capital without meaningfully altering our business, financial, and operational plans, including our current level of capital distributions. If the actions are insufficient, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could suffer.In April 2018, the FRB issued a proposal that would introduce a stress capital buffer based on firm-specific stress test performance—which would effectively replace the non-stress capital conservation buffer—as well as several related changes to CCAR. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In December 14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as Basel IV), many of which—if adopted in the United States—could heighten regulatory capital standards. How these proposals and revisions will be harmonized and finalized in the United States is not clear or predictable, and no assurance can be provided that they would not further impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects in an adverse way.Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.A fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries. We also could be negatively impacted by political scrutiny of the financial-services industry in general or our business or operations in particular, whether or not warranted, and by an environment where criticizing financial-services providers or their activities is politically advantageous.Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Refer to the risk factor below, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition, for more information on how the FRB could affect interest rates. These policies and related governmental actions could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations—for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect us.If our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to stockholders, or repurchase our common stock.Ally is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in significant part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to stockholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary’s performance, or investments in a subsidiary’s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally’s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally in certain situations. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally’s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).Legislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. For example, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our service providers and that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Several states also have adopted or proposed cybersecurity laws targeting these issues.Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy may compel us to enhance or modify our systems, invest in new systems, change our service providers, or alter our business practices or our policies on data governance and privacy. If any of these outcomes were to occur, our operational costs could increase significantly. In addition, if government authorities were to conclude that we or our service providers had not adequately implemented laws on cybersecurity and data privacy or had not otherwise met related supervisory expectations, we could be subject to enforcement and other supervisory actions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, reputational damage, or a loss of investor confidence.Risks Related to Our BusinessWeak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or growth in our nonprime or used vehicle financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is centered around lending and banking, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, operating leases, and securities. As a result, in the ordinary course of business, credit risk is our most pronounced risk.Our business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including 15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kin the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could result as well from us failing to appropriately underwrite loans and operating leases that we originate or purchase or from us adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans and operating leases increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that adversely affect earnings if debt securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our monitoring of our credit risk and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.We continue to have exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing and used vehicle financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.3 billion, or approximately 11.7% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2018, as compared to $8.8 billion, or approximately 12.9% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2018, and 2017, $203 million and $204 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the carrying value of our consumer automotive used vehicle loans before allowance for loan losses was $36.3 billion, or approximately 51.5% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2018, as compared to $31.8 billion, or approximately 46.8% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2017. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive loans or used vehicle financing were to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree.As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by applicants and other third parties, such as automotive dealers and credit reporting agencies. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses and which represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Any increase in the allowance results in an associated decrease in net income and capital and, if significant, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing quantitative and qualitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our loan portfolio, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. For example, our shift to a full credit spectrum consumer automotive finance portfolio over the past several years could result in additional increases in our allowance for loan losses in the future.Through its adoption of CECL, the FASB has introduced a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, which includes the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Immediately when effective on January 1, 2020, CECL is expected to substantially increase our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative adjustment to equity. While the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies have taken steps to mitigate the impact of CECL on regulatory capital, it is not yet clear whether these actions will do so to a degree that is sufficient for us to sustain appropriate levels of regulatory capital without meaningfully altering our business, financial, and operational plans, including our current level of capital distributions. Refer to the risk factor above, titled Requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results, for more information about the consequences of our failure to satisfy regulatory capital requirements.Regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer’s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, shifting financial and other pressures exerted by manufacturers on dealers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. Any one or more of these trends could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.Our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future as a result of intense competition and other factors. The number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 7% as compared to December 31, 2017. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason—including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products and services that meet the needs of the dealers, compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors, or effectively counter the exclusivity privileges that some competitors have with automotive manufacturers—our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.General Motors Company (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (Chrysler) dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.While we have diversified—and are continuing to diversify—our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2018, 48% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 27% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 36% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 27% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Chrysler dealers and customers. GM, Chrysler, and their captive automotive finance companies compete vigorously with us and could take further actions that negatively impact the amount of business that we do with GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers. Further, a significant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s business—including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles, GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers, or the rate or volume of recalls of GM or Chrysler vehicles—could negatively impact our GM and Chrysler dealer and retail customer bases and the value of collateral securing our extensions of credit to them. Any future reductions in GM and Chrysler business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by the sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted, in turn, by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income, interest rates, credit availability, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Vehicle loans and operating leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2018, more than 65% of our average earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or operating leases and related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, relative market prices for new and used vehicles, perceived vehicle quality, overall vehicle prices, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income, interest rates, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, when the recent economic crisis began in 2007–2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive operating lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the operating lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle—as reflected in the sale proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination—is less than the expected 17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kresidual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the operating lease transaction than our priced expectation. Our expectation of used vehicle values is also a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and operating lease originations. In stressed economic environments, residual-value risk may be even more volatile than credit risk. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and operating leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic and market conditions, the political and regulatory environments, business and consumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and expectations about the future (including future changes in interest rates). We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, or events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, increasing the volatility of market rates of interest, or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices.The levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including the following:•increase the cost or decrease the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments;•reduce the return on or demand for loans or increase the prepayment speed of loans;•increase customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults;•negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles; and•reduce the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies.The level of and changes in market rates of interest—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while an accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. A rising interest rate environment can pose different challenges, such as potentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed-income securities. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the FRB has recently increased this benchmark rate. In addition, the FRB has begun to end its quantitative-easing program and reduce the size of its balance sheet, which is expected to exert upward pressure on interest rates as well and which also may create market volatility in interest rates. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Uncertainty about the future of the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business and financial results.LIBOR meaningfully influences market interest rates around the globe. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR as currently constructed is not guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and whether other rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. In 2014, the FRB and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) to identify best practices for alternative reference rates, identify best practices for contract robustness, develop an adoption plan, and create an implementation plan with metrics of success and a timeline. The ARRC accomplished its first set of objectives and has identified the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as the rate that represents best practice for use in certain new U.S. dollar derivatives and other financial contracts. The ARRC also published its Paced Transition Plan, with specific steps and timelines designed to encourage adoption of the SOFR. The ARRC was reconstituted in 2018 to help to ensure the successful implementation of the Paced Transition Plan and serve as a forum to coordinate and track planning across cash and derivatives products and market participants currently using LIBOR.No assurance can be provided that the uncertainties around LIBOR or their resolution will not adversely affect the use, level, and volatility of LIBOR or other interest rates or the value of LIBOR-based securities—including Ally’s 8.125% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Trust Preferred Securities, Series 2—or other securities or financial arrangements. Further, the viability of SOFR as an alternative reference rate and the availability and acceptance of other alternative reference rates are unclear and also may have adverse effects on market rates of interest and the value of securities and other financial arrangements. These uncertainties, proposals and actions to resolve them, and their ultimate resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results.18Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe rely extensively on third-party service providers in delivering products and services to our customers and otherwise conducting our business and operations, and their failure to perform to our standards or other issues of concern with them could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial results.We seek to distinguish ourselves as a customer-centric company that delivers passionate customer service and innovative financial solutions and that is relentlessly focused on “Doing It Right.” Third-party service providers, however, are key to much of our business and operations, including online and mobile banking, mortgage finance, brokerage, customer service, and operating systems and infrastructure. While we have implemented a supplier-risk-management program and can exert varying degrees of influence over our service providers, we do not control them, their actions, or their businesses. Our contracts with service providers, moreover, may not require or sufficiently incent them to perform at levels and in ways that we would choose acting on our own. No assurance can be provided that service providers will perform to our standards, adequately represent our brand, comply with applicable law, appropriately manage their own risks, remain financially or operationally viable, abide by their contractual obligations, or continue to provide us with the services that we require. In such a circumstance, our ability to deliver products and services to customers, to satisfy customer expectations, and to otherwise successfully conduct our business and operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we may need to incur substantial expenses to address issues of concern with a service provider, and even if the issues cannot be acceptably resolved, we may not be able to timely or effectively replace the service provider due to contractual restrictions, the unavailability of acceptable alternative providers, or other reasons. Further, regardless of how much we can influence our service providers, issues of concern with them could result in supervisory actions and private litigation against us and could harm our reputation, business, and financial results.Our operating systems or infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, could fail or be interrupted, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.We rely heavily upon communications, data management, and other operating systems and infrastructure to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. Any failure of or interruption in these systems or infrastructure or those of our service providers or others on whom we rely—including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, unplanned or unsuccessful updates to technology, sudden increases in transaction volume, human errors, fraud or other misconduct, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or the commencement of new businesses, energy or similar infrastructure outages, disruptions in communications networks or systems, natural disasters, catastrophic events, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political or social unrest, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, cyberattacks such as computer viruses and malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans—could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans and operating leases, underwriting or processing loan or operating-lease applications, servicing loans and operating leases, accessing online accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, communicating with our customers, managing our investment portfolio, or otherwise conducting our business and operations. These adverse effects could be exacerbated if systems or infrastructure need to be taken offline or meaningfully repaired, if backup systems or infrastructure are not adequately redundant and effective for the conduct of our business and operations, or if technological or other solutions do not exist or are slow to be developed. Further, to the extent that the systems or infrastructure of service providers or others are involved, we may have little or no control or influence over how and when failures or delays are addressed. As a digital financial services company, we are susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm as a result of these risks.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure collection, storage, processing, and transmission of this information are critical to our business and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost, or stolen or if related operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other damage. Even when a failure of or interruption in operating systems or infrastructure is timely resolved, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. We also could be exposed to contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.We face a wide array of security risks that could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us.Our operating systems and infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, are subject to security risks that are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope and complexity, in part, because of the introduction of new technologies, the expanded use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hostile state-sponsored actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We along with other financial institutions, our service providers, and others on whom we rely have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyberattacks, which could include computer viruses, malware, malicious or destructive code, phishing or spear phishing attacks, denial-of-service or denial-of-information attacks, ransomware, identity theft, access violations by employees or vendors, attacks on the personal email of employees, and ransom demands accompanied by threats to expose security vulnerabilities. We, our service providers, and others on whom we rely are also exposed to more traditional security threats to physical facilities and personnel.These security risks could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us. For example, if sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information about us or our customers or employees were improperly accessed or destroyed because of a security breach, we could experience business or operational disruptions, reputational damage, contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs. As security threats evolve, moreover, we expect to continue expending significant resources to enhance our 19Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kdefenses, to educate our employees, to monitor and support the defenses established by our service providers and others on whom we rely, and to investigate and remediate incidents and vulnerabilities as they arise or are identified. Even so, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because techniques change frequently, and attacks can be launched with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe. A sophisticated breach, moreover, may not be identified until well after the attack has occurred and the damage has been caused.We also could be adversely affected by security risks faced by others. For example, a cyberattack or other security breach affecting a service provider or another entity on whom we rely could negatively impact us and our ability to conduct business and operations just as much as a breach affecting us directly. Even worse, in such a circumstance, we may not receive timely notice of or information about the breach or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when the breach is addressed. In addition, a security threat affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and harm us. The mere perception of a security breach involving us or any part of the financial services industry, whether or not true, also could damage our business, operations, or reputation.Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or financial results.We significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to otherwise conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative operational or customer impact or that, once implemented, they will perform as we or our customers expect. We also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business, financial results, or reputation could be negatively impacted.Our enterprise risk-management framework or independent risk-management function may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.We maintain an enterprise risk-management framework that is designed to identify, measure, assess, monitor, test, control, report, escalate, and mitigate the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, operational, information-technology/security, compliance, and conduct risks. The framework incorporates risk culture and incentives, risk governance and organization, strategy and risk appetite, a material-risk taxonomy, key risk-management processes, and risk capabilities. Our chief risk officer, chief compliance officer, and other personnel who make up our independent risk-management function are responsible for overseeing and implementing the framework. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows. There can be no assurance, however, that the framework—including its design and implementation—will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in the framework or its implementation, the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected. An ineffective risk-management framework or function also could give rise to enforcement and other supervisory actions, damage our reputation, and result in private litigation.We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.We are involved from time to time in a variety of judicial, alternative-dispute, and other proceedings arising out of our business and operations. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our business lines and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity—such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws—and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages.The course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. As a result, we often are unable to determine how or when threatened or pending legal matters will be resolved and what losses may be incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued or estimated for those matters, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.20Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or financial results.Skilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation and benefits expense is among our highest expenses, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. Recent scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel. If we were to lose and find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.Our ability to successfully make acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that government authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.We may from time to time seek to acquire other financial services companies or businesses. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance.Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including lower-than-expected performance or higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, and the potential loss of key employees. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing stockholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Liquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, reputational damage, the confidence of depositors in us, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. Weak business or operational performance, unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries, and other failures to execute our strategic plan also could adversely affect Ally’s liquidity position.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2018, approximately $1.7 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2019, and approximately $2.3 billion and $702 million is scheduled to mature in 2020 and 2021, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2018, approximately $2.5 billion in principal amount of demand notes were outstanding, which is not included in the amount of unsecured debt described above. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2018, approximately $7.3 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2019, approximately $7.4 billion is scheduled to mature in 2020, and approximately $10.2 billion is scheduled to mature in 2021. Furthermore, at December 31, 2018, approximately $31.5 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2019, which is not included in the amounts provided above. Additional funding, whether through deposits or borrowings, will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods.We continue to rely as well on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have stabilized following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2007–2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our policies and controls are designed to enable us to maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and operating lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention and private litigation, harm our reputation, and cause a loss of investor confidence, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer 21Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kto section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.We have a significant amount of indebtedness apart from deposit liabilities. At December 31, 2018, we had approximately $55.3 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $39.7 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 21.0% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2018. We also have the ability to create additional indebtedness.If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, more of our cash flow from operations would need to be allocated to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to execute our strategic plan and withstand competitive pressures and could reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance and mortgage finance), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance and mortgage finance), brokerage, and investment-advisory services are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of the regulatory and supervisory environments in which we operate, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, changing customer preferences and consumer and business sentiment, and monetary and fiscal policies. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investment in systems or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, continuing to enhance our reputation, or prudently managing risks and expenses.Our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands.The cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Some of our current credit ratings are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the banking and capital markets. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded further or were to otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands, our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could become even more challenging and, as a result, negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations or demands could result in more restrictive terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as trigger disadvantageous provisions of existing borrowing arrangements.Challenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our businesses are driven by wealth creation in the economy, robust market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, unfavorable changes in interest rates, declines in household incomes, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, raise our operating and other expenses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans, investment portfolio, and other assets. Further, if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.22Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KActs or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.Geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. For example, acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken in response to terrorism could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.Significant repurchases or indemnification payments in our securitizations or whole-loan sales could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase and indemnification obligations in our securitizations and whole-loan sales. If we were to breach a representation, warranty, or covenant in connection with a securitization or whole-loan sale, we may be required to repurchase the affected loans or operating leases or otherwise compensate investors or purchasers for losses caused by the breach. If the scale or frequency of repurchases or indemnification payments were to increase substantially from its present levels, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In such a circumstance, we also could suffer reputational damage, become subject to stricter supervisory scrutiny and private litigation, and find our access to capital and banking markets more limited or more costly.Our business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, private litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.We employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects could be adversely affected.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held-for-sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of our operating lease assets. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on automotive dealers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods of market dislocation or illiquidity. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.Market prices for securities and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, shifts in investor sentiment, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity.23Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KChanges in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for financial accounting standards issued by the FASB, but not yet adopted by the company, with effective dates between January 1, 2019, and January 1, 2020.The financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution could adversely affect us.The financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. If any of these institutions were to become or perceived to be unstable, were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time, or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Because of interrelationships within the financial system, this could occur even if the institution itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or operating lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.We are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Negative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.The performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, stricter regulatory or supervisory environments, cyber incidents and other security breaches, inabilities to meet customer expectations, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or perceived conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, inappropriate conduct by employees, and inadequate corporate governance.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.Any future dividends on our common stock or changes in our stock-repurchase program will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to the FRB’s review of and non-objection to our capital plan, which is unpredictable. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. There is no assurance that our Board of Directors will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases.It is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so.The market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions:•limiting the liability of our directors and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and24Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K•limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common stock in the aggregate.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any BHC like Ally or any insured depository institution like Ally Bank.Any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock"
8,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2018-02-21,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We believe that the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with the MD&A in Part II, Item 7 of this report, and the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes thereto. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.11Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KRisks Related to Regulation and SupervisionThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various government agencies and industry self-regulatory organizations that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. These regulatory and supervisory frameworks are designed to protect public or private interests—such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors—that may not always be aligned with those of our stockholders or non-deposit creditors. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In the last decade, government scrutiny of the financial services industry has intensified, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other laws that govern financial services, and a multitude of related business practices have been altered. While the scope, intensity, and focus of government oversight can vary from time to time, we expect to continue devoting substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.Ally operates as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial and related activities—including securities, advisory, insurance, and merchant-banking activities—beyond the business of banking. To remain eligible to do so, Ally and Ally Bank must remain well capitalized and well managed as defined under applicable law. If Ally or Ally Bank were found not to be well capitalized or well managed, we may be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial and related activities permitted for FHCs and may be required to discontinue these activities or even divest Ally Bank. In addition, if we fail to achieve a satisfactory or better rating under the CRA, our ability to expand these financial and related activities or make acquisitions could be restricted.In connection with their continuous supervision and examinations of us, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, the NYDFS, or other regulatory agencies may require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to implement or maintain the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. Supervisory actions could entail significant restrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Supervisory actions also may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties, the enforcement of supervisory requirements through injunctions or other administrative or judicial orders, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of investor confidence. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time. As a result, any supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.Our regulatory environment is not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, or other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively. Changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, enhancing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities, and negatively impacting our financial condition and results of operations. Further, noncompliance with applicable laws could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of supervisory actions or private litigation.Our ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.A primary component of our business strategy is the continued growth of Ally Bank. This growth includes amassing a higher level of retail deposits, expanding our commercial lending, and originating increased volumes of consumer products such as residential mortgage loans. If our regulatory agencies raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it—including any associated affiliate transactions that are governed and constrained by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act—we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities—such as unsecured funding in the capital markets—could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.We are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.We are subject to the enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, including capital planning requirements for large and noncomplex BHCs with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion and total nonbank assets of less than $75 billion. As part of these enhanced prudential standards, Ally is subject to supervisory and company-run stress tests and must submit a proposed capital plan to the FRB annually in connection with its CCAR process. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The proposed capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally’s capital. The proposed capital plan must also include a discussion of how Ally, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and serve as a source 12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kof strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to the proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide notice of non-objection to Ally. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB—whether due to how well our businesses and operations are forecasted to perform, how capably we execute our capital planning process, how acutely the FRB projects severely adverse conditions to be, or otherwise—may prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions, may compel us to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to stockholders, may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities, and may damage our reputation and result in a loss of investor confidence.We may be required to raise capital as well if we are at risk of failing to satisfy our minimum regulatory capital ratios or other related supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions, and harm our reputation, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Further, if we are able to raise capital and do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing stockholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.The enhanced prudential standards also require Ally to conduct liquidity stress tests and maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures. These enhanced liquidity standards, together with a quantitative minimum liquidity coverage ratio that we must satisfy as a complement to these standards, could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.Additionally, the FRB has proposed rules to implement other enhanced prudential standards mandated by Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act and related capital and liquidity requirements, including single-counterparty credit limits, an early remediation framework, and a quantitative minimum net stable funding ratio. Once adopted and implemented, these rules also could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is fierce and has only intensified with the implementation of enhanced capital and liquidity requirements in the last decade. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other direct banking, from customers of Ally Invest, and through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Brokered deposits totaled $15.2 billion at December 31, 2017, which represented 16% of Ally Bank’s total deposits. In addition, our ability to maintain or grow direct banking deposits may be constrained by our lack of in-person banking services, changes in consumer trends, or any loss of confidence in our brand. Our level of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth, and by changes in monetary or fiscal policies that influence deposit or other interest rates. Perceptions of our financial strength, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base.The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial-reform laws and policies on us remains unclear and unpredictable but could have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, and other financial-reform laws and policies have substantially changed the legal and supervisory frameworks under which we operate and have adversely affected our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. While much in the Dodd-Frank Act has been implemented, some meaningful provisions remain subject to further rulemaking, transition periods, and the discretion of various regulatory agencies. Even provisions that have been implemented are or may become the subject of interpretive disputes, litigation, proposed legislative or regulatory amendments, or shifting supervisory priorities. For example, the CFPB—which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act—has aggressively enforced its positions on a wide range of consumer protection laws that affect our business, including in the context of indirect automotive lending. Some of these positions or their application in particular cases, however, have been contested by affected companies, as has the constitutionality of the structure of the CFPB itself. The outcomes of these matters and their impact on both the meaning of consumer protection laws and the enforcement powers and posture of the CFPB remain unclear and unpredictable but could adversely affect us. Recent changes in leadership within the CFPB have added to this lack of clarity and predictability. Similarly, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and financial-reform laws and policies as whole on us cannot be predicted with any certainty and may not be known for a number of years, but individually or collectively, they may have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. In addition, these laws and policies may impact us differently than other financial institutions due to a number of factors, such as differences in activities, size, risk profile, complexity, or regulatory or supervisory status.13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KRequirements under the U.S. Basel III rules to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results.In December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on the global Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States as well as related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The U.S. Basel III rules represent substantial revisions to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations.Ally and Ally Bank became subject to the U.S. Basel III rules on January 1, 2015, although a number of them—including new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions—are subject to phase-in through December 31, 2018. The U.S. Basel III rules subject Ally and Ally Bank to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The U.S. Basel III rules also will, over time, impose more stringent deductions for specified DTAs and other assets and limit our ability to meet regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities or other hybrid securities.If Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on acquisitions or new activities, a loss of our status as an FHC, informal or formal supervisory actions, or even resolution or receivership. Any of these sanctions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.In December 2017, the Basel Committee approved revisions to the global Basel III capital framework (commonly known as Basel IV), many of which—if adopted in the United States—could heighten regulatory capital standards even more. At the same time, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed to simplify several elements of the U.S. Basel III rules. How these revisions and proposals will be harmonized and finalized in the United States is not clear or predictable, and no assurance can be provided that they would not further impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects in an adverse way.Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.A fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries.Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. Refer to the risk factor below, titled The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition, for more information on how the FRB could affect interest rates. These actions and policies, therefore, could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations—for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic and market conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Act) is expected to significantly affect these incentives and disincentives, including by revising corporate and individual tax rates, altering the deductibility of net interest expense and capital outlays, and limiting the deductibility of state and local taxes as well as interest on residential mortgage loans. The direct and indirect effects of the Tax Act on us and our customers have not yet been holistically assessed, but changes in borrowing patterns, asset valuations, and other economic and market conditions could result and adversely impact our business and financial results. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies, as well as their consequences for the economy and the markets in which we operate, are beyond our control and difficult to predict but could adversely affect us.If our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to stockholders, or repurchase our common stock.Ally is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in significant part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to stockholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary’s performance, or investments in a subsidiary’s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally’s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally in certain situations. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally’s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KLegislative or regulatory initiatives on cybersecurity and data privacy could adversely impact our business and financial results.Cybersecurity and data privacy risks have received heightened legislative and regulatory attention. For example, the U.S. banking agencies have proposed enhanced cyber risk management standards that would apply to us and our service providers and that would address cyber risk governance and management, management of internal and external dependencies, and incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. Several states also have adopted or proposed cybersecurity laws targeting these issues.Legislation and regulations on cybersecurity and data privacy may compel us to enhance or modify our systems, invest in new systems, change our service providers, or alter our business practices or our policies on data governance and privacy. If any of these outcomes were to occur, our operational costs could increase significantly. In addition, if government authorities were to conclude that we or our service providers had not adequately implemented laws on cybersecurity and data privacy or had not otherwise met related supervisory expectations, we could be subject to supervisory actions, related litigation by private plaintiffs, reputational damage, or a loss of investor confidence.Risks Related to Our BusinessWeak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or growth in our nonprime or used vehicle financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is centered around lending and banking, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, leases, and securities. As a result, credit risk is our most pronounced risk.Our business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including in the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could result as well from us failing to appropriately underwrite loans that we originate or purchase or from us adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that adversely affect earnings if investment securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our monitoring of our credit risk and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.We continue to have exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing and used vehicle financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $8.8 billion, or approximately 12.9% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2017, as compared to $9.1 billion, or approximately 13.8% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2016. At December 31, 2017, and 2016, $204 million and $211 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, the carrying value of our consumer automotive used vehicle loans before allowance for loan losses was $31.8 billion, or approximately 46.8% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2017, as compared to $28.5 billion, or approximately 43.4% of our total consumer automotive loans at December 31, 2016. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive loans or used vehicle financing were to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree.As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk from having engaged in the transaction.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses and which represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Any increase in the allowance results in an associated decrease in net income and capital and, if significant, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThe determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing quantitative and qualitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our loan portfolio, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. For example, our shift to a full credit spectrum retail automotive finance portfolio mix has increased our allowance for loan losses and could result in additional increases in our allowance for loan losses in the future.The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses (CECL), which introduces a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost, such as the vast majority of our finance receivables and loan portfolio. Under CECL, credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost should be determined based on the total current expected credit losses over the life of the financial asset or group of financial assets. In effect, this means that the financial asset or group of financial assets should be presented at the net amount expected to be collected. CECL will become effective on January 1, 2020, and represents a significant departure from existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which currently provide for credit losses on financial assets measured at amortized cost to be measured as they are incurred. When effective, CECL is likely to materially increase our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative adjustment to equity. This increase to the allowance for loan losses could also adversely impact our regulatory capital position if the FRB and other U.S. banking agencies do not amend existing regulatory capital rules to relieve us from the capital impact associated with the negative adjustment to equity. Refer to the risk factor above, titled Requirements under the U.S. Basel III rules to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results, for more information about the consequences of our failure to satisfy regulatory capital requirements.Regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.We have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer’s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. Any one or more of these trends could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.While the number of dealers with whom we have retail relationships increased during 2017, the number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 5% as compared to December 31, 2016. Further, our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future as a result of intense competition and other factors. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason—including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors, or effectively counter the exclusivity privileges that some competitors have with automotive manufacturers—our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this were to occur, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.General Motors Company (GM) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC (Chrysler) dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.While we have diversified—and are continuing to diversify—our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2017, 56% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 32% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 28% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 28% of our consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Chrysler dealers and customers. GM, Chrysler, and their captive automotive finance companies compete forcefully with us and could take further actions that negatively impact the amount of business that we do with GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers. Further, a significant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s business—including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles, GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers, or 16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kthe rate or volume of recalls of GM or Chrysler vehicles—could negatively impact our GM and Chrysler dealer and retail customer bases. Any future reductions in GM and Chrysler business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by the sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted, in turn, by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income, interest rates, credit availability, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2007–2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.Vehicle loans and leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2017, more than 69% of our average earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or leases or related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, relative market prices for new and used vehicles, perceived vehicle quality, overall vehicle prices, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income, interest rates, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, when the recent economic crisis began in 2007–2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle—as reflected in the sale proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination—is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the lease transaction than our priced expectation. Our expectation of used vehicle values is also a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and lease originations. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic and market conditions, the political and regulatory environments, business and consumer sentiment, competitive pressures, and expectations about the future (including future changes in interest rates). We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, or events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices.The levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including the following:•increase the cost or decrease the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments;•reduce the return on or demand for loans or increase the prepayment speed of loans;•increase customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults;•negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles; and•reduce the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies.The level of and changes in market rates of interest—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while an accommodative monetary policy may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. A rising interest rate environment can pose different challenges, such as potentially slowing the demand for credit, increasing delinquencies and defaults, and reducing the values of our loans and fixed-income securities. Following a prolonged period in which the federal funds rate was stable or decreasing, the FRB has begun to increase this benchmark rate. In addition, the FRB has begun to end its quantitative-easing program and reduce the size of its balance sheet, which is also 17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kexpected to exert upward pressure on interest rates. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Uncertainty about the future of the London Interbank Offer Rate (LIBOR) may adversely affect our business and financial results.LIBOR meaningfully influences market interest rates around the globe. In July 2017, the Chief Executive of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced its intent to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the administrator of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR as currently constructed is not guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR, whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted in the United Kingdom or elsewhere, and whether other rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR. No assurance can be provided that these uncertainties or their resolution will not adversely affect the use, level, and volatility of LIBOR or other interest rates or the value of LIBOR-based securities—including Ally’s 8.125% Fixed Rate/Floating Rate Trust Preferred Securities, Series 2—or other securities or financial arrangements. These uncertainties or their resolution also could negatively impact our funding costs, loan and other asset values, asset-liability management strategies, and other aspects of our business and financial results.We rely extensively on third-party service providers in delivering products and services to our customers and otherwise conducting our business and operations, and their failure to perform to our standards or other issues of concern with them could adversely affect our reputation, business, and financial results.Third-party service providers are key to much of our business and operations, including online and mobile banking, mortgage finance, brokerage, customer service, and operating systems and infrastructure. While we have implemented a supplier-risk-management program and can exert varying degrees of influence over our service providers, we do not control them, their actions, or their businesses. No assurance can be provided, therefore, that service providers will perform to our standards, adequately represent our brand, comply with applicable law, appropriately manage their own risks, remain financially or operationally viable, or continue to provide us with the services that we require. In such a circumstance, our ability to deliver products and services to customers, to satisfy customer expectations, and to otherwise successfully conduct our business and operations could be adversely affected. In addition, we may need to incur substantial expenses to address issues of concern with a service provider, and even if the issues cannot be acceptably resolved, we may not be able to timely or effectively replace the service provider due to contractual restrictions, the unavailability of acceptable alternative providers, or other reasons. Further, regardless of how much we can influence our service providers, issues of concern with them could result in supervisory actions against us and could harm our reputation, business, and financial results.Our operating systems or infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, could fail or be interrupted, which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.We rely heavily upon communications, data management, and other operating systems and infrastructure to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. Any failure of or interruption in these systems or infrastructure or those of our service providers or others on whom we rely—including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, unplanned or unsuccessful updates to technology, sudden increases in transaction volume, human errors, fraud or other misconduct, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or the commencement of new businesses, energy or similar infrastructure outages, disruptions in communications networks or systems, natural disasters, catastrophic events, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political or social unrest, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, cyberattacks such as computer viruses and malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans—could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans, underwriting or processing loans, servicing loans, accessing online accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, communicating with our customers, managing our investment portfolio, or otherwise conducting our business and operations. These adverse effects could be exacerbated if systems or infrastructure need to be taken offline or meaningfully repaired, if backup systems or infrastructure are not adequately redundant and effective for the conduct of our business and operations, or if technological or other solutions do not exist or are slow to be developed. Further, to the extent that the systems or infrastructure of service providers or others are involved, we may have little or no control or influence over how and when failures or delays are addressed. As a digital financial services company, we are susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm as a result of these risks.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data and other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure collection, storage, processing, and transmission of this information are critical to our business and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost, or stolen or if related operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other damage. Even when a failure of or interruption in operating systems or infrastructure is timely resolved, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. We also could be exposed to contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.We face a wide array of security risks that could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us.Our operating systems and infrastructure, as well as those of our service providers or others on whom we rely, are subject to security risks that are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope and complexity, in part, because of the introduction of new technologies, the expanded 18Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kuse of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of hostile state-sponsored actors, organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We along with other financial institutions, our service providers, and others on whom we rely are especially likely to be the target of cyberattacks, including computer viruses, malware, malicious or destructive code, phishing or spearphishing attacks, denial-of-service or denial-of-information attacks, ransomware, identity theft, access violations by employees or vendors, attacks on the personal email of employees, and ransom demands accompanied by threats to expose security vulnerabilities. We, our service providers, and others on whom we rely are also exposed to more traditional security threats to physical facilities and personnel.These security risks could result in business, reputational, financial, regulatory, and other harm to us. For example, if sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information about us or our customers or employees were improperly accessed or destroyed because of a security breach, we could experience business or operational disruptions, reputational damage, contractual claims, supervisory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs. As security threats evolve, moreover, we expect to continue expending significant resources to enhance our defenses, to educate our employees, to monitor and support the defenses established by our service providers and others on whom we rely, and to investigate and remediate incidents and vulnerabilities as they arise or are identified. Even so, we may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because techniques change frequently and attacks can originate with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe. A sophisticated breach, moreover, may not be identified until well after the attack has occurred and the damage has been caused.We also could be adversely affected by security risks faced by others. For example, a cyberattack or other security breach affecting a service provider or another entity on whom we rely could negatively impact us and our ability to conduct business and operations just as much as a breach affecting us directly. Even worse, in such a circumstance, we may not receive timely notice of or information about the breach or be able to exert any meaningful control or influence over how and when the breach is addressed. In addition, a security threat affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and harm us. The mere perception of a security breach involving any part of the financial services industry, whether or not true, also could damage our business and operations.Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or financial results.We significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and services and to otherwise conduct our business and operations. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial financial, human, and other resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative operational or customer impact or that, once implemented, they will perform as we or our customers expect. We also may not succeed in anticipating or keeping pace with future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted.Our enterprise, compliance, and other risk management programs or functions may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss.We maintain an independent enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, measure, assess, monitor, report, and mitigate the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, vehicle-residual, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, and operational risks. We also maintain a compliance risk management program to identify, measure, assess, monitor, and report on our adherence to applicable law, policies, and procedures. There can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for enterprise, compliance, and other risk management and related controls—including the scope and amount of our insurance and reinsurance coverage—will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business and operations. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our enterprise, compliance, or other risk management programs or if our controls break down, the performance and value of our business and operations could be adversely affected. We could be negatively impacted as well if, despite adequate programs being in place, our risk management or compliance personnel are ineffective in executing them and mitigating risk and loss. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.We are involved from time to time in a variety of judicial, alternative-dispute, and other proceedings arising out of our business and operations. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, certified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our lines of business and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity—such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws—and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages.19Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThe course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. As a result, we often are unable to determine how or when threatened or pending legal matters will be resolved and what losses may be incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued or estimated for those matters, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.Our inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or financial results.Skilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation and benefits expense is among our highest expenses, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. Recent scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel. If we were to lose and find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.Our ability to successfully make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that government authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.We may from time to time seek to make opportunistic acquisitions of other financial services companies or businesses. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance.Acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including lower-than-expected performance or higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, and the potential loss of key employees. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing stockholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying appropriate acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Liquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, reputational damage, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. Unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries also could adversely affect Ally’s liquidity position.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2017, approximately $3.6 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2018, and approximately $1.7 billion and $2.3 billion is scheduled to mature in 2019 and 2020, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2017, approximately $3.2 billion in principal amount of demand notes were outstanding, which is not included in the amount of unsecured debt described above. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2017, approximately $7.5 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2018, approximately $8.4 billion is scheduled to mature in 2019, and approximately $6.9 billion is scheduled to mature in 2020. Furthermore, at December 31, 2017, approximately $28.8 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2018, which is not included in the amounts provided above. Additional funding, whether through deposits or borrowings, will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods.We continue to rely as well on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank 20Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kalso continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have continued to stabilize following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2007–2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our policies and controls are designed to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention, and harm our reputation, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer to section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.We have a significant amount of indebtedness apart from deposit liabilities. At December 31, 2017, we had approximately $56.8 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $36.9 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 21% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also have the ability to create additional indebtedness.If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance and mortgage finance), and brokerage are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, banking (including corporate finance and mortgage finance), and brokerage are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of the regulatory and supervisory environments in which we operate, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, changing customer preferences and consumer and business sentiment, and government monetary and fiscal policies. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investments in systems or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in introducing new products and services, achieving market acceptance of our products and services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, or prudently managing expenses.Our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands.The cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Some of our current credit ratings are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the banking and capital markets. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded further or were to otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands, our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could become even more challenging and, as a result, negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations or demands could result in more restrictive terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as trigger disadvantageous provisions of existing borrowing arrangements.Challenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our businesses are driven by wealth creation in the economy, robust market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, unfavorable changes in interest rates, declines in household incomes, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, raise our operating and other expenses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our loans, investment portfolio, and other assets. Further, if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases or prices, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth 21Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kand uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.Geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. For example, acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken in response to terrorism could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.Significant repurchases or indemnification payments in our securitizations or whole-loan sales could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase and indemnification obligations in our securitizations and whole-loan sales. If we were to breach a representation, warranty, or covenant in connection with a securitization or whole-loan sale, we may be required to repurchase the affected loans or leases or otherwise compensate investors or purchasers for losses caused by the breach. If the scale or frequency of repurchases or indemnification payments were to increase substantially from its present levels, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. In such a circumstance, we also could suffer reputational damage, become subject to stricter supervisory scrutiny, and find our access to capital and banking markets more limited or more costly.Our business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.We employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the value or amount of many of our assets and liabilities. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be adversely affected.We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held-for-sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on our dealers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods of market dislocation or illiquidity. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.Market prices for securities and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, shifts in investor sentiment, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that 22Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kwe realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity.Changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for several financial accounting standards recently issued by the FASB with effective dates between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2020.The financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution could adversely affect us.The financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, and other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. If any of these institutions were to become unstable, were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time, or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. Because of interrelationships within the financial system, this could occur even if the institution itself were not systemically important or perceived to play a meaningful role in the stable functioning of the financial markets.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.We are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Negative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.The performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, stricter regulatory or supervisory environments, cyber incidents and other security breaches, inabilities to meet customer expectations, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or perceived conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, inappropriate conduct by employees, and inadequate corporate governance.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.Any future dividends on our common stock or share repurchases will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to the FRB’s review of and non-objection to our capital plan, which is unpredictable. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. There is no assurance that our Board of Directors will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases.It is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so.23Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThe market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions:•limiting the liability of our directors and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and•limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common stock in the aggregate.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any BHC like Ally or any insured depository institution like Ally Bank.Any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock"
17,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2017-02-27,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
We face many risks and uncertainties, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition (including capital and liquidity), or prospects or the value of or return on an investment in Ally. We believe that the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are described in this section, although we may be adversely affected by other risks or uncertainties that are not presently known to us, that we have failed to appreciate, or that we currently consider immaterial. These risk factors should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This Annual Report on Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.10Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KRisks Related to RegulationThe regulatory and supervisory environment in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.We are subject to extensive regulatory frameworks and to direct supervision and periodic examinations by various government agencies that are charged with overseeing the kinds of business activities in which we engage. These regulatory and supervisory frameworks are designed to protect public or private interests—such as macroeconomic policy objectives, financial-market stability and liquidity, and the confidence and security of depositors—that may not always be aligned with those of our shareholders or non-deposit creditors. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. In the last decade, moreover, government scrutiny of the financial services industry has intensified, fundamental changes have been made to the banking, securities, and other laws that govern financial services, and a multitude of related business practices have been altered. As a result, we expect to continue devoting substantial time and resources to risk management, compliance, regulatory-change management, and cybersecurity and other technology initiatives, each of which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably or to pursue advantageous business opportunities.Ally currently operates as an FHC, which permits us to engage in a number of financial activities—including securities, insurance, and merchant-banking activities—beyond the business of banking. To maintain our status as an FHC, Ally Bank must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed” as defined under applicable law. If we fail to maintain our status as an FHC, we may be restricted from engaging in the broader range of financial activities permitted for FHCs and may be required to discontinue these activities or even divest Ally Bank. In addition, if we fail to achieve specified ratings under the Community Reinvestment Act, our ability to expand these financial activities could be restricted.In connection with their continuous supervision and examinations, the FRB, the UDFI, the CFPB, the SEC, FINRA, or other regulatory agencies may require changes in our business or operations. Such a requirement may be judicially enforceable or impractical for us to contest, and if we are unable to implement or maintain the requirement in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal or informal supervisory actions, including memoranda of understanding, written agreements, cease-and-desist orders, and prompt-corrective-action or safety-and-soundness directives. Supervisory actions could entail significant restrictions on our existing business, our ability to develop new business, our flexibility in conducting operations, and our ability to pay dividends or utilize capital. Supervisory actions also may result in the imposition of civil monetary penalties, the enforcement of supervisory requirements through injunctions or other administrative or judicial orders, related litigation by private plaintiffs, damage to our reputation, and a loss of investor confidence. We could be required as well to dispose of specified assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. As a result, any supervisory action could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.Our regulatory environment is not static. No assurance can be given that applicable statutes, regulations, or other laws will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws will not be adopted, or that any of these laws will not be enforced more aggressively. Changes in the regulatory environment could adversely affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways, including by limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, increasing the ability of others to offer more competitive financial services and products, restricting our ability to make acquisitions or pursue other profitable opportunities, and negatively impacting our franchise and results of operations. Further, noncompliance with applicable laws could result in the suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations that we need to operate and in the initiation of supervisory actions or private litigation.Our ability to execute our business strategy for Ally Bank may be adversely affected by regulatory constraints.A primary component of our business strategy is the growth of Ally Bank. This planned growth includes shifting more of our automotive lending from Ally to Ally Bank, amassing a higher level of retail deposits, expanding our commercial lending, and introducing additional consumer products such as residential mortgage loans and credit cards. If our banking supervisors raise concerns about any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank or the way in which we implement it—including any associated affiliate transactions that are governed and constrained by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act—we may be obliged to limit or even reverse the growth of Ally Bank or otherwise alter our strategy, which could have an adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects. We also may be adversely affected if our regulatory normalization of Ally Bank does not advance as expected, including a near-term release or reduction of the individual minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio for Ally Bank that had been set at 15% in connection with the acceptance of our membership in the Federal Reserve System. Refer to the section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, if we are compelled to retain or shift any of our business activities in or to nonbank affiliates, our funding costs for those activities—such as unsecured funding in the capital markets—could be more expensive than our cost of funds at Ally Bank.We are subject to stress tests, capital and liquidity planning, and other enhanced prudential standards, which impose significant restrictions and costly requirements on our business and operations.We are subject to the enhanced prudential standards that have been established by the FRB for BHCs with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, including capital planning requirements for large and noncomplex BHCs with total consolidated assets between $50 billion and $250 billion and total nonbank assets of less than $75 billion. As part of these enhanced prudential standards, Ally is subject to supervisory and company-run stress tests and must submit a proposed capital plan to the FRB annually. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. The proposed capital plan must include an assessment of our expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or 11Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kequity capital instrument, any dividend or other capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally’s capital. The proposed capital plan must also include a discussion of how Ally, under expected and stressful conditions, will maintain capital commensurate with its risks and above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to the proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide notice of non-objection to Ally. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB may prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, or making other capital distributions, may compel us to issue capital instruments that could be dilutive to shareholders, may prevent us from maintaining or expanding lending or other business activities, and may damage our reputation and result in a loss of investor confidence.We may be required to raise capital as well if we fail to satisfy our minimum capital ratios or other applicable supervisory requirements, whether due to inadequate operating results that erode capital, future growth that outpaces the accumulation of capital through earnings, changes in regulatory capital standards, or otherwise. In addition, we may elect to raise capital for strategic reasons even when not required to do so. Our ability to raise capital on favorable terms or at all will depend on general economic and market conditions, which are outside of our control, and on our operating and financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot be assured of being able to raise capital when needed or on favorable terms. An inability to raise capital when needed and on favorable terms could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt supervisory actions, and harm our reputation, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Further, if we are able to raise capital and do so by issuing common stock or convertible securities, the ownership interest of our existing shareholders could be diluted, and the market price of our common stock could decline.The enhanced prudential standards also require Ally to conduct liquidity stress tests and maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event, to adopt a contingency funding plan that would address liquidity needs during various stress events, and to implement specified liquidity risk management and corporate governance measures, including requirements, duties, and qualifications for Ally’s risk committee and chief risk officer. These enhanced liquidity standards, together with a quantitative minimum liquidity coverage ratio that we must satisfy as a complement to these standards, could constrain our ability to originate or invest in longer-term or less liquid assets or to take advantage of other profitable opportunities and, therefore, may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and prospects.Additionally, the FRB has proposed rules to implement other enhanced prudential standards mandated by Sections 165 and 166 of the Dodd-Frank Act and related capital and liquidity requirements, including single-counterparty credit limits, an early remediation framework, and a quantitative minimum net stable funding ratio. Once adopted and implemented, these rules also could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and prospects.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank is a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits at Ally Bank as a source of funding. Competition for deposits and deposit customers, however, is fierce and has only intensified with the implementation of enhanced capital and liquidity requirements in the last decade. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network but, instead, obtains its deposits through online and other direct banking as well as through deposit brokers. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher returns. Brokered deposits totaled $12.2 billion at December 31, 2016, which represented 15% of Ally Bank’s total deposits. In addition, our ability to maintain or grow direct banking deposits may be constrained by our lack of in-person banking services, changes in consumer trends, or any loss of confidence in our brand or franchise. Our level of deposits also could be adversely affected by regulatory or supervisory restrictions, including any applicable prior approval requirements or limits on our offered rates or brokered deposit growth. Perceptions of our financial strength, rates or returns offered by other financial institutions or third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base.The full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and other financial-reform laws and policies on us remains unclear and unpredictable but could have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, and other financial-reform laws and policies have substantially changed the legal and supervisory frameworks under which we operate and have adversely affected our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. While much in the Dodd-Frank Act has been implemented, some meaningful provisions remain subject to further rulemaking, transition periods, and the discretion of various regulatory agencies. Even provisions that have been implemented are or may become the subject of interpretive disputes, litigation, or proposed legislative amendments. For example, the CFPB—which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act—has aggressively enforced its positions on a wide range of consumer protection laws that affect our business, including in the context of indirect automotive lending. Some of these positions or their application in particular cases, however, have been contested by affected companies, as has the constitutionality of the structure of the CFPB itself. The outcomes of these matters and their impact on both the meaning of consumer protection laws and the enforcement posture of the CFPB remain unclear and unpredictable but could adversely affect us. Similarly, the full impact of the Dodd-Frank Act and financial-reform laws and policies as whole on us cannot be predicted with any certainty and may not be known for a number of years, but individually or collectively, they may have a further adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. In addition, these laws and policies may impact us differently than other financial institutions due to a number of factors, such as differences in activities, size, risk profile, complexity, or regulatory or supervisory status.12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KRequirements under the U.S. Basel III rules to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital and future revisions to the Basel III framework may adversely affect our business and financial results.In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision reached an agreement on the global Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking agencies finalized rules implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States as well as related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The U.S. Basel III rules represent substantial revisions to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations.Ally and Ally Bank became subject to the U.S. Basel III rules on January 1, 2015, although a number of them—including new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions—are being phased in over several years. The U.S. Basel III rules subject Ally and Ally Bank to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The U.S. Basel III rules also will, over time, impose more stringent deductions for specified DTAs and other assets and limit our ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities or other hybrid securities.If Ally or Ally Bank were to fail to satisfy its regulatory capital requirements, significant regulatory sanctions could result, such as a bar on acquisitions or new activities, a loss of our status as an FHC, informal or formal supervisory actions, or even resolution or receivership. Any of these sanctions could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.The Basel Committee, moreover, continues to consider revisions to the global Basel III capital framework, many of which would heighten regulatory capital standards even more. No assurance can be provided that these revisions—if adopted in the United States—would not further impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects in an adverse way.Our business and financial results could be adversely affected by the political environment and governmental fiscal and monetary policies.A fractious or volatile political environment in the United States, including any related social unrest, could negatively impact business and market conditions, economic growth, financial stability, and business, consumer, investor, and regulatory sentiments, any one or more of which in turn could cause our business and financial results to suffer. In addition, disruptions in the foreign relations of the United States could adversely affect the automotive and other industries on which our business depends and our tax positions and other dealings in foreign countries.Our business and financial results are also significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States in pursuit of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The FRB and its policies influence the availability and demand for loans and deposits, the rates and other terms for loans and deposits, the conditions in equity, fixed-income, currency, and other markets, and the value of securities and other financial instruments. These actions and policies, therefore, could adversely affect every facet of our business and operations—for example, the new and used vehicle financing market, the cost of our deposits and other interest-bearing liabilities, and the yield on our earning assets. Tax and other fiscal policies, moreover, impact not only general economic conditions but also give rise to incentives or disincentives that affect how we and our customers prioritize objectives, deploy resources, and run households or operate businesses. Both the timing and the nature of any changes in monetary or fiscal policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adversely affect our business and financial results.If our ability to receive distributions from subsidiaries is restricted, we may not be able to satisfy our obligations to counterparties or creditors, make dividend payments to shareholders, or repurchase our common stock.Ally is a legal entity separate and distinct from its bank and nonbank subsidiaries and, in part, depends on dividend payments and other distributions from those subsidiaries to fund its obligations to counterparties and creditors, its dividend payments to shareholders, and its repurchases of common stock. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Regulatory or other legal restrictions, deterioration in a subsidiary’s performance, or investments in a subsidiary’s own growth may limit the ability of the subsidiary to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Ally’s subsidiaries are subject to laws that authorize their supervisory agencies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally. In addition, if any subsidiary were unable to remain viable as a going concern, Ally’s right to participate in a distribution of assets would be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary’s creditors (including, in the case of Ally Bank, its depositors and the FDIC).Risks Related to Our BusinessWeak or deteriorating economic conditions, failures in underwriting, changes in underwriting standards, financial or systemic shocks, or growth in our nonprime financing business could increase our credit risk, which could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our business is centered around lending and banking, and a significant percentage of our assets are composed of loans, leases, and securities. As a result, credit risk is among our most pronounced risks.13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business and financial results depend significantly on household, business, economic, and market conditions. When those conditions are weak or deteriorating, we could simultaneously experience reduced demand for credit and increased delinquencies or defaults, including in the loans that we have securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. These kinds of conditions also could dampen the demand for products and services in our insurance, banking, brokerage, and other businesses. Increased delinquencies or defaults could result as well from us failing to appropriately underwrite loans that we originate or purchase or from us adopting—for strategic, competitive, or other reasons—more liberal underwriting standards. If delinquencies or defaults on our loans increase, their value and the income derived from them could be adversely affected, and we could incur increased administrative and other costs in seeking a recovery on claims and any collateral. If unfavorable conditions are negatively affecting used vehicle or other collateral values at the same time, the amount and timing of recoveries could suffer as well. Weak or deteriorating economic conditions also may negatively impact the market value and liquidity of our investment securities, and we may be required to record additional impairment charges that negatively impact earnings if investment securities suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-temporary. There can be no assurance that our monitoring of our credit risk and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting and investment policies, loss-mitigation strategies, and diversification are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact to our business and financial results. A financial or systemic shock and a failure of a significant counterparty or a significant group of counterparties could negatively impact us as well, possibly to a severe degree, due to our role as a financial intermediary and the interconnectedness of the financial system.Our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financings has increased and we have seen some deterioration in nonprime credit tiers compared to prime credit tiers. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. In addition, we have increased our used vehicle financing. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our Automotive Finance operations nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $9.1 billion, or approximately 13.8% of our total consumer automotive loans, at December 31, 2016, as compared to $9.0 billion, or approximately 14.0% of our total consumer automotive loans, at December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2016, and 2015, $211 million and $161 million, respectively, of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our accounting policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If our exposure to nonprime consumer automotive financing loans continues to increase over time, our credit risk will increase to a possibly significant degree. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, we may experience increased credit risk from having engaged in the transaction.We have dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses, and a change in the key role of dealers within the automotive industry or our ability to maintain or build relationships with them could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Our Dealer Financial Services business, which includes our Automotive Finance and Insurance segments, depends on the continuation of the key role of dealers within the automotive industry, the maintenance of our existing relationships with dealers, and our creation of new relationships with dealers. Refer to the section titled Our Business in the MD&A that follows.A number of trends are affecting the automotive industry and the role of dealers within it. These include challenges to the dealer’s role as intermediary between manufacturers and purchasers, the rise of vehicle sharing and ride hailing, the development of autonomous and alternative-energy vehicles, the impact of demographic shifts on attitudes and behaviors toward vehicle ownership and use, changing expectations around the vehicle buying experience, adjustments in the geographic distribution of new and used vehicle sales, and advancements in communications technology. Any one or more of these trends could adversely affect the key role of dealers and their business models, profitability, and viability, and if this were to occur, our dealer-centric automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer as well.While the number of dealers with whom we have retail relationships increased during 2016, the number of dealers with whom we have wholesale relationships decreased approximately 3% as compared to December 31, 2015. Further, our share of commercial wholesale financing remains at risk of decreasing in the future. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with significant automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason—including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis, offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, or compete successfully with the products and services of our competitors—our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with whom we have retail funding relationships, could decline in the future. If this occurs, our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects could be adversely affected.GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base, which creates concentration risk for us.While we are continuing to diversify our automotive finance and insurance businesses and to expand into other financial services, GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers continue to constitute a significant portion of our customer base. In 2016, 54% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 36% of our vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for GM-franchised dealers and customers, and 32% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 28% of our vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were transacted for Chrysler dealers and customers. GM, Chrysler, and their captive finance companies compete forcefully with us and could take further actions that negatively impact the amount of business that we do with GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers. Further, a 14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Ksignificant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s business—including, for example, in the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles, GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers, or the rate or volume of recalls of GM or Chrysler vehicles—could negatively impact our GM and Chrysler dealer and retail customer bases. Any future reductions in GM and Chrysler business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our business and financial results.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to significantly increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses and which represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. Any increase in the allowance results in an associated decrease in net income and capital and, if significant, may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may change substantially over time. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, revisions to accounting rules and related guidance, new qualitative or quantitative information about existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, changes in the size or composition of our loan portfolio, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, our shift to a full credit spectrum retail automotive finance portfolio mix has increased our allowance for loan losses and will likely increase our allowance for loan losses in the future.The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued Accounting Standards Update 2016-13, Financial Instruments — Credit Losses, which introduces a new accounting model to measure credit losses for financial assets measured at amortized cost. The amendments, effective on January 1, 2020, represent a significant departure from existing accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), which upon adoption are likely to substantially increase our allowance for loan losses with a resulting negative adjustment to equity. This increase to the allowance for loan losses could also adversely impact capital if the FRB and other banking agencies do not amend existing regulatory capital rules to relieve us from the capital impact associated with the adoption of this guidance.Regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses, and from time to time may insist on an increase in the allowance for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs based on judgments different than those of management. If these differences in judgment are considerable, our allowance could meaningfully increase and result in a sizable decrease in our net income and capital.Our business and financial results are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our automotive finance and insurance businesses can be impacted by sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, household income, credit availability, and fuel costs. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2008 and did not rebound significantly until 2012 and 2013. Any future declines in new or used vehicle sales could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.The levels of or changes in interest rates could affect our results of operations and financial condition.We are highly dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest income on earning assets (such as loans and investments) and interest expense on deposits and borrowings. Net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest, which in turn are influenced by monetary and fiscal policies, general economic conditions, the regulatory environment, competitive pressures, and expectations about future changes in interest rates. We may be adversely affected by policies, laws, or events that have the effect of flattening or inverting the yield curve (that is, the difference between long-term and short-term interest rates), depressing the interest rates associated with our earning assets to levels near the rates associated with our interest expense, or changing the spreads among different interest rate indices.The levels of or changes in interest rates could adversely affect us beyond our net interest income, including the following:•increase the cost or decrease the availability of deposits or other variable-rate funding instruments;•reduce the return on or demand for loans or increase the prepayment speed of loans;•increase customer or counterparty delinquencies or defaults;•negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease and repossessed vehicles; and•reduce the value of our loans, retained interests in securitizations, and fixed-income securities in our investment portfolio and the efficacy of our hedging strategies.The level of and changes in market rates of interest—and, as a result, these risks and uncertainties—are beyond our control. The dynamics among these risks and uncertainties are also challenging to assess and manage. For example, while the highly accommodative 15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kmonetary policy currently adopted by the FRB may benefit us to some degree by spurring economic activity among our customers, such a policy may ultimately cause us more harm by inhibiting our ability to grow or sustain net interest income. Refer to the section titled Market Risk in the MD&A that follows and Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.A failure of or interruption in, as well as cyber and other security risks associated with, the communications and other information systems on which we rely to conduct our business and operations could adversely affect us.We rely heavily upon communications and other information systems to conduct our business and operations, which creates meaningful operational risk for us. Any failure of or interruption in our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely—including as a result of inadequate or failed technology or processes, human errors, fraud or other misconduct by employees or service providers, deficiencies in the integration of acquisitions or commencement of new businesses, catastrophic events, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, misplaced or lost data, or breakdowns in business continuity plans—could cause failures or delays in receiving applications for loans, underwriting or processing loans, servicing loans, accessing online bank accounts, processing transactions, executing brokerage orders, managing our investment portfolio, or conducting our internal operations. As a digital financial services company, we are susceptible to business, reputational, financial, regulatory, or other harm as a result of these risks.In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, and transmit sensitive, confidential, or proprietary data or other information, including business information, intellectual property, and the personally identifiable information of customers and employees. The secure processing, storage, maintenance, and transmission of this information is critical to our operations and reputation, and if any of this information were mishandled, misused, improperly accessed, lost, or stolen or if our operations were disabled or otherwise disrupted, we could suffer significant business, reputational, financial, regulatory, or other damage. For example, despite security measures, our communications and other information systems could be susceptible to computer viruses or malware, pretext calls, electronic phishing, hacking, identity theft, or other intrusions. Information security risks for large financial institutions like us are rapidly evolving and increasing in scope and complexity, in part, because of the introduction of new technologies, the expanded use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate with no warning from a wide variety of sources around the globe. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Service providers and counterparties also present a source of risk to us if their own security measures or other systems or infrastructure were to be breached or otherwise fail. Likewise, a cyber-attack or other security breach affecting the business community, the markets, or parts of them may cycle or cascade through the financial system and adversely affect us. Many if not all of these risks and uncertainties are beyond our control. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Even when a failure of or interruption in our communications or other information systems is timely resolved or an attempted cyber incident or other security breach is successfully avoided or thwarted, we may need to expend substantial resources in doing so, may be required to take actions that could adversely affect customer satisfaction or behavior, and may be exposed to reputational damage. In the case of a failure, interruption, or breach, moreover, we could be exposed to contractual claims, regulatory actions, or litigation by private plaintiffs.We are heavily reliant on technology, and a failure in effectively implementing technology initiatives or anticipating future technology needs or demands could adversely affect our business or financial results.We significantly depend on technology to deliver our products and other services and to otherwise conduct business. To remain technologically competitive and operationally efficient, we invest in system upgrades, new solutions, and other technology initiatives. Many of these initiatives take a significant amount of time to develop and implement, are tied to critical systems, and require substantial resources. Although we take steps to mitigate the risks and uncertainties associated with these initiatives, no assurance can be provided that they will be implemented on time, within budget, or without negative operational or customer impact. We also may not succeed in anticipating future technology needs, the technology demands of customers, or the competitive landscape for technology. If we were to misstep in any of these areas, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted.Our risk-management and compliance programs or functions may not be effective in mitigating risk and loss. We maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to identify, quantify, monitor, report, and control the risks that we face. These include credit, insurance/underwriting, vehicle-residual, market, liquidity, business/strategic, reputation, and operational risks. We also maintain a compliance program to identify, measure, assess, and report on our adherence to applicable law, policies, and procedures. There can be no assurance that our frameworks or models for risk management, compliance, and related controls will effectively mitigate risk and limit losses in our business. If conditions or circumstances arise that expose flaws or gaps in our risk management or compliance programs or if our controls break down, the performance and value of our business could be adversely affected. We could be negatively impacted as well if, despite adequate programs being in place, our risk management or compliance personnel are ineffective in executing them and mitigating risk and loss. Refer to the section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.We are or may be subject to potential liability in connection with pending or threatened legal proceedings and other matters, which could adversely affect our business or financial results.We are involved from time to time in a variety of judicial, alternative-dispute, and other proceedings arising out of our business and operations. These legal matters may be formal or informal and include litigation and arbitration with one or more identified claimants, 16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kcertified or purported class actions with yet-to-be-identified claimants, and regulatory or other governmental information-gathering requests, examinations, investigations, and enforcement proceedings. Our legal matters exist in varying stages of adjudication, arbitration, negotiation, or investigation and span our lines of business and operations. Claims may be based in law or equity—such as those arising under contracts or in tort and those involving banking, consumer protection, securities, tax, employment, and other laws—and some can present novel legal theories and allege substantial or indeterminate damages.The course and outcome of legal matters are inherently unpredictable. This is especially so when a matter is still in its early stages, the damages sought are indeterminate or unsupported, significant facts are unclear or disputed, novel questions of law or other meaningful legal uncertainties exist, a request to certify a proceeding as a class action is outstanding or granted, multiple parties are named, or regulatory or other governmental entities are involved. As a result, we cannot state with confidence how or when threatened or pending legal matters will be resolved and what losses may be incurred. Actual losses may be higher or lower than any amounts accrued for those matters, possibly to a significant degree. Refer to Note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, while we maintain insurance policies to mitigate the cost of litigation and other proceedings, these policies have deductibles, limits, and exclusions that may diminish their value or efficacy. Substantial legal claims, even if not meritorious, could have a detrimental impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition and could cause us reputational harm.Our inability to attract, retain, or motivate qualified employees could adversely affect our business or performance.Skilled employees are our most important resource, and competition for talented people is intense. Even though compensation is among our highest expenses, we may not be able to locate and hire the best people, keep them with us, or properly motivate them to perform at a high level. Recent scrutiny of compensation practices, especially in the financial services industry, has made this only more difficult. In addition, many parts of our business are particularly dependent on key personnel. If we were to lose and find ourselves unable to replace these personnel or other skilled employees or if the competition for talent were to drive our compensation costs to unsustainable levels, our business and financial results could be negatively impacted.Our ability to successfully make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including the risk that government authorities will not provide the requisite approvals, the risk that integrating acquisitions may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and the risk that the value of acquisitions may be less than anticipated.While currently not a strategic priority, we may from time to time seek to make opportunistic acquisitions of other financial services companies or businesses. These acquisitions may be subject to regulatory approval, and no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain that approval in a timely manner or at all. Even when we are able to obtain regulatory approval, the failure of other closing conditions to be satisfied or waived could delay the completion of an acquisition for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring altogether. Any failure or delay in closing an acquisition could adversely affect our reputation, business, and performance.In addition, acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including lower-than-expected performance or higher-than-expected costs, difficulties related to integration, diversion of management’s attention from other business activities, changes in relationships with customers or counterparties, and the potential loss of key employees. An acquisition also could be dilutive to our existing shareholders if we were to issue common stock to fully or partially pay or fund the purchase price. We, moreover, may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates, integrating acquired companies or businesses, or realizing expected value from acquisitions. There is significant competition for valuable acquisition targets, and we may not be able to acquire other companies or businesses on attractive terms. No assurance can be given that we will pursue future acquisitions, and our ability to grow and successfully compete may be impaired if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions.Vehicle loans and leases make up a significant part of our earning assets, and our business and financial results could suffer if used vehicle prices are low or volatile or decrease in the future.During the year ended December 31, 2016, more than 85% of our earning assets were composed of vehicle loans or leases or related residual securitization interests. If we experience higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles or lower or more volatile residual values for off-lease vehicles, our business or financial results could be adversely affected.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price, the vehicle disposition channel, volatility in gasoline or diesel fuel prices, levels of household income, and other factors outside of our control heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, when the recent economic crisis began in 2008, sharp declines in used vehicle demand and sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle—as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination—is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we will incur additional depreciation expense and lower profit on the lease transaction than our priced expectation. Our expectation of levels of used vehicle values is also combined with our estimate of loss frequency to arrive at our projected net average annualized loss rate (NAALR), which is a factor in determining our pricing of new loan and lease originations. To the extent that used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our profit on vehicle loans and leases could be substantially less than our expectations, even more so if our estimate of loss frequency is underestimated as well. In addition, we could be adversely affected if we fail to 17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kefficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles and repossessed vehicles and, as a consequence, incur higher-than-expected disposal costs or lower-than-expected proceeds from the vehicle sales.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and a disruption in our funding sources or access to the capital markets may have an adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Liquidity is the ability to fund increases in assets and meet obligations as they come due, all without incurring unacceptable losses. Banks are especially vulnerable to liquidity risk because of their role in the maturity transformation of demand or short-term deposits into longer-term loans or other extensions of credit. We, like other financial services companies, rely to a significant extent on external sources of funding (such as deposits and borrowings) for the liquidity needed to conduct our business and operations. A number of factors beyond our control, however, could have a detrimental impact on the availability or cost of that funding and thus on our liquidity. These include market disruptions, changes in our credit ratings or the sentiment of our investors, the state of the regulatory environment and monetary and fiscal policies, reputational damage, financial or systemic shocks, and significant counterparty failures. Unexpected declines or limits on dividends or other distributions from our subsidiaries also could adversely affect Ally’s liquidity position.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it remains an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2016, approximately $4.4 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2017, and approximately $3.7 billion and $1.7 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2016, a total of $3.6 billion in principal amount of demand notes were outstanding. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2016, approximately $10.3 billion of outstanding consolidated secured long-term debt is scheduled to mature in 2017, approximately $8.2 billion is scheduled to mature in 2018, and approximately $7.3 billion is scheduled to mature in 2019. Furthermore, at December 31, 2016, approximately $16.2 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2017, which is not included in the 2017 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a substantial portion of the debt maturities over these periods.We continue to rely as well on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions, tightening of credit availability, or other events referenced earlier in this risk factor could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and could increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While those markets have continued to stabilize following the liquidity crisis that commenced in 2008, there can be no assurances that these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our policies and controls are designed to ensure that we maintain adequate liquidity to conduct our business in the ordinary course even in a stressed environment. There is no guarantee, however, that our liquidity position will never become compromised. In such an event, we may be required to sell assets at a loss or reduce loan and lease originations in order to continue operations. This could damage the performance and value of our business, prompt regulatory intervention, and harm our reputation, and if the condition were to persist for any appreciable period of time, our viability as a going concern could be threatened. Refer to section titled Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital in the MD&A that follows and Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could adversely affect our business and financial results.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $67.9 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $43.2 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 22% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2016. We also have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness.If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions. In addition, if we are unable to satisfy our indebtedness and other obligations in full and on time, our business, reputation, and value as a going concern could be profoundly and perhaps inexorably damaged.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, mortgage, banking, and brokerage are extremely competitive, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business and financial results.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, mortgage, banking, and brokerage are highly competitive, and we expect competitive pressures only to intensify in the future, especially in light of legislative and regulatory initiatives arising out of the recent global economic crisis, technological innovations that alter the barriers to entry, current and evolving economic and market conditions, and government monetary and fiscal policies. Refer to the section above titled Industry and Competition in Part I, Item 1 of this report. Competitive pressures may drive us to take actions that we might otherwise eschew, such as lowering the interest rates or fees on loans, raising the interest rates on deposits, or adopting more liberal underwriting standards. These pressures also may accelerate actions that we might otherwise elect to defer, such as substantial investments in technology or infrastructure. Whatever the reason, actions that we take in response to competition may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These consequences could be exacerbated if we are not successful in 18Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kintroducing new products and other services, achieving market acceptance of our products and other services, developing and maintaining a strong customer base, or prudently managing expenses.Our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could be negatively impacted if our credit ratings are downgraded or otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands.The cost and availability of our funding are meaningfully affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., Fitch, Inc., and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates some or all of our debt, and these ratings reflect the rating agency’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Some of our current credit ratings are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the banking and capital markets. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded further or were to otherwise fail to meet investor expectations or demands, our borrowing costs and access to the banking and capital markets could become even more challenging and, as a result, negatively affect our business and financial results. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings or their failure to meet investor expectations or demands could result in additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as trigger disadvantageous provisions of existing borrowing arrangements.Challenging business, economic, or market conditions may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our businesses are driven by wealth creation in the economy, robust market activity, monetary and fiscal stability, and positive investor, business, and consumer sentiment. A downturn in economic conditions, disruptions in the equity or debt markets, high unemployment or underemployment, depressed vehicle or housing prices, unsustainable debt levels, declines in household incomes, deteriorating consumer or business sentiment, consumer or commercial bankruptcy filings, or declines in the strength of national or local economies could decrease demand for our products and services, increase the amount and rate of delinquencies and losses, and negatively impact the returns on and the value of our investment portfolio and other assets. Further, if a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices or other adverse conditions were to lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases, our automotive finance and insurance businesses could suffer considerably. In addition, concerns about the pace of economic growth and uncertainty about fiscal and monetary policies can result in significant volatility in the financial markets and could impact our ability to obtain cost-effective funding. If any of these events were to occur or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Acts or threats of terrorism, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control could adversely affect us.Geopolitical conditions, natural disasters, and other conditions or events beyond our control may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects. For example, acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken in response to terrorism could adversely affect general economic, business, or market conditions and, in turn, us. We also could be negatively impacted if our key personnel, a significant number of our employees, or our systems or infrastructure were to become unavailable or damaged due to a pandemic, natural disaster, war, act of terrorism, accident, or similar cause. These same risks and uncertainties arise too for the service providers and counterparties on whom we depend as well as their own third-party service providers and counterparties.Significant repurchases or indemnification payments in our securitizations or whole-loan sales could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase and indemnification obligations in our securitizations and whole-loan sales. If we were to breach a representation, warranty, or covenant in connection with a securitization or whole-loan sale, we may be required to repurchase the affected loans or leases or otherwise compensate investors or purchasers for losses caused by the breach. If the scale or frequency of repurchases or indemnification payments were to increase substantially from its present levels, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.Our business and operations make extensive use of models, and we could be adversely affected if our design, implementation, or use of models is flawed.We use quantitative models to price products and services, measure risk, estimate asset and liability values, assess capital and liquidity, manage our balance sheet, create financial forecasts, and otherwise conduct our business and operations. If the design, implementation, or use of any of these models is flawed, we could make strategic or tactical decisions based on incorrect, misleading, or incomplete information. In addition, to the extent that any inaccurate model outputs are used in reports to banking agencies or the public, we could be subjected to supervisory actions, litigation, and other proceedings that may adversely affect our business and financial results. Refer to section titled Risk Management in the MD&A that follows.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks, which could adversely affect our financial results.We employ various hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate, foreign exchange, and market risks inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely considerably on assumptions and projections regarding our assets and liabilities as well as general market factors. If any of these assumptions or projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and other market factors, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely 19Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kaffect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties on acceptable terms or at all, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including retained interests from securitizations, loans held-for-sale, and other investments that do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses (which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements). Refer to section titled Critical Accounting Estimates in the MD&A that follows. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons. For example, they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (such as macroeconomic conditions and their impact on our dealers) and often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. Assumptions and estimates are also far more difficult during periods of market dislocation or illiquidity. As a result, our actual experience may differ substantially from these estimates and assumptions. A meaningful difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects and may increase the volatility of our financial results. In addition, several different judgments associated with assumptions or estimates could be reasonable under the circumstances and yet result in significantly different results being reported.Significant fluctuations in the valuation of investment securities or market prices could negatively affect our financial results.Market prices for securities and other financial assets are subject to considerable fluctuation. Fluctuations may result, for example, from perceived changes in the value of the asset, the relative price of alternative investments, geopolitical events, actual or expected changes in monetary or fiscal policies, and general market conditions. Due to these kinds of fluctuations, the amount that we realize in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the last reported value and could negatively affect our financial results. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity.Changes in accounting standards could adversely affect our reported revenues, expenses, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised or expanded. The application of GAAP is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB, the SEC, banking agencies, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes are beyond our control but could adversely affect our revenues, expenses, profitability, or financial condition. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for several financial accounting standards issued by the FASB during 2016 with effective dates between January 1, 2018, and January 1, 2020.The financial system is highly interrelated, and the failure of even a single financial institution could adversely affect us.The financial system is highly interrelated, including as a result of lending, trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to and routinely execute transactions with a wide variety of financial institutions, including brokers, dealers, commercial banks, and investment banks. If any of these institutions were to fail in meeting its obligations in full and on time or were to enter bankruptcy, conservatorship, or receivership, the consequences could ripple throughout the financial system and may adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, or prospects.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in the states where we have loan or lease concentrations may negatively affect our business and financial results.We are exposed to portfolio concentrations in some states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Negative publicity outside of our control, or our failure to successfully manage issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our business or financial results.The performance and value of our business could be negatively impacted by any reputational harm that we may suffer. This harm could arise from negative publicity outside of our control or our failure to adequately address issues arising from our conduct or in connection with the financial services industry generally. Risks to our reputation could arise in any number of contexts—for example, continuing government responses to the recent global economic crisis, cyber incidents and other security breaches, mergers and acquisitions, lending or banking practices, actual or potential conflicts of interest, failures to prevent money laundering, and corporate governance.20Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares in the future may be limited.Any future dividends on our common stock or share repurchases will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on our business, financial condition, earnings, capital, liquidity, and other factors at the time. In addition, any plans to continue dividends or share repurchases in the future will be subject to the FRB’s review of and non-objection to our capital plan, which is unpredictable. Refer to the section above titled Regulation and Supervision in Part I, Item 1 of this report. There is no assurance that our Board of Directors will approve, or the FRB will permit, future dividends or share repurchases.It is possible that any indentures or other financing arrangements that we execute in the future could limit our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing arrangements in the future restrict that ability, we may be unable to pay dividends unless and until we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those arrangements. In addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory surplus (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital) or, if no surplus exists, out of our net profits for the then-current or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash or regulatory approvals to do so.The market price of our common stock could be adversely impacted by anti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law that could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of Ally or and by other banking, antitrust, or corporate laws that have or are perceived as having an anti-takeover effect.Our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of discouraging, hindering, or preventing an acquisition that our Board of Directors does not find to be in the best interests of us and our stockholders. For example, our organizational documents include provisions:•limiting the liability of our directors and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and•limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings of stockholders by requiring any requesting stockholders to hold at least 25% of our common shares in the aggregate.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of Ally or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any interested stockholder (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under specified circumstances such as the receipt of prior board approval.Banking and antitrust laws, including associated regulatory-approval requirements, also impose significant restrictions on the acquisition of direct or indirect control over any bank holding company like us.Any provision of our organizational documents or applicable law that deters, hinders, or prevents a non-negotiated takeover or change in control of Ally could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock"
7,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2016-02-24,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
Our businesses face many risks and uncertainties, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties that we face are described below. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to RegulationThe regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.We are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require significant expense and devotion of resources, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Ally currently operates as a FHC, which permits us to engage in certain business activities, including securities, insurance, and merchant banking activities. To maintain status as a FHC, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” as defined under applicable law. If we fail to maintain our status as a FHC, our ability to engage in the broader range of activities permitted to FHCs may be restricted and we may be required to discontinue these activities, or divest our bank subsidiary, Ally Bank.Ally is subject to ongoing supervision, examination and regulation by the FRB, and Ally Bank by the FDIC and the Utah DFI, in each case, through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify, assess, and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe-and-sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations, including those governing resolution planning. In the course of their supervision and examinations, our regulators may require improvements in various functions or areas of our business. Any requirement imposed is generally judicially enforceable, and if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal supervisory actions that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to develop any new business. Such forms of supervisory action could include, without limitation, written agreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and enforcement of such action through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to the affected product and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, or that we will not be prohibited by local laws or regulators from taking desired actions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, or results of operations.Changes to any applicable statutes, regulations, rules, or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing financial services and products. Further, noncompliance with applicable laws could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.8Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KFor additional information related to our regulatory requirements, see Business — Certain Regulatory Matters.Ally and its subsidiaries are or may become involved in investigations, examinations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies, which may lead to material adverse consequences.Ally and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are or may become involved from time to time in formal and informal reviews, investigations, examinations, proceedings, and information-gathering requests by federal and state government and self-regulatory agencies, including, among others, the DOJ, SEC, CFPB, FRB, FDIC, Utah DFI, and the Federal Trade Commission regarding their respective operations.Mortgage MattersWe have received subpoenas from the DOJ that include a broad request for documentation and other information relating to residential mortgage-backed securities issued by our former mortgage subsidiary, Residential Capital, LLC and its subsidiaries (ResCap RMBS). In connection with these requests, the DOJ is investigating potential fraud and other potential legal claims related to ResCap RMBS, including its investigation of potential claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. The DOJ is also investigating potential claims under the False Claims Act (FCA) related to representations made by us in connection with investments in Ally made by the United States Department of the Treasury pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008 and 2009 regarding certain claims against Residential Capital, LLC or its subsidiaries at that time. We continue to engage in discussions with the DOJ with respect to legal and factual aspects of their investigations and potential claims. As previously disclosed, at the request of the DOJ, we entered into an agreement to voluntarily extend the statutes of limitations related to potential FCA claims. This agreement expired at the end of January 2016. We have separately received subpoenas and document requests from the SEC that include information covering a wide range of mortgage-related matters. Automotive Subprime MattersIn October 2014, we received a document request from the SEC in connection with its investigation related to subprime automotive finance and related securitization activities. Separately, in December 2014, we received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting similar information. In May 2015, we received an information request from the New York Department of Financial Services requesting similar information. We have cooperated with each of these agencies with respect to these matters.CFPBFurther, in December 2013, Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank entered into Consent Orders issued by the CFPB and the DOJ pertaining to the allegation of disparate impact in the automotive finance business. The Consent Orders require Ally to create a compliance plan addressing, at a minimum, the communication of Ally’s expectations of Equal Credit Opportunity Act compliance to dealers, maintenance of Ally’s existing limits on dealer finance income for contracts acquired by Ally, and monitoring for potential discrimination both at the dealer level and within our portfolio of contracts acquired across all dealers. Ally formed a compliance committee consisting of certain Ally and Ally Bank directors to oversee Ally’s execution of the Consent Orders’ terms. Ally is required to meet certain stipulations under the Consent Orders, including a requirement to make monetary payments when ongoing remediation targets are not attained.Each of the matters set forth above may result in material adverse consequences including without limitation, adverse judgments, significant settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions.Our ability to execute our business strategy may be affected by regulatory considerations.Our business strategy for Ally Bank, which is primarily focused on automotive lending, growth of our direct-channel deposit business, bulk purchases of high-quality jumbo mortgage loans, and commercial lending, is subject to regulatory oversight from a safety and soundness perspective. If our banking supervisors raise concerns regarding any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank, we may be obliged to alter our strategy, which could include moving certain activities, such as certain types of lending, outside of Ally Bank to one of our nonbanking affiliates. Alternative funding sources outside of Ally Bank, such as unsecured funding in the capital markets, could be more expensive than funding through Ally Bank and could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to capital planning and systemic risk regimes, which impose significant restrictions and requirements.As a BHC with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets, Ally is subject to certain enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act for large bank holding companies such as Ally. As part of these enhanced prudential standards, Ally is required to conduct periodic stress tests and submit a proposed capital action plan to the FRB annually. The proposed capital action plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally’s consolidated capital. The proposed capital action plan must also include a discussion of how Ally will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to a proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide notice of non-objection to Ally. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB would prohibit us from paying dividends, repurchasing our common stock, and making other capital distributions. Refer to the section above titled Business — Certain Regulatory Matters for further details.9Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KIn addition, the enhanced prudential standards also require Ally to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event and implement various liquidity-related corporate governance measures and imposes certain requirements, duties and qualifications for Ally’s risk committee and chief risk officer. These enhanced prudential standards could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the FRB has stated that it will issue, at a later date, final rules to implement certain other enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, including single counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework. Once implemented and adopted, these rules could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our funding strategy, and we place great reliance on deposits as a source of funding through Ally Bank. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network. It obtains its deposits through direct banking as well as brokered deposits. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher interest rates. Brokered deposits totaled $10.7 billion at December 31, 2015, which represented 16% of Ally Bank total deposits. Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected by regulatory restrictions, including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements, restrictions on deposit growth, or restrictions on our rates offered. In addition, perceptions of our financial strength, rates offered by third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base. In addition, our regulators may impose restrictions on our ability to fund certain types of assets at Ally Bank, potentially raising the cost of funding those activities without the use of Ally Bank deposits. Qualitative and quantitative liquidity requirements imposed by the U.S. banking regulators may also impact our funding strategy.Financial services legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has and will continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate. Certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, and others have become effective since enactment, while others are subject to further rulemaking, transition periods, and the discretion of various regulatory bodies. The Dodd-Frank Act has had, and will continue to have as its provisions are further implemented, material implications for Ally and the entire financial services industry. Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act and its implementing regulations:•subject Ally to enhanced prudential standards, oversight, and scrutiny as a result of being a BHC with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (a large BHC);•have increased the levels of capital and liquidity with which Ally must operate and affect how it plans capital and liquidity levels;•subject Ally to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees paid by Ally Bank to the FDIC;•require Ally to provide to the FRB and FDIC an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress;•subject Ally to regulation and examination by the CFPB, which has very broad rule-making, examination, and enforcement authorities; and•subject derivatives that Ally enters into for hedging, risk management and other purposes to a comprehensive new regulatory regime which, when fully implemented, will require central clearing and execution on designated markets or execution facilities for certain standardized derivatives and impose margin, documentation, trade reporting and other new requirements.These and other requirements may, either currently or in the future, impact Ally’s business and risk management strategies and/or restrict the revenue that Ally generates from certain businesses.While U.S. regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, they plan to propose or finalize additional regulations for implementation in the future. In light of the further rulemaking required to fully implement the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the discretion afforded to federal regulators, the full impact of this legislation on Ally, its business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years. In addition, regulations may impact us differently in comparison to other more established financial institutions. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are likely to adversely affect Ally and its financial performance. The extent to which Ally can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not knowable at this time.10Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business may be adversely affected by the revised capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III final rules.In December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on the Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators finalized rules implementing the U.S. Basel III capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Act provisions. The U.S. Basel III final rules represent substantial revisions to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. Ally became subject to the U.S. Basel III final rules beginning on January 1, 2015. Certain aspects of the U.S. Basel III final rules, including new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions, will be phased in over several years. The U.S. Basel III final rules subject Ally to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on Ally’s ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.The U.S. Basel III final rules will, over time, require more stringent deductions for, among other assets, certain DTAs from Ally’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital and limit Ally’s ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities, or other “hybrid” securities (although certain debt or equity issued to the U.S. government under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act are grandfathered as Tier 1 capital).If we or Ally Bank fail to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, we or Ally Bank may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to informal or formal supervisory actions by the FRB and/or FDIC and, potentially, FDIC receivership of Ally Bank. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. To maintain its status as a FHC, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” as defined under applicable law.For the 2016 capital planning and stress testing cycle, the Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests and FRB supervisory stress tests to which Ally is subject, the annual capital plan that Ally must submit and the FRB’s annual post-stress capital analysis under the CCAR must incorporate the more stringent capital requirements in the U.S. Basel III final rules as they are phased in over the nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon. Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, an objection to a large BHC's capital plan would prohibit it from paying dividends or making certain other capital distributions.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by governmental fiscal and monetary policies.Our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The FRB’s policies influence the new and used vehicle financing market, which significantly affects the earnings of our businesses. The FRB’s policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the impact of affiliate transaction restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions.Certain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank “affiliates,” including but not limited to Ally Financial Inc., are subject to restrictions under Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and regulations adopted thereunder. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, “covered transactions,” including Ally Bank’s extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its nonbank affiliates, generally (1) are limited to 10% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus with respect to transactions with any individual affiliate, with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus for all affiliates and all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credit transactions, are subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a “low quality asset” under federal banking guidelines; and (4) must be conducted in accordance with safe-and-sound banking practices (collectively, the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). Furthermore, the Affiliate Transactions Restrictions contain an “attribution rule” that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party must be treated as a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, a nonbank affiliate of Ally Bank.Under the Dodd-Frank Act, among other changes to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, credit exposures resulting from derivatives transactions, securities lending and borrowing transactions, and acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral for a loan or extension of credit will be treated as “covered transactions.” The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized and places limits on acceptable collateral.The ability to grow Ally Bank’s business in the future could be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions.11Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KAlly Financial Inc. may be limited in its ability to receive distributions from its subsidiaries.Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit the ability of Ally Financial Inc.’s subsidiaries to transfer funds freely to Ally Financial Inc. In particular, many of Ally Financial Inc.’s subsidiaries are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to it or that prohibit such transfers entirely in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations, and rules may hinder Ally Financial Inc.’s ability to access funds that it may need to make payments on its obligations in the future. Furthermore, as a BHC, Ally Financial Inc. may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on its ability to pay dividends. The bank regulators have the authority and, under certain circumstances, the duty to prohibit or to limit payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ally Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe are exposed to consumer credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. Furthermore, a weak economic environment and high unemployment rates could exert pressure on our consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions, and losses, and could also increase delinquencies and losses related to mortgage loans that we hold for investment. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies, and loss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent an adverse impact in our profitability and financial condition. We have continued to grow our nonprime automotive financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO® Score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. In addition, we have increased our used vehicle financing. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO® Scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. The carrying value of our Automotive Finance operations nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $9.0 billion, or approximately 14.0% of our total consumer automotive loans, at December 31, 2015, as compared to $6.7 billion, or approximately 11.9% of our total consumer automotive loans, at December 31, 2014. Such amounts are expected to continue to increase in 2016. At December 31, 2015, $161 million of nonprime consumer automotive loans were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with our loan policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If we continue to grow our nonprime automotive financing loans over time, our credit risk will increase. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased.Our inability to maintain relationships with dealers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our business depends on the continuation of our relationships with our customers, particularly the automotive dealers with whom we do business. While the number of dealers that we have retail relationships with increased during 2015, the number of dealers that we have wholesale relationships with decreased approximately 3% as compared to December 31, 2014. Further, our share of GM and Chrysler commercial wholesale financing could decrease in the future. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with key automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason, including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis or offer products that meet the needs of the dealers or compete successfully with products of our competitors, our wholesale funding volumes, and the number of dealers with which we have retail funding relationships could decline in the future. If this occurs, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers comprise a significant portion of our customer base.While we are continuing to diversify our business, GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers continue to compose a significant portion of our customer base. In 2015, 56% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 46% of our vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for GM franchised dealers and customers, and 31% of our new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 23% of our vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for Chrysler dealers and customers. It is possible that GM or Chrysler could take actions that negatively impact the amount of business we do with GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers. Further, a significant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s business, including, for example, the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles, GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers, or vehicle recalls, could negatively impact our GM and Chrysler dealer and retail customer bases. Any future reductions in GM and Chrysler business that we are not able to offset could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans, all as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity 12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kand requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, accounting rules and related guidance, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, portfolio size, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, our continued expansion of our originations across a broad risk spectrum will likely increase our allowance for loan losses in the future.Bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. An increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.Our business and results of operations are dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our business and results of operation can be impacted by sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, credit availability, fuel costs, and overall economic conditions. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2008, and did not rebound significantly until 2012-13. Any future declines in new and used vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.A failure of or interruption in, as well as, security risks of the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely as a result of inadequate or failed processes or systems, human errors, employee misconduct, catastrophic events, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, misplaced or lost data, or other external events could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer applications being received, slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in servicing.In addition, our communication and information systems may present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft. The access by unauthorized persons to personal, confidential or proprietary information in our possession or our proprietary information, software, methodologies, and business secrets could result in a significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products, and services. For example, similar to other large financial institutions, in the past we have been subject to cyber-attacks that briefly resulted in slow performance and unavailability of our website for some customers. Information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our profitability and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if used vehicle prices decrease in the future, which could result in lower residual values of off-lease vehicles and higher losses on the sale of repossessed vehicles for retail financing.General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price, the vehicle disposition channel, and volatility of gasoline or diesel fuel, among other factors, heavily influence used vehicle prices. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during 2008, sharp declines in demand and used vehicle sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination, is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we incur additional depreciation expense and lower actual profit on the lease transaction than our priced expectation. Our expectation of levels of used vehicle values is combined with our estimate of loss frequency to arrive at our projected net average annualized loss rate (NAALR), which is a factor in determining our pricing of new originations. To the extent used vehicle prices are significantly lower than our expectations, our actual profit on new business could be significantly less than our expectations. Our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles, as well as repossessed vehicles that serve as collateral on the underlying loans, affects the disposal costs and proceeds realized from the vehicle sales.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Our liquidity and the long-term viability of Ally depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully raise capital and secure appropriate bank financing.13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it continues to remain an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2015, approximately $1.9 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2016, and approximately $4.4 billion and $3.7 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2017 and 2018, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2015, a total of $3.4 billion in principal amount of Demand Notes were outstanding. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2015, approximately $9.4 billion of outstanding consolidated secured debt is scheduled to mature in 2016, approximately $15.2 billion is scheduled to mature in 2017, and approximately $9.1 billion is scheduled to mature in 2018. Furthermore, at December 31, 2015, approximately $16.3 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2016, which is not included in the 2016 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a material portion of the debt maturities over these periods. The capital markets can be volatile, and Ally’s access to the debt markets may be significantly reduced during periods of market stress.We continue to rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions and a tightening of credit availability could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While markets have continued to stabilize following the 2008 liquidity crisis, there can be no assurances these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could materially and adversely affect our business.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2015, we had approximately $75.6 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $50.0 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 20% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2015.We have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.The market for the automotive financing industry is extremely competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully, if current competitive conditions tighten, or if there is increased competition in the automotive financing and/or insurance markets or generally in the markets for securitizations or asset sales, our business could be negatively affected.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, and banking are highly competitive. We directly compete in the automotive financing market with banks, credit unions, captive automotive finance, and independent finance companies. Conditions with respect to wholesale financing continue to be competitive. Our insurance business also faces significant competition from automotive manufacturers, captive automotive finance companies, insurance carriers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Some of these competitors have certain exclusivity privileges with automotive manufacturing companies whose customers and dealers compose a significant portion of our customer base. In addition, Ally Bank faces significant competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, substantially lower costs of capital, and are much less reliant on securitization activities, unsecured debt, and other public markets. Our competitors may be subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes than we are, thus putting us at a competitive disadvantage to these competitors. We face significant competition in most areas including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our profitability and financial condition would be negatively affected.The markets for asset securitizations and whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In addition, lenders and other investors within those markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers, originators, and asset classes, or they may require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased issuance by other participants in the market or decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure to (or to require a higher yield for) us or to automotive securitizations or whole-loans could negatively affect our ability and that of our subsidiaries to price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us.14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KGeneral business and economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased short- and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the debt capital markets, unemployment rates, housing prices, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or a decline in the strength of national and local economies and other factors that negatively affect household incomes could decrease demand for our financing products and increase financing delinquency and losses on our customer and dealer financing operations. Further, a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices could lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases and negatively affect our automotive finance business. Finally, concerns about the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere and uncertainty regarding U.S. fiscal and monetary policies and the federal deficit, have resulted in significant volatility in the financial markets, and could impact our ability to obtain, and the pricing with respect to, funding that is collateralized by affected instruments and obtained through the secured and unsecured markets. If these conditions persist or worsen, our business, results of operation, and financial position could be materially adversely affected.If the rate of inflation were to increase, or if the debt capital markets or the economy of the United States were to weaken, or if home prices or new and used vehicle purchases experience declines, we could be significantly and adversely affected, and it could become more expensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to our businesses could decrease (1) the demand for our new and used vehicle financing and (2) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of held-for-investment assets and new and used vehicle loans and retained interests that continue to be held by us, thus further increasing the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans. In addition, the rate of delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses on our loans could be higher during more severe economic slowdowns.Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses could further harm our ability to sell our new and used vehicle loans, the prices we receive for our new and used vehicle loans, or the value of our portfolio of mortgage and new and used vehicle loans held-for-investment or retained interests from our securitizations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Continued adverse business and economic conditions could affect demand for new and used vehicles, housing, the cost of construction, and other related factors that could harm the revenues and profitability of our business.Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.Geopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services; Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates our debt. Our current ratings as assigned by each of the respective rating agencies are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the unsecured market. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing costs and further constrain our access to the unsecured debt markets and, as a result, would negatively affect our business. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as impact elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements.Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Significant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or loan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive receivable, the servicer may be required by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets or other payments occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the result could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.Our earnings may decrease because of decreases or increases in interest rates.We are subject to risks from decreasing interest rates. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of our businesses by compressing net interest margins or reducing the amounts we earn on our investment securities portfolio, thereby reducing our net interest income and other revenues.Rising interest rates could also have an adverse impact on our business as well. For example, rising interest rates:•will increase our cost of funds;15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K•may reduce our consumer automotive financing volume by influencing customers to pay cash for, as opposed to financing, vehicle purchases or not to buy new vehicles;•may lead to increased consumer delinquencies;•may negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease vehicles; and•will generally reduce the value of automotive financing and mortgage loans and contracts and retained interests and fixed income securities held in our investment portfolio.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could affect our profitability and financial condition as could our failure to comply with hedge accounting principles and interpretations.We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the application of significant subjective judgments to a body of accounting concepts that is complex.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of our assets. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including, among others, retained interests from securitizations of loans and contracts, loans held-for-sale, and other investments, which do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements. For further discussion related to estimates and assumptions, see MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons, including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (for example, macro-economic conditions and their impact on our dealers), and that they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. As a result, our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. A material difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects.Fluctuations in valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues.Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation. Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value and could negatively affect our revenues. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, national and international events, and general market conditions.Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC, banking regulators, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.Recently, the FASB has proposed new financial accounting standards, and has many active projects underway, that could materially affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition. These proposed standards or projects include the potential for significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments (including loans, and allowance for loan losses) and the accounting for leases, among others. It is possible that any changes, if enacted, could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty.16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KAdverse economic conditions or changes in laws in states in which we have customer concentrations may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.We are exposed to consumer loan portfolio concentration in certain states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these and other states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockOur ability to pay dividends on our common stock or repurchase shares may be limited.Any future payment of dividends on our common stock or share repurchases will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on business conditions, our financial condition, earnings and liquidity, and other factors. Any plans to commence payment of dividends on our common stock or share repurchases in the future would be subject to the FRB’s review and non-objection. Refer to the section above titled Business — Certain Regulatory Matters — Bank Holding Company and Financial Holding Company Status for additional information. There is no assurance that, upon the FRB’s review of our future capital plans, we would be permitted to make any planned payments of dividends on our common stock or share repurchases.So long as any share of our Series A preferred stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution may be declared or paid on our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid on the Series A preferred stock. Further, any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing agreements in the future restrict our ability to pay dividends in cash on our common stock, we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on our common stock unless we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those agreements.In addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory “surplus” (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital), or if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the then current and/or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.Anti-takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. Our organizational documents include provisions:•Limiting the liability of our directors, and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and•Limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings.These provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the company or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any “interested stockholder” (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under certain circumstances including receipt of prior board approval.Any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a hostile takeover or change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KAn “ownership change” could limit our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards to offset future taxable income.As of December 31, 2015, we had deferred tax assets of approximately $950 million related to a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward, $1.7 billion related to foreign tax credits, and $193 million related to other tax credits (collectively, the tax assets). Our ability to use such tax assets to offset future taxable income and reduce future tax liabilities may be significantly limited if we experience an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of Ally’s ownership (by value) of one or more “5-percent shareholders” (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). A corporation that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on the utilization of its pre-ownership change tax assets equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax assets arising from an ownership change under Section 382 would depend, in large part, on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change.If we were to experience an “ownership change”, it is possible that our ability to fully utilize our tax assets may be delayed or deferred, and that a significant portion of our tax assets could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income or reduce future tax liabilities.On January 9, 2014, our Board adopted our Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) to help protect these tax assets. The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an “ownership change” by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder; and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of Ally common stock, subject to certain exceptions. Unless extended, the Plan expires on January 8, 2017.In addition, on January 9, 2014, our Board approved a protective amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Protective Amendment), which is designed to prevent certain transfers of Ally common stock that could result in an “ownership change.” The Protective Amendment generally restricts any transfer of Ally common stock that would (i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of Ally stock then outstanding; or (ii) increase the percentage of Ally stock owned by a Five Percent Stockholder (as defined in the Plan). Unless extended, the Protective Amendment expires on January 8, 2017.Despite the intentions of the Plan and the Protective Amendment to deter and prevent an “ownership change,” such an event may still occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of Ally common stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for Ally common stock. Accordingly, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder’s ability to realize a premium over the market price of Ally common stock in connection with any stock transaction"
16,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2015-02-27,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
Our businesses face many risks and uncertainties, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties that we face are described below. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to RegulationThe regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.We are subject to extensive laws and regulations that require significant expense and devotion of resources, which may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Ally currently operates as a FHC, which permits us to engage in certain business activities, including securities, insurance, and merchant banking activities. To maintain status as a FHC, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” as defined under applicable law. If we fail to maintain our status as a FHC, our ability to engage in the broader range of activities permitted to FHCs may be restricted and we may be required to discontinue these activities, or divest our bank subsidiary, Ally Bank.Ally is subject to ongoing supervision, examination and regulation by the FRB, and Ally Bank by the FDIC and the Utah DFI, in each case, through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify, assess, and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe-and-sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In the course of their supervision and examinations, our regulators may require improvements in various functions or areas of our business. Any requirement imposed is generally judicially enforceable, and if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal supervisory actions that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to develop any new business. Such forms of supervisory action could include, without limitation, written agreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and enforcement of such action through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to the affected product and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, or that we will not be prohibited by local laws or regulators from taking desired actions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, or results of operations.Changes to any applicable statutes, regulations, rules, or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing financial services and products. Further, noncompliance with applicable laws could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.For additional information related to our regulatory requirements, see Business — Certain Regulatory Matters.Ally and its subsidiaries are or may become involved in investigations, examinations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies, which may lead to material adverse consequences.Ally and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are or may become involved from time to time in formal and informal reviews, investigations, examinations, proceedings, and information-gathering requests by federal and state government and self-regulatory agencies, including, among others, the DOJ, SEC, CFPB, FRB, FDIC, Utah DFI, and the Federal Trade Commission regarding their respective operations.Mortgage MattersWe have received subpoenas from the DOJ that include a broad request for documentation and other information relating to residential mortgage-backed securities issued by our former mortgage subsidiary, Residential Capital, LLC and its subsidiaries (ResCap RMBS). In connection with these requests, the DOJ is investigating potential fraud and other potential legal claims related to ResCap RMBS, including its investigation of potential claims under the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989. The DOJ is also 8Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kinvestigating potential claims under the False Claims Act (FCA) related to representations made by us in connection with investments in Ally made by the United States Department of the Treasury pursuant to the Troubled Asset Relief Program in 2008 and 2009 regarding certain claims against Residential Capital, LLC or its subsidiaries at that time. We are engaged in ongoing discussions with the DOJ with respect to legal and factual aspects of their investigations. Further, at the request of the DOJ, we have entered into an agreement to voluntarily extend the statutes of limitations related to potential FCA claims.We have separately received subpoenas and document requests from the SEC that include information covering a wide range of mortgage-related matters.Automotive Subprime MattersIn October 2014 we received a document request from the SEC in connection with its investigation related to subprime automotive finance and related securitization activities. Separately, in December 2014, we received a subpoena from the DOJ requesting similar information. We are currently cooperating with both the SEC and DOJ with respect to these matters.CFPBFurther, in December 2013, Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank entered into Consent Orders issued by the CFPB and the DOJ pertaining to the allegation of disparate impact in the automotive finance business, which resulted in a $98 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Consent Orders require Ally to create a compliance plan addressing, at a minimum, the communication of Ally’s expectations of Equal Credit Opportunity Act compliance to dealers, maintenance of Ally’s existing limits on dealer finance income for contracts acquired by Ally, and monitoring for potential discrimination both at the dealer level and within our portfolio of contracts acquired across all dealers. Ally formed a compliance committee consisting of certain Ally and Ally Bank directors to oversee Ally’s execution of the Consent Orders’ terms. Ally is required to meet certain stipulations under the Consent Orders, including a requirement to make future payments should certain remediation targets not be attained.Each of the matters set forth above may result in material adverse consequences including without limitation, adverse judgments, significant settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions.Our ability to execute our business strategy may be affected by regulatory considerations.Our business strategy for Ally Bank, which is primarily focused on automotive lending and growth of our direct-channel deposit business, is subject to regulatory oversight from a safety and soundness perspective. If our banking supervisors raise concerns regarding any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank, we may be obliged to alter our strategy, which could include moving certain activities, such as certain types of lending, outside of Ally Bank to one of our nonbanking affiliates. Alternative funding sources outside of Ally Bank, such as unsecured funding in the capital markets, could be more expensive than funding through Ally Bank and could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.We are subject to capital planning and systemic risk regimes, which impose significant restrictions and requirements.As a BHC with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets, Ally is required to conduct periodic stress tests and submit a proposed capital action plan to the FRB annually. The proposed capital action plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally’s consolidated capital. The proposed capital action plan must also include a discussion of how Ally will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a Tier 1 common equity-to-total-risk-weighted assets ratio of 5 percent, and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB will either object to a proposed capital plan, in whole or in part, or provide notice of non-objection to Ally. The failure to receive a notice of non-objection from the FRB would prohibit us from paying dividends and making other capital distributions. Refer to Business — Certain Regulatory Matters for further details.In addition, in February 2014, the FRB issued a final rule to implement certain of the enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act for large bank holding companies such as Ally. The final rule generally became effective on January 1, 2015. Among other things, the final rule requires Ally to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event and implement various liquidity-related corporate governance measures and imposes certain requirements, duties and qualifications for Ally’s risk committee and chief risk officer. These enhanced prudential standards could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, the FRB has stated that it will issue, at a later date, final rules to implement certain other enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act, including single counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework. Once implemented and adopted, these rules could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.9Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our funding strategy, and we have continued to place greater reliance on deposits as a source of funding through Ally Bank. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network. It obtains its deposits through direct banking as well as brokered deposits. Brokered deposits may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher interest rates. Brokered deposits totaled $9.9 billion at December 31, 2014, which represented 17% of Ally Bank total deposits. Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected by regulatory restrictions including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements, restrictions on deposit growth, or restrictions on our rates offered. In addition, perceptions of our financial strength, rates offered by third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base. In addition, our regulators may impose restrictions on our ability to fund certain types of assets at Ally Bank, potentially raising the cost of funding those activities without the use of Ally Bank deposits. Qualitative and quantitative liquidity requirements imposed by the U.S. banking regulators may also impact our funding strategy.Financial services legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has and will continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate. Certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, and others have become effective since enactment, while others are subject to further rulemaking, transition periods, and the discretion of various regulatory bodies. The Dodd-Frank Act, when fully implemented, will have material implications for Ally and the entire financial services industry. Among other things, it will:•result in Ally being subject to enhanced oversight and scrutiny as a result of being a BHC with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (large BHC);•increase the levels of capital and liquidity with which Ally must operate and affect how it plans capital and liquidity levels;•subject Ally to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees and any other similar assessments paid by Ally Bank to the FDIC;•potentially impact a number of Ally’s business and risk management strategies;•potentially restrict the revenue that Ally generates from certain businesses;•require Ally to provide to the FRB and FDIC an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress;•subject Ally to regulation by the CFPB, which has very broad rule-making, examination, and enforcement authorities; and•subject derivatives that Ally enters into for hedging, risk management and other purposes to a comprehensive new regulatory regime which, over time, will require central clearing and execution on designated markets or execution facilities for certain standardized derivatives and impose margin, documentation, trade reporting and other new requirements.While U.S. regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, they plan to propose or finalize additional regulations for implementation in the future. In light of the further rulemaking required to fully implement the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the discretion afforded to federal regulators, the full impact of this legislation on Ally, its business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years. In addition, regulations may impact us differently in comparison to other more established financial institutions. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are likely to adversely affect Ally and its financial performance. The extent to which Ally can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not knowable at this time.Future consumer legislation or actions could harm our competitive position.In addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, various legislative bodies have also recently been considering altering the existing framework governing creditors’ rights, including legislation that would result in or allow loan modifications of various sorts. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase the cost of doing business; limit or expand permissible activities; or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on our activities, financial condition, or results of operations.10Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur business may be adversely affected upon our implementation of the revised capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III final rules.In December 2010, the Basel Committee reached an agreement on the Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. In July 2013, the U.S. banking regulators finalized rules implementing the U.S. Basel III capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Act provisions. The U.S. Basel III final rules represent substantial revisions to the previously effective regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. Ally became subject to the U.S. Basel III final rules beginning on January 1, 2015. Certain aspects of the U.S. Basel III final rules, including new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions, will be phased in over several years. The U.S. Basel III final rules subject Ally to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and a capital conservation buffer above these minimum ratios. Failure to maintain the full amount of the buffer would result in restrictions on Ally’s ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payments and stock repurchases and redemptions, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers.The U.S. Basel III final rules will, over time, require more stringent deductions for, among other assets, certain DTAs from Ally’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital and limit Ally’s ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities, or other “hybrid” securities (although certain debt or equity issued to the U.S. government under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act are grandfathered as Tier 1 capital).If we or Ally Bank fail to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, we or Ally Bank may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to informal or formal supervisory actions by the FRB and/or FDIC and, potentially, FDIC receivership of Ally Bank. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. To maintain its status as a FHC, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” as defined under applicable law.For the current capital planning and stress testing cycle that began in October 2014, the Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests and FRB supervisory stress tests to which Ally is subject, the annual capital plan that Ally must submit and the FRB’s annual post-stress capital analysis under the CCAR must incorporate the more stringent capital requirements in the U.S. Basel III final rules as they are phased in over the nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon. Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, an objection to a large BHC's capital plan would prohibit it from paying dividends or making certain other capital distributions.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by governmental fiscal and monetary policies.Our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The FRB’s policies influence the new and used vehicle financing market, which significantly affects the earnings of our businesses. The FRB’s policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the impact of affiliate transaction restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions.Certain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank “affiliates,” including but not limited to Ally Financial Inc. are subject to federal statutory and regulatory restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, “covered transactions,” including Ally Bank’s extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its nonbank affiliates, generally (1) are limited to 10% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus with respect to transactions with any individual affiliate, with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus for all affiliates and all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credit transactions, are subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a “low quality asset” under federal banking guidelines; and (4) must be conducted in accordance with safe-and-sound banking practices (collectively, the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). Furthermore, there is an “attribution rule” that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party must be treated as a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, a nonbank affiliate of Ally Bank.Under the Dodd-Frank Act, among other changes to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, credit exposures resulting from derivatives transactions, securities lending and borrowing transactions, and acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral for a loan or extension of credit will be treated as “covered transactions.” The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized and places limits on acceptable collateral.The ability to grow Ally Bank’s business in the future could be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions.11Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KAlly Financial Inc. may be limited in its ability to receive distributions from its subsidiaries.Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit the ability of Ally Financial Inc.’s subsidiaries to transfer funds freely to Ally Financial Inc. In particular, many of Ally Financial Inc.’s subsidiaries are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to it or that prohibit such transfers entirely in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations, and rules may hinder Ally Financial Inc.’s ability to access funds that it may need to make payments on its obligations in the future. Furthermore, as a BHC, Ally Financial Inc. may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on its ability to pay dividends. The bank regulators have the authority and, under certain circumstances, the duty to prohibit or to limit payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ally Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries.Risks Related to Our BusinessOur business and results of operations are highly dependent upon overall U.S. automotive industry sales volume.Our business and results of operation are highly sensitive to sales volume for new and used vehicles. Vehicle sales are impacted by several economic and market conditions, including employment levels, credit availability, fuel costs, and overall economic conditions. For example, new vehicle sales decreased dramatically during the economic crisis that began in 2008, and did not rebound significantly until 2012-13. Any future declines in new and used vehicle sales could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.The profitability and financial condition of our operations are heavily dependent upon GM and Chrysler.GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers compose a significant portion of our customer base, and our Dealer Financial Services operations are highly dependent on GM and Chrysler production and sales volume. In 2014, 61% of our U.S. new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 70% of our U.S. new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for GM franchised dealers and customers, and 28% of our U.S. new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 17% of our U.S. new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for Chrysler dealers and customers.We were previously party to separate agreements with both GM and Chrysler that provided for certain exclusivity privileges related to subvention programs that they offered. Our agreement with Chrysler expired in April 2013. In addition, our agreement with GM expired effective February 28, 2014. These agreements, which provided us with certain preferred provider benefits, including limiting the use of other financing providers by GM and Chrysler for their incentive programs, have expired.GM informed its dealers in early January 2015 that it intends to provide lease subvention programs for Buick, GMC, and Cadillac products exclusively through its wholly-owned subsidiary, General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GMF). Further, GM informed us on February 27, 2015 that they also intend to provide lease subvention programs for Chevrolet exclusively through GMF. Ally's total originations during 2014 of $41.0 billion included approximately $9.3 billion of GM lease originations and approximately $4.0 billion of GM subvented loan originations. Buick, GMC, Cadillac, and Chevrolet leases combined accounted for approximately 23% of Ally’s total originations during 2014. If we are unable to successfully offset these declines in our business, these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations over time.Other automotive manufacturers could utilize other existing companies, including their own captives, to support their financing needs including offering products or terms that we would not or could not offer, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. Furthermore, other automotive manufacturers could expand or establish or acquire captive finance companies to support their financing needs thus reducing their need for our services.A significant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s business, including the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the use of GM or Chrysler marketing incentives; GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers; vehicle recalls; or GM’s or Chrysler’s relationship with the United Auto Workers and other labor unions and other factors impacting GM or Chrysler or their respective employees, or significant adverse changes in their respective liquidity position and access to the capital markets; could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.There is no assurance that the automotive market or GM’s and Chrysler’s respective share of that market will not suffer downturns in the future, and any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.Our inability to maintain relationships with dealers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our business depends on the continuation of our relationships with our customers, particularly the automotive dealers with whom we do business. While the number of dealers that we have retail relationships with increased during 2014, the number of dealers that we have wholesale relationships with decreased approximately 2% as compared to December 31, 2013. Further, our share of GM commercial wholesale financing decreased from 71% in 2012 to 64% in 2014, and our share of Chrysler commercial wholesale financing decreased from 58% in 2012 to 45% in 2014. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with key automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason, including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis or offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, this trend related to wholesale funding may continue, and the number dealers with which we have retail funding relationships could also decline in the future. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected in the future.12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur profitability and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the residual value of off-lease vehicles decreases in the future.Vehicle operating leases currently comprise a substantial portion of our consumer financing originations. In particular, our GM lease originations were 23% of our consumer financing originations in 2014. Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination, is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we incur additional depreciation expense and/or a loss on the lease transaction. General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, new vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price, the vehicle disposition channel, and volatility of gasoline or diesel fuel, among other factors, heavily influence used vehicle prices and thus the actual residual value of off-lease vehicles. Further, it is unclear how GM's decision to provide lease subvention programs for Buick, GMC, Cadillac, and Chevrolet exclusively through GMF could impact residual values for GM vehicles. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during 2008, sharp declines in demand and used vehicle sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Vehicle brand images, consumer preference, and vehicle manufacturer marketing programs that influence new and used vehicle markets also influence lease residual values. In addition, our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and proceeds realized from the vehicle sales. Differences between the actual residual values realized on leased vehicles and our expectations of such values at contract inception could have a material negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.A failure of or interruption in, as well as, security risks of the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely as a result of inadequate or failed processes or systems, human errors, employee misconduct, catastrophic events, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, misplaced or lost data, or other external events could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer applications being received, slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in servicing.In addition, our communication and information systems may present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft. The access by unauthorized persons to personal, confidential or proprietary information in our possession or our proprietary information, software, methodologies, and business secrets could result in a significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products, and services. For example, similar to other large financial institutions, in the past we have been subject to cyber-attacks that briefly resulted in slow performance and unavailability of our website for some customers. Information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions, and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Our liquidity and the long-term viability of Ally depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully raise capital and secure appropriate bank financing.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding in recent years, it continues to remain an important component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2014, approximately $4.9 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2015, and approximately $1.9 billion and $4.4 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2016 and 2017, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2014, a total of $3.3 billion in principal amount of Demand Notes were outstanding. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2014, approximately $12.6 billion of outstanding consolidated secured debt is scheduled to mature in 2015, approximately $11.6 billion is scheduled to mature in 2016, and approximately $11.2 billion is scheduled to mature in 2017. Furthermore, at December 31, 2014, approximately $17.1 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2015, which is not included in the 2015 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a material portion of the debt maturities over these periods. The capital markets can be volatile, and Ally’s access to the debt markets may be significantly reduced during periods of market stress.As a result of volatility in the markets, our current unsecured debt ratings, and various other factors, we have increased our reliance on various secured debt markets. Although market conditions have improved, there can be no assurances that this will continue. In addition, we continue to rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions and a tightening of credit availability could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance 13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kthese facilities and increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While markets have continued to stabilize following the 2008 liquidity crisis, there can be no assurances these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could materially and adversely affect our business.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2014, we had approximately $74.6 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $47.9 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 25% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2014, we declared and paid preferred stock dividends of $268 million in the aggregate.We have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.The market for automotive financing industry is extremely competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully, if current competitive conditions tighten, or if there is increased competition in the automotive financing and/or insurance markets or generally in the markets for securitizations or asset sales, our business could be negatively affected.The markets for automotive financing, insurance, and banking are highly competitive. We directly compete in the automotive financing market with banks, credit unions, captive automotive finance, and independent finance companies. Our insurance business also faces significant competition from automotive manufacturers, captive automotive finance companies, insurance carriers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Some of these competitors have certain exclusivity privileges with automotive manufacturing companies whose customers and dealers compose a significant portion of our customer base. In addition, Ally Bank faces significant competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, and other financial institutions. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, substantially lower costs of capital, and are much less reliant on securitization activities, unsecured debt, and other public markets. Our competitors may be subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes than we are, thus putting us at a competitive disadvantage to these competitors. We face significant competition in most areas including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our profitability and financial condition would be negatively affected.The markets for asset securitizations and whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In addition, lenders and other investors within those markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers, originators, and asset classes, or they may require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased issuance by other participants in the market or decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure to (or to require a higher yield for) us or to automotive securitizations or whole-loans could negatively affect our ability and that of our subsidiaries to price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans, all as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, accounting rules and related guidance, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, portfolio size, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, our continued expansion of our originations across a broad risk spectrum could increase our allowance for loan losses in the future.Bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. An increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe are exposed to consumer credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. Furthermore, a weak economic environment and high unemployment rates could exert pressure on our consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions, and losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies, and loss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent a further adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. We have continued to provide nonprime automotive financing. We define nonprime consumer automotive loans primarily as those loans with a FICO score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. In addition, we have increased our used vehicle financing. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. At December 31, 2014, the carrying value of our Automotive Finance operations nonprime consumer automotive loans before allowance for loan losses was $6.7 billion, or approximately 11.9% of our total consumer automotive loans. Of these loans, $118 million were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with internal loan policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. If we continue to grow our nonprime automotive financing loans over time, our credit risk may increase. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased.General business and economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased short- and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the debt capital markets, unemployment rates, housing prices, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or a decline in the strength of national and local economies and other factors that negatively affect household incomes could decrease demand for our financing products and increase financing delinquency and losses on our customer and dealer financing operations. Further, a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices could lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases and negatively affect our automotive finance business. Finally, concerns about the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere and uncertainty regarding U.S. fiscal and monetary policies and the federal deficit, have resulted in significant volatility in the financial markets, and could impact our ability to obtain, and the pricing with respect to, funding that is collateralized by affected instruments and obtained through the secured and unsecured markets. As these conditions persist, our business, results of operation, and financial position could be materially adversely affected.If the rate of inflation were to increase, or if the debt capital markets or the economy of the United States were to weaken, or if home prices or new and used vehicle purchases experience declines, we could be significantly and adversely affected, and it could become more expensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to our businesses could decrease (1) the demand for our new and used vehicle financing and (2) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of held-for-investment assets and new and used vehicle loans and retained interests that continue to be held by us, thus further increasing the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans. In addition, the rate of delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses on our loans could be higher during more severe economic slowdowns.Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses could further harm our ability to sell our new and used vehicle loans, the prices we receive for our new and used vehicle loans, or the value of our portfolio of mortgage and new and used vehicle loans held-for-investment or retained interests from our securitizations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Continued adverse business and economic conditions could affect demand for new and used vehicles, housing, the cost of construction, and other related factors that could harm the revenues and profitability of our business.Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.Geopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services; Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates our debt. Our current ratings as assigned by each of the respective rating agencies are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the unsecured market. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing costs and further constrain our access to the unsecured debt markets and, as a result, would negatively affect our business. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as impact elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements.Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KSignificant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or loan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive receivable, the servicer may be required by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets or other payments occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the result could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.Our earnings may decrease because of decreases or increases in interest rates.We are subject to risks from decreasing interest rates. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of our businesses by compressing net interest margins or reducing the amounts we earn on our investment securities portfolio, thereby reducing our net interest income and other revenues.Rising interest rates could also have an adverse impact on our business as well. For example, rising interest rates:•will increase our cost of funds;•may reduce our consumer automotive financing volume by influencing customers to pay cash for, as opposed to financing, vehicle purchases or not to buy new vehicles;•may lead to increased consumer delinquencies;•may negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease vehicles; and•will generally reduce the value of automotive financing loans and contracts and retained interests and fixed income securities held in our investment portfolio.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could affect our profitability and financial condition as could our failure to comply with hedge accounting principles and interpretations.We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the application of significant subjective judgments to a body of accounting concepts that is complex.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of our assets. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including, among others, retained interests from securitizations of loans and contracts, loans held-for-sale, and other investments, which do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses, and loss adjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements. For further discussion related to estimates and assumptions, see MD&A — Critical Accounting Estimates. Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons, including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (for example, macro-economic conditions and their impact on our dealers), and that they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. As a result, our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. A material difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects.Fluctuations in valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues.Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation. Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value and could negatively affect our revenues. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, national and international events, and general market conditions.16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KChanges in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC, banking regulators, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.Recently, the FASB has proposed new financial accounting standards, and has many active projects underway, that could materially affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition. These proposed standards or projects include the potential for significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments (including loans, and allowance for loan losses) and the accounting for leases, among others. It is possible that any changes, if enacted, could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in states in which we have customer concentrations may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.We are exposed to consumer loan portfolio concentration in certain states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these and other states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.Risks Related to Ownership of Our Common StockWe have no current plans to pay dividends on our common stock, and our ability to pay dividends on our common stock may be limited.We have no current plans to commence payment of a dividend on our common stock. Our payment of dividends on our common stock in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors in its sole discretion and will depend on business conditions, our financial condition, earnings and liquidity, and other factors. Our Series G preferred stock allows dividend payments on our common stock only if 1) our senior guaranteed notes issued on December 31, 2008 are rated investment grade and 2) the payment, together with other dividend payments we made since December 31, 2008, is less than 25% of our cumulative consolidated net income from January 1, 2014 to the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which financial statements are available at the time of such dividend payment. In addition, so long as any share of our Series A preferred stock remains outstanding, no dividend or distribution may be declared or paid on our common stock unless all accrued and unpaid dividends have been paid on the Series A preferred stock.Any indentures and other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock, including our common stock. In the event that any of our indentures or other financing agreements in the future restrict our ability to pay dividends in cash on our common stock, we may be unable to pay dividends in cash on our common stock unless we can refinance the amounts outstanding under those agreements.In addition, under Delaware law, our Board of Directors may declare dividends on our capital stock only to the extent of our statutory “surplus” (which is defined as the amount equal to total assets minus total liabilities, in each case at fair market value, minus statutory capital), or if there is no such surplus, out of our net profits for the then current and/or immediately preceding fiscal year. Further, even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Delaware law to pay cash dividends on our common stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends in cash on our common stock.Any plans to commence payment of dividends on our common stock in the future would be subject to the FRB’s review and non-objection. Refer to Business — Certain Regulatory Matters — Bank Holding Company and Financial Holding Company Status for additional information. There is no assurance that, upon the FRB’s review of our future capital plans, we would be permitted to make any planned payments of dividends on our common stock.Anti-takeover provisions contained in our organizational documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a takeover attempt or change in control of our company, which could adversely affect the price of our common stock.Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, our amended and restated bylaws, and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board of Directors. Our organizational documents include provisions:•Limiting the liability of our directors, and providing indemnification to our directors and officers; and•Limiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings.17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the company or changes in management.In addition, we are subject to Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which generally prohibits a corporation from engaging in various business combination transactions with any “interested stockholder” (generally defined as a stockholder who owns 15% or more of a corporation’s voting stock) for a period of three years following the time that such stockholder became an interested stockholder, except under certain circumstances including receipt of prior board approval.Any provision of our Certificate of Incorporation or our Bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a hostile takeover or change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.An “ownership change” could limit our ability to utilize tax losses and credits carryforwards to offset future taxable income.As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred tax assets of approximately $1.0 billion related to a U.S. federal net operating loss carryforward, $157 million related to capital loss carryforwards, $1.7 billion related to foreign tax credits, and $170 million related to other tax credits (collectively, the tax assets). Our ability to use such tax assets to offset future taxable income and reduce future tax liabilities may be significantly limited if we experience an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of Ally’s ownership (by value) of one or more “5-percent shareholders” (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). A corporation that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on the utilization of its pre-ownership change tax assets equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The annual limitation would be increased each year to the extent that there is an unused limitation in a prior year. The limitation on our ability to utilize tax assets arising from an ownership change under Section 382 would depend, in large part, on the value of our equity at the time of any ownership change.If we were to experience an “ownership change”, it is possible that our ability to fully utilize our tax assets may be delayed or deferred, and that a significant portion of our tax assets could expire before we would be able to use them to offset future taxable income or reduce future tax liabilities.On January 9, 2014, our Board adopted our Tax Asset Protection Plan (the Plan) to help protect these tax assets. The Plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an “ownership change” by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.99 percent shareholder; and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.99 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of Ally common stock, subject to certain exceptions. Unless extended, the Plan expires on January 8, 2017.In addition, on January 9, 2014, our Board approved a protective amendment to our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (Protective Amendment), which is designed to prevent certain transfers of Ally common stock that could result in an “ownership change.” The Protective Amendment generally restricts any transfer of Ally common stock that would (i) increase the ownership by any person to 4.99 percent or more of Ally stock then outstanding; or (ii) increase the percentage of Ally stock owned by a Five Percent Stockholder (as defined in the Plan). Unless extended, the Protective Amendment expires on January 8, 2017.Despite the intentions of the Plan and the Protective Amendment to deter and prevent an “ownership change”, such an event may still occur. In addition, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire us, and may discourage open market purchases of Ally common stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for Ally common stock. Accordingly, the Plan and the Protective Amendment may limit a shareholder’s ability to realize a premium over the market price of Ally common stock in connection with any stock transaction"
9,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2014-03-03,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
Our businesses face many risks and uncertainties, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties that we face are described below. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to RegulationOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by regulations to which we are subject as a result of our bank holding company and financial holding company status. We are a bank holding company and a financial holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). Many of the regulatory requirements to which we are subject as a bank holding company were not applicable to us prior to December 2008 and have and will continue to require significant expense and devotion of resources to fully implement necessary policies and procedures to ensure continued compliance. Compliance with such regulations involves substantial costs and may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. The 2008 financial crisis has resulted in bank regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on participants in the financial services industry, including us. For a description of our regulatory requirements, see “Business — Certain Regulatory Matters.”Ally is subject to ongoing supervision, examination and regulation by the FRB, and Ally Bank by the FDIC and the Utah DFI, in each case, through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify, assess, and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe-and-sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. In the course of their supervision and examinations, our regulators may require improvements in various areas. Such areas could include, among others: board and senior management oversight, risk management, regulatory reporting, internal audit planning, capital adequacy process, stress testing, Bank Secrecy Act / anti-money laundering compliance, compliance management and training, compliance monitoring, and consumer complaint resolution. Ally is currently required by its regulators to make improvements related to its fair lending monitoring practices. Any requirement imposed is generally judicially enforceable, and if we are unable to implement and maintain any required actions in a timely and effective manner, we could become subject to formal supervisory actions that could lead to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to develop any new business. Such forms of supervisory action could include, without limitation, written agreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and enforcement of such action through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.As a financial holding company, we are permitted to engage in a broader range of financial and related activities than those that are permissible for bank holding companies, in particular, securities, insurance, and merchant banking activities. Ally's status as a financial holding company allows us to continue all existing insurance activities, as well as our SmartAuction vehicle remarketing services for third parties. Notwithstanding our status as a financial holding company, certain activities may require prior approval of the relevant banking supervisors. There can be no assurance that such prior approval will be obtained. To maintain its status as a financial holding company, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed,” as defined under applicable law. If we fail to maintain our status as a financial holding company, our ability to engage in the broader range of activities permitted to financial holding companies may be restricted and we may be required to discontinue these activities or divest our bank subsidiary, Ally Bank.Our ability to execute our business strategy may be affected by regulatory considerations.Our business strategy for Ally Bank, which is primarily focused on automotive lending and growth of our direct-channel deposit business, is subject to regulatory oversight from a safety and soundness perspective. If our banking supervisors raise concerns regarding any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank, we may be obliged to alter our strategy, which could include moving certain activities, such as certain types of lending, outside of Ally Bank to one of our nonbanking affiliates. Alternative funding sources outside of Ally Bank, such as unsecured funding in the capital markets, could be more expensive than funding through Ally Bank and could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Further, our regulators require Ally Bank to maintain capital levels in excess of what management believes is needed, which affects Ally Bank’s ability to optimally deploy capital and execute certain business initiatives, and we will need to obtain regulatory approvals in order to maintain lower capital levels.We are subject to capital planning and systemic risk regimes, which impose significant restrictions and requirements.As a bank holding company with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets, Ally is required to conduct periodic stress tests and submit a proposed capital action plan to the FRB every January, which the FRB must take action on by the following March. The proposed capital action plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally’s consolidated capital. The proposed capital action plan must also include a discussion of how Ally will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a Tier 1 common equity-to-total risk-weighted assets ratio of 5 percent, and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB's capital plan rule requires that Ally receive no objection from the FRB prior to making a capital distribution. The failure to receive no objection from the FRB would prohibit us from paying dividends and making other capital distributions. See ""Business — Certain Regulatory Matters"" for further details.11Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KIn addition, in February 2014, the FRB issued a final rule to implement certain of the enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) for large bank holding companies with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets, such as Ally. The final rule will, among other things, require Ally to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event and implement various liquidity-related corporate governance measures; and impose certain requirements, duties, and qualifications for Ally's Risk Management Committee and Chief Risk Officer. The final rule will have a general compliance date of January 1, 2015. The enhanced prudential standards, when effective, could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, the FRB has stated that it will issue, at a later date, final rules to implement certain other enhanced prudential standards mandated by Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank act, including single counterparty credit limits and an early remediation framework. Once implemented and adopted, these rules could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our funding strategy, and we have continued to place greater reliance on deposits as a source of funding through Ally Bank. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network, and it obtains its deposits through direct banking and brokered deposits which, at December 31, 2013, included $8.2 billion of brokered certificates of deposit that may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher interest rates. At December 31, 2013, brokered deposits represented 18% of Ally Bank total deposits. Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected by regulatory restrictions including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements, restrictions on deposit growth, or restrictions on our rates offered. In addition, perceptions of our financial strength, rates offered by third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact the size of our deposit base. In addition, our regulators may impose restrictions on our ability to fund certain types of assets at Ally Bank, potentially raising the cost of funding those activities without the use of Ally Bank deposits. Qualitative and quantitative liquidity requirements that are being proposed and finalized by the U.S. banking regulators may also impact our funding strategy.The regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.Our domestic operations are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions relating to supervision and regulation by state and federal authorities. Such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers, not for the benefit of investors in our securities, and could limit our discretion in operating our business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.Ally, Ally Bank, and many of our nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank and other regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. This regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors, the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Changes to statutes, regulations, rules, or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing financial services and products.Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to the affected product and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, or that we will not be prohibited by local laws or regulators from raising interest rates above certain desired levels, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, or results of operations.Financial services legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has and will continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate. Certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, and others have become effective since enactment, while others are subject to further rulemaking and discretion of various regulatory bodies. The Dodd-Frank Act, when fully implemented, will have material implications for Ally and the entire financial services industry. Among other things, it would:•result in Ally being subject to enhanced oversight and scrutiny as a result of being a bank holding company with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets (large bank holding company);•increase the levels of capital and liquidity with which Ally must operate and affect how it plans capital and liquidity levels;•subject Ally to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees and any other similar assessments paid by Ally Bank to the FDIC;•potentially impact a number of Ally's business and risk management strategies;•potentially restrict the revenue that Ally generates from certain businesses;12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K•require Ally to provide to the FRB and FDIC an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress; •subject Ally to regulation by the CFPB, which has very broad rule-making, examination, and enforcement authorities; and•subject derivatives that Ally enters into for hedging, risk management and other purposes to a comprehensive new regulatory regime which, over time, will require central clearing and execution on designated markets or execution facilities for certain standardized derivatives and impose margin, documentation, trade reporting and other new requirements.While U.S. regulators have finalized many regulations to implement various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, they plan to propose or finalize additional regulations for implementation in the future. In light of the further rulemaking required to fully implement the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the discretion afforded to federal regulators, the full impact of this legislation on Ally, its business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years. In addition, regulations may impact us differently in comparison to other more established financial institutions. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are likely to adversely affect Ally and its financial performance. The extent to which Ally can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not knowable at this time.Our business may be adversely affected upon our implementation of the revised capital requirements under the U.S. Basel III final rules.In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (Basel Committee) reached an agreement on the Basel III capital framework, which was designed to increase the quality and quantity of regulatory capital by introducing new risk-based and leverage capital standards. The U.S. banking regulators have finalized rules implementing the Basel III capital framework and related Dodd-Frank Act provisions. The U.S. Basel III final rules represent substantial revisions to the existing regulatory capital standards for U.S. banking organizations. Ally will become subject to the U.S. Basel III final rules beginning on January 1, 2015. Certain aspects of the U.S. Basel III final rules, including the new capital buffers and regulatory capital deductions, will be phased in over several years. The U.S. Basel III final rules will subject Ally to higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and capital buffers above these minimum requirements. Failure to maintain such buffers will result in restrictions on Ally’s ability to make capital distributions, including dividend payment, stock repurchases and redemptions, and pay discretionary bonuses to executive officers. The U.S. Basel III final rules will, over time, require more stringent deductions for, among other assets, certain deferred tax assets (DTAs) from Ally’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital and limit Ally’s ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through the use of trust preferred securities, or other “hybrid” securities (although certain debt or equity issued to the U.S. government under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act are grandfathered as Tier 1 capital). If we or Ally Bank fail to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, we or Ally Bank may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to informal or formal supervisory actions by the FRB and/or FDIC and, potentially, FDIC receivership of Ally Bank. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. Effective January 1, 2015, the “well-capitalized” standard for Ally Bank will be revised to reflect the higher capital requirements in the U.S. Basel III final rules. To maintain its status as a financial holding company, Ally and its bank subsidiary, Ally Bank, must remain “well-capitalized” and “well-managed”, as defined under applicable law.Commencing with the current capital planning and stress testing cycle that began in October 2013, the Dodd-Frank company-run stress tests and FRB supervisory stress tests to which Ally is subject, the annual capital plan that Ally must submit and the FRB’s annual post-stress capital analysis under the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review (CCAR) must incorporate the more stringent capital requirements in the U.S. Basel III final rules as they are phased in over the nine-quarter forward-looking planning horizon. Under the FRB’s capital plan rule, an objection to a large bank holding company’s capital plan would prohibit it from paying dividends or making certain other capital distributions.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by governmental fiscal and monetary policies.Our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The FRB’s policies influence the new and used vehicle financing market, which significantly affects the earnings of our businesses. The FRB’s policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Future consumer legislation or actions could harm our competitive position.In addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, various legislative bodies have also recently been considering altering the existing framework governing creditors’ rights, including legislation that would result in or allow loan modifications of various sorts. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business; limit or expand permissible activities; or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on our activities, financial condition, or results of operations.13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KAlly and its subsidiaries are involved in investigations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies, which may lead to material adverse consequences.Ally and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are or may become involved from time to time in reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal), and information-gathering requests, by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the FRB, FDIC, Utah DFI, CFPB, DOJ, SEC, and the Federal Trade Commission regarding their respective operations. Such requests include subpoenas from each of the SEC and the DOJ. The subpoenas and document requests from the SEC include information covering a wide range of mortgage-related matters, and the subpoenas received from the DOJ include a broad request for documentation and other information in connection with its investigations of potential fraud and other potential legal violations related to mortgage-backed securities, as well as the origination and/or underwriting of mortgage loans. Further, in December 2013, Ally Financial Inc. and Ally Bank entered into Consent Orders issued by the CFPB and the DOJ pertaining to the allegation of disparate impact in the automotive finance business, which resulted in a $98 million charge in the fourth quarter of 2013. The Consent Orders require Ally to create a compliance plan addressing, at a minimum, the communication of Ally’s expectations of Equal Credit Opportunity Act compliance to dealers, maintenance of Ally’s existing limits on dealer finance income for contracts acquired by Ally, and monitoring for potential discrimination both at the dealer level and across all dealers. Ally also must form a compliance committee consisting of Ally and Ally Bank directors to oversee Ally’s execution of the Consent Orders’ terms. Failure to achieve certain remediation targets could result in the payment of additional amounts in the future. Investigations, proceedings or information-gathering requests that Ally is, or may become, involved in may result in material adverse consequences including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions. Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the impact of affiliate transaction restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions.Certain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank “affiliates,” including but not limited to Ally Financial Inc. are subject to federal statutory and regulatory restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, “covered transactions,” including Ally Bank’s extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its nonbank affiliates, generally (1) are limited to 10% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus with respect to transactions with any individual affiliate, with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus for all affiliates and all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credit transactions, are subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a “low quality asset” under federal banking guidelines; and (4) must be conducted in accordance with safe-and-sound banking practices (collectively, the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). Furthermore, there is an “attribution rule” that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party must be treated as a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, a nonbank affiliate of Ally Bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, among other changes to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, credit exposures resulting from derivatives transactions, securities lending and borrowing transactions, and acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral for a loan or extension of credit will be treated as ""covered transactions."" The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized and places limits on acceptable collateral.The ability to grow Ally Bank’s business in the future could be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions.Ally Financial Inc. may require distributions in the future from its subsidiaries.We currently fund Ally Financial Inc.’s obligations, including dividend payments to our preferred shareholders, and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness, from cash generated by Ally Financial Inc. In the future, Ally Financial Inc. may not generate sufficient funds at the parent company level to fund its obligations. As such, it may require dividends, distributions, or other payments from its subsidiaries to fund its obligations. However, regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit the ability of Ally Financial Inc.’s subsidiaries to transfer funds freely to Ally Financial Inc. In particular, many of Ally Financial Inc.’s subsidiaries are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to it or that prohibit such transfers entirely in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations, and rules may hinder Ally Financial Inc.’s ability to access funds that it may need to make payments on its obligations in the future. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, Ally Financial Inc. may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on its ability to pay dividends. The bank regulators have the authority and, under certain circumstances, the duty to prohibit or to limit payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ally Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe profitability and financial condition of our operations are heavily dependent upon the performance, operations, and prospects of the overall U.S. automotive market, and also upon GM and Chrysler.GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers compose a significant portion of our customer base, and our Dealer Financial Services operations are highly dependent on GM and Chrysler production and sales volume. In 2013, 62% of our U.S. new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 69% of our U.S. new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for GM franchised dealers and customers, and 27% of our U.S. new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 22% of our U.S. new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for Chrysler dealers and customers.14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOn October 1, 2010, GM acquired AmeriCredit Corp. (which GM subsequently renamed General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GMF)), an independent automotive finance company. Further, during 2013 we completed the sale of our automotive finance operations in Europe and Latin America to GMF and expect to complete the sale of our interest in the joint venture in China to GMF in the next twelve months. As GMF continues to grow and offer new products, and as GM directs additional business to GMF, it could reduce GM's reliance on our services over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. In addition, GMF has begun to offer certain insurance products that we also offer. In addition, GM or other automotive manufacturers could utilize other existing companies to support their financing needs including offering products or terms that we would not or could not offer, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. Furthermore, other automotive manufacturers could expand or establish or acquire captive finance companies to support their financing needs thus reducing their need for our services.A significant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s business, including the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the use of GM or Chrysler marketing incentives; GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers; or GM’s or Chrysler’s relationship with the United Auto Workers and other labor unions and other factors impacting GM or Chrysler or their respective employees, or significant adverse changes in their respective liquidity position and access to the capital markets; could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.There is no assurance that the automotive market or GM’s and Chrysler’s respective share of that market will not suffer downturns in the future, and any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.Our agreements with GM and Chrysler that provided for certain exclusivity privileges have expired. The expiration of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.We were previously party to agreements with each of GM and Chrysler that provided for certain exclusivity privileges related to subvention programs that they offered. On April 25, 2012, Chrysler provided us with notification of nonrenewal for our existing agreement with them, and as a result, our agreement with Chrysler expired in April 2013. Further, in May 2013 Chrysler announced that it has entered into a ten-year agreement with Santander Consumer USA Inc. (Santander), pursuant to which Santander will provide a full range of wholesale and retail financing services to Chrysler dealers and consumers. Since this time, our originations of Chrysler subvented retail financing and subvented leases have ceased and resulted in a reduction of originations from the Chrysler channel. In addition, our agreement with GM expired effective February 28, 2014. These agreements provided Ally with certain preferred provider benefits, including limiting the use of other financing providers by GM and Chrysler for their incentive programs. While we have entered into a new agreement with GM relating to certain matters, such agreement does not provide Ally with any exclusivity or similar privileges related to the financing of GM vehicles, whether through subvention programs or otherwise. As a result, our existing agreement with GM does not provide the economic benefits or impose the obligations that were included within our prior agreement with GM. We cannot predict the ultimate impact that the expiration of prior agreements or the terms of the new GM Agreement will have on our operations. However, the expiration of these agreements and the terms of the new GM agreement are likely to continue to increase competitive pressure on Ally. Our share of financing for GM consumer sales decreased from 38% in 2011 to 29% in 2013, and our share of financing for Chrysler consumer sales decreased from 32% in 2011 to 14% in 2013. Our inability to maintain relationships with dealers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our business depends on the continuation of our relationships with our customers, particularly the automotive dealers with whom we do business. While the number of dealers that we have retail relationships with has held relatively flat during 2013, the number of dealers that we have wholesale relationships with has decreased approximately 10% as compared to December 31, 2012. Further, our share of GM commercial wholesale financing decreased from 78% in 2011 to 67% in 2013, and our share of Chrysler commercial wholesale financing decreased from 67% in 2011 to 50% in 2013. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with key automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason, including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis or offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, this trend related to wholesale funding may continue, and the number dealers with which we have retail funding relationships could also decline in the future. As a result, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected in the future.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Our liquidity and the long-term viability of Ally depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully raise capital and secure appropriate bank financing. We are currently required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 15% at Ally Bank, which will require that Ally maintain substantial capital levels in Ally Bank.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding, it continues to remain a critical component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2013, approximately $5.5 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2014, and approximately $5.2 billion and $1.9 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2013, a total of $3.2 billion in principal amount of Demand Notes were outstanding. We also rely substantially on secured funding. At December 31, 2013, approximately $11.9 billion of outstanding consolidated secured debt is scheduled to mature in 2014, approximately 15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K$13.8 billion is scheduled to mature in 2015, and approximately $7.9 billion is scheduled to mature in 2016. Furthermore, at December 31, 2013, approximately $15.5 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2014, which is not included in the 2014 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a material portion of the debt maturities over these periods. The capital markets can be volatile, and Ally’s access to the debt markets may be significantly reduced during periods of market stress. As a result of volatility in the markets and our current unsecured debt ratings, we have increased our reliance on various secured debt markets. Although market conditions have improved, there can be no assurances that this will continue. In addition, we continue to rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions and a tightening of credit availability could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While markets have continued to stabilize following the 2008 liquidity crisis, there can be no assurances these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could materially and adversely affect our business.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2013, we had approximately $79.2 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $47.6 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 33% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2013, we declared and paid preferred stock dividends of $810 million in the aggregate.We have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.The financial services industry is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully or if there is increased competition in the automotive financing and/or insurance markets or generally in the markets for securitizations or asset sales, our business could be negatively affected.The markets for automotive financing, banking, and insurance are highly competitive. The market for automotive financing has grown substantially more competitive as more consumers are financing their vehicle purchases and as more competitors continue to enter this market as a result of how well automotive finance assets generally performed relative to other asset classes during the 2008 economic downturn. Competition for automotive financing has further intensified as a growing number of banks have become increasingly interested in automotive-finance assets, which has resulted in pressure on our net interest margins. For example, on April 1, 2011, TD Bank Group announced the closing of its acquisition of Chrysler Financial, which could enhance Chrysler Financial’s ability to expand its product offerings and may result in increased competition. Ally Bank faces significant competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage companies, and other financial institutions. Our insurance business faces significant competition from insurance carriers, reinsurers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, substantially lower costs of capital, and are much less reliant on securitization activities, unsecured debt, and other public markets. Our competitors may be subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes than we are, thus putting us at a competitive disadvantage to these competitors. We face significant competition in most areas including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our profitability and financial condition would be negatively affected.The markets for asset securitizations and whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In addition, lenders and other investors within those markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers, originators, and asset classes, or they may require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased issuance by other participants in the market or decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure to (or to require a higher yield for) us or to automotive securitizations or whole-loans could negatively affect our ability and that of our subsidiaries to price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans, all as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, accounting rules and related guidance, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses. In addition, our continued expansion of our originations across a broader credit spectrum is expected to increase our allowance for loan losses in the future.16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KBank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. An increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.We are exposed to consumer credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. Furthermore, a weak economic environment and high unemployment rates could exert pressure on our consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions, and losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies, and loss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent a further adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. We have continued to expand our nonprime automobile financing. We define nonprime consumer automobile loans primarily as those loans with a FICO score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. In addition, we have increased our used vehicle financing. Customers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO scores as compared to new vehicle customers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. At December 31, 2013, the carrying value of our Automotive Finance operations nonprime consumer automobile loans before allowance for loan losses was $6.0 billion, or approximately 10.7% of our total consumer automobile loans. Of these loans, $91 million were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with internal loan policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As we continue to grow our nonprime automobile financing loans over time, our credit risk may increase. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased.Our profitability and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the residual value of off-lease vehicles decrease in the future.Lease originations are increasingly a substantial portion of our consumer financing originations. In particular, our GM lease originations grew to 23% in 2013 of our consumer financing originations from 13% in 2011. Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination, is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we incur additional depreciation expense and/or a loss on the lease transaction. General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, new vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price and volatility of gasoline or diesel fuel, among other factors, heavily influence used vehicle prices and thus the actual residual value of off-lease vehicles. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during 2008, sharp declines in demand and used vehicle sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Vehicle brand images, consumer preference, and vehicle manufacturer marketing programs that influence new and used vehicle markets also influence lease residual values. In addition, our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and proceeds realized from the vehicle sales. While manufacturers, at times, may provide support for lease residual values including through residual support programs, this support does not in all cases entitle us to full reimbursement for the difference between the remarketing sales proceeds for off-lease vehicles and the residual value specified in the lease contract. Differences between the actual residual values realized on leased vehicles and our expectations of such values at contract inception could have a material negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.General business and economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased short- and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the debt capital markets, unemployment rates, housing prices, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or a decline in the strength of national and local economies and other factors that negatively affect household incomes could decrease demand for our financing products and increase financing delinquency and losses on our customer and dealer financing operations. Further, a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices could lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases and negatively affect our automotive finance business. Finally, concerns about the pace of economic growth in the U.S. and elsewhere and uncertainty regarding U.S. fiscal and monetary policies and the federal deficit, have resulted in significant volatility in the financial markets, and could impact our ability to obtain, and the pricing with respect to, funding that is collateralized by affected instruments and obtained through the secured and unsecured markets. As these conditions persist, our business, results of operation, and financial position could be materially adversely affected. If the rate of inflation were to increase, or if the debt capital markets or the economy of the United States were to weaken, or if home prices or new and used vehicle purchases experience declines, we could be significantly and adversely affected, and it could become more expensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to our businesses could decrease (1) the demand for our new and used vehicle financing and (2) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of held-for-investment assets and new and used vehicle loans and interests that continue to be 17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kheld by us, thus further increasing the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans. In addition, the rate of delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses on our loans could be higher during more severe economic slowdowns.Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses could further harm our ability to sell our new and used vehicle loans, the prices we receive for our new and used vehicle loans, or the value of our portfolio of mortgage and new and used vehicle loans held-for-investment or interests from our securitizations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Continued adverse business and economic conditions could affect demand for new and used vehicles, housing, the cost of construction, and other related factors that could harm the revenues and profitability of our business.Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.Geopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.The U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) holds a significant amount of our outstanding common stock.At February 28, 2014, Treasury held 571,971 shares of common stock, which represents approximately 37% of the voting power of the holders of common stock outstanding for matters requiring a vote of the holders of common stock.Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement dated August 19, 2013, as of the date hereof, Treasury also has the right to appoint four of the eleven members to our board of directors. As a result of this stock ownership interest and Treasury's right to appoint four directors to our board of directors, Treasury has the ability to exert control, through its power to vote for the election of our directors, over various matters. To the extent Treasury elects to exert such control over us, its interests (as a government entity) may differ from those of our other stockholders and it may influence, through its ability to vote for the election of our directors, matters including:•the selection, tenure and compensation of our management; •our business strategy and product offerings; •our relationship with our employees and other constituencies; and•our financing activities, including the issuance of debt and equity securities. In the future we may also become subject to new and additional laws and government regulations regarding various aspects of our business as a result of participation in the TARP program and the U.S. government's ownership in our business. These regulations could make it more difficult for us to compete with other companies that are not subject to similar regulations.The limitations on compensation imposed on us due to our participation in TARP, including the restrictions placed on our compensation by the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, may adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate our executives and employees.Our performance is largely dependent on the talent and efforts of our management team and employees. As a result of our participation in TARP, the compensation of certain members of our management team and employees is subject to extensive restrictions under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the ARRA), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, as implemented by the Interim Final Rule issued by Treasury on June 15, 2009 (the IFR). In addition, due to our participation in TARP, pursuant to ARRA and the IFR, the Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation has the authority to further regulate our compensation arrangements with certain of our executives and employees. In addition, we may become subject to further restrictions under any other future legislation or regulation limiting executive compensation. Many of the restrictions are not limited to our senior executives and affect other employees whose contributions to revenue and performance may be significant. These limitations may leave us unable to create a compensation structure that permits us to retain and motivate certain of our executives and employees or to attract new executives or employees, especially if we are competing against institutions that are not subject to the same restrictions. Any such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services; Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates our debt. Our current ratings as assigned by each of the respective rating agencies are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the unsecured market. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing costs and further constrain our access to the unsecured debt markets and, as a result, would negatively affect our business. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as impact elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements.18Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KAgency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Significant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or loan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive receivable, the servicer may be required by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets or other payments occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the result could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.Our earnings may decrease because of decreases or increases in interest rates.We are subject to risks from decreasing interest rates. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of our businesses by compressing net interest margins or reducing the amounts we earn on our investment securities portfolio, thereby reducing our net interest income and other revenues.Rising interest rates could also have an adverse impact on our business as well. For example, rising interest rates:•will increase our cost of funds;•may reduce our consumer automotive financing volume by influencing customers to pay cash for, as opposed to financing, vehicle purchases or not to buy new vehicles;•may negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease vehicles; and•will generally reduce the value of automotive financing loans and contracts and retained interests and fixed income securities held in our investment portfolio.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could affect our profitability and financial condition as could our failure to comply with hedge accounting principles and interpretations.We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the application of significant subjective judgments to a body of accounting concepts that is complex.A failure of or interruption in, as well as, security risks of the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely as a result of inadequate or failed processes or systems, human errors, employee misconduct, catastrophic events, external or internal security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, malware, misplaced or lost data, or other external events could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer applications being received, slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in servicing. In addition, our communication and information systems may present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft. The access by unauthorized persons to personal, confidential or proprietary information in our possession or our proprietary information, software, methodologies and business secrets could result in a significant legal and financial exposure, supervisory liability, damage to our reputation or a loss of confidence in the security of our systems, products, and services. For example, similar to other large financial institutions, in the past we have been subject to cyber attacks that briefly resulted in slow performance and unavailability of our website for some customers. Information security risks for large financial institutions like us have increased recently in part because of new technologies, the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies (including mobile devices) to conduct financial and other business transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime, perpetrators of fraud, hackers, terrorists, and others. We may not be able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types, especially because the techniques used change frequently and because attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business. 19Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of our assets. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including certain held-for-sale loans for which we elected fair value accounting, retained interests from securitizations of loans and contracts, and other investments, which do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements. For further discussion related to estimates and assumptions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates.” Our assumptions and estimates may be inaccurate for many reasons, including that they often involve matters that are inherently difficult to predict and that are beyond our control (for example, macro economic conditions and their impact on our dealers), and that they often involve complex interactions between a number of dependent and independent variables, factors, and other assumptions. As a result, our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. A material difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects.Fluctuations in valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues.Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation. Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value and could negatively affect our revenues. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, national and international events, and general market conditions.Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC, banking regulators, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.Recently, the FASB has proposed new financial accounting standards, and has many active projects underway, that could materially affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition. These proposed standards or projects include the potential for significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments (including loans, deposits, allowance for loan losses, and debt) and the accounting for leases, among others. It is possible that any changes, if enacted, could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in states in which we have customer concentrations may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.We are exposed to consumer loan portfolio concentration in certain states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these and other states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position"
11,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2013-03-01,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
Our businesses face many risks and uncertainties, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties that we face are described below. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.10Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KRisks Related to RegulationOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by regulations to which we are subject as a result of our bank holding company status. We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). Many of the regulatory requirements to which we are subject as a bank holding company were not applicable to us prior to December 2008 and have and will continue to require significant expense and devotion of resources to fully implement necessary policies and procedures to ensure continued compliance. Compliance with such laws and regulations involves substantial costs and may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Recent events, particularly in the financial and real estate markets, have resulted in bank regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on participants in the financial services industry, including us. For a description of our regulatory requirements, see “Business—Certain Regulatory Matters.”Ally is subject to ongoing supervision, examination and regulation by the FRB, and Ally Bank by the FDIC and the Utah DFI, in each case, through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management’s ability to identify, assess, and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe-and-sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Ally is currently required by its banking supervisors to make improvements in areas such as board and senior management oversight, risk management, regulatory reporting, internal audit planning, capital adequacy process, stress testing, and Bank Secrecy Act / anti-money-laundering compliance, and to continue to reduce problem assets. Separately, Ally Bank is currently required by its banking supervisors to make improvements in areas such as compliance management and training, consumer protection monitoring, consumer complaint resolution, internal audit program and residential mortgage loan pricing, and fee monitoring. These requirements are judicially enforceable, and if we are unable to implement and maintain these required actions, plans, policies and procedures in a timely and effective manner and otherwise comply with the requirements outlined above, we could become subject to formal supervisory actions which could subject us to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to develop any new business. Such forms of supervisory action could include, without limitation, written agreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and enforcement of such action through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.Our ability to engage in certain activities may be adversely affected by our status as a bank holding company.As a bank holding company, Ally’s activities are generally limited to banking or to managing or controlling banks or to other activities deemed closely related to banking or otherwise permissible under the BHC Act and related regulations. Likewise, subject to certain exceptions, Ally is not permitted to acquire more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any nonaffiliated bank or bank holding company, directly or indirectly, or to acquire control of any other company, directly or indirectly (including by acquisition of 25% or more of a class of voting shares). Upon our bank holding company approval, we were permitted an initial two-year grace period to bring our activities and investments into conformity with these restrictions. This grace period expired in December 2010. The FRB then granted two one-year extensions that expired in December 2012, and recently granted a third and final one-year extension that expires in December 2013. We will not be permitted to apply to the FRB for any further extensions. Certain of Ally’s existing activities and investments are deemed impermissible under the BHC Act and must be terminated or disposed of by the expiration of this extension, the most significant of which includes most of our insurance activities and our SmartAuction vehicle remarketing services for third parties. While these activities may be continued if Ally is able to convert to a financial holding company under the BHC Act, Ally may be unable to satisfy the requirements to enable it to convert to a financial holding company prior to that time, and activities, businesses, or investments that would be permissible for a financial holding company will need to be terminated or disposed of. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.As a bank holding company, our ability to expand into new business activities would require us to obtain the prior approval of the relevant banking supervisors. There can be no assurance that any required approval will be obtained or that we will be able to execute on any such plans in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to obtain approval to expand into new business activities, our business, results of operations, and financial position may be materially adversely affected.Our ability to execute our business strategy may be affected by regulatory considerations.Our business strategy for Ally Bank, which is primarily focused on automotive lending and growth of our direct-channel deposit business, is subject to regulatory oversight from a safety and soundness perspective. If our banking supervisors raise concerns regarding any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank, we may be obliged to alter our strategy, which could include moving certain activities, such as certain types of lending, outside of Ally Bank to one of our nonbanking affiliates. Alternative funding sources outside of Ally Bank, such as asset securitization or financings in the capital markets, could be more expensive than funding through Ally Bank and could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to new capital planning and systemic risk regimes, which impose significant restrictions and requirements.As a bank holding company with $50 billion or more of consolidated assets, Ally is required to conduct periodic stress tests and submit a proposed capital action plan to the FRB every January, which the FRB must take action on by the following March. The proposed capital 11Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kaction plan must include a description of all planned capital actions over a nine-quarter planning horizon, including any issuance of a debt or equity capital instrument, any capital distribution, and any similar action that the FRB determines could have an impact on Ally’s consolidated capital. The proposed capital action plan must also include a discussion of how Ally will maintain capital above the minimum regulatory capital ratios and above a Tier 1 common equity-to-total risk-weighted assets ratio of 5 percent, and serve as a source of strength to Ally Bank. The FRB's capital plan rule requires that Ally receive no objection from the FRB prior to making a capital distribution. Ally submitted its capital plan in January 2013. Failure to obtain no objection to this plan could limit our ability to pay dividends, redeem or repurchase securities, or take other capital actions in the future.In addition, in December 2011, the FRB proposed rules to implement certain provisions of the systemic risk regime under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). If adopted as proposed, among other provisions, the rules would require Ally to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event and implement various liquidity-related corporate governance measures; limit Ally’s aggregate exposure to any unaffiliated counterparty to 25% of Ally’s capital and surplus; and potentially subject Ally to an early remediation regime that could limit the ability of Ally to pay dividends or expand its business if the FRB identified Ally as suffering from financial or management weaknesses. The systemic risk provisions, when implemented, could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our funding strategy, and we have increased our reliance on deposits as an alternative source of funding through Ally Bank. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network, and it obtains its deposits through direct banking and brokered deposits which, at December 31, 2012, included $9.4 billion of brokered certificates of deposit that may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher interest rates. At December 31, 2012, brokered deposits represented 20% of Ally Bank total deposits. Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected by regulatory restrictions including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements, restrictions on deposit growth, or restrictions on our rates offered. In addition, perceptions of our financial strength, rates offered by third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact our ability to grow our deposit base. Even if we are able to grow the deposit base of Ally Bank, our regulators may impose restrictions on our ability to use Ally Bank deposits as a source of funding for certain business activities potentially raising the cost of funding those activities without the use of Ally Bank deposits.The regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.Our domestic operations are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions relating to supervision and regulation by state and federal authorities. Such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers, not for the benefit of investors in our securities, and could limit our discretion in operating our business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.Ally, Ally Bank, and many of our nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank and other regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. This regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors, the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Changes to statutes, regulations, rules, or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing financial services and products.Our operations are also heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the United States. For example, certain of our foreign subsidiaries operate either as a bank or a regulated finance company, and our insurance operations are subject to various requirements in the foreign markets in which we operate. The varying requirements of these jurisdictions may be inconsistent with U.S. rules and may materially adversely affect our business or limit necessary regulatory approvals, or if approvals are obtained, we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations. In addition, in many countries, the regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving.Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to the affected product and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, or that we will not be prohibited by local laws or regulators from raising interest rates above certain desired levels, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, or results of operations.Financial services legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.The Dodd-Frank Act, which became law in July 2010, has and will continue to substantially change the legal and regulatory framework under which we operate. Certain portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, and others have become effective since enactment, while others are subject to further rulemaking and discretion of various regulatory bodies. The Dodd-Frank Act, when fully implemented, will have material implications for Ally and the entire financial services industry. Among other things, it will or potentially could:12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K•result in Ally being subject to enhanced oversight and scrutiny as a result of being a bank holding company with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets;•affect the levels of capital and liquidity with which Ally must operate and how it plans capital and liquidity levels;•subject Ally to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees to the FDIC;•impact a number of Ally’s business and risk management strategies;•restrict the revenue that Ally generates from certain businesses;•require Ally to provide to the Federal Reserve and FDIC an annual plan for its rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress; and•subject Ally to a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has very broad rule-making, examination, and enforcement authorities.In light of the further study and rulemaking required to fully implement the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as the discretion afforded to federal regulators, the full impact of this legislation on Ally, its business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years. In addition, regulations may impact us differently in comparison to other more established financial institutions. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are likely to adversely affect Ally and its financial performance. The extent to which Ally can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not knowable at this time.Our business may be adversely affected upon our implementation of the revised capital requirements under the Basel III capital rules.In December 2010, the Bank for International Settlements’ Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopted new capital, leverage, and liquidity guidelines under the Basel Accord (Basel III), which when implemented in the United States, may have the effect of raising capital requirements beyond those required by current law and the Dodd-Frank Act. In June 2012, the U.S. banking regulators proposed rules to implement many aspects of Basel III (the U.S. Basel III proposals). The U.S. Basel III proposals contain new capital standards that raise the quality of capital and strengthen counterparty credit risk capital requirements and introduce a leverage ratio as a supplemental measure to the risk-based ratio. The proposals include a new capital conservation buffer, which imposes a common equity requirement above the new minimum that can be depleted under stress, and could result in restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses under certain circumstances. The U.S. Basel III proposals also provide for a potential countercyclical buffer that regulators can activate during periods of excessive credit growth in their jurisdiction. The U.S. Basel III proposals contemplate that the new capital requirements would be phased in over several years, beginning in 2013. In November 2012, the U.S. banking regulators announced that the U.S. Basel III proposals would not become effective on January 1, 2013. The announcement did not specify new implementation or phase-in dates for the U.S. Basel III proposals.The Basel III rules and the Dodd-Frank Act, when implemented, will over time impose limits on Ally’s ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through the use of mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), trust preferred securities, or other “hybrid” securities, if applicable. At December 31, 2012, Ally had $857 million of MSRs and $2.5 billion of trust preferred securities, which were included as Tier 1 capital. Ally currently has no other “hybrid” securities outstanding. Pending final U.S. implementation of rules for Basel III and subsequent regulatory interpretation, there remains a degree of uncertainty on the full impact of Basel III.If we or Ally Bank fail to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, we or Ally Bank may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to informal or formal supervisory actions by the FRB and/or FDIC and, potentially, FDIC receivership of Ally Bank. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by governmental fiscal and monetary policies.The actions of the FRB and international central banking authorities directly impact our cost of funds for lending, capital raising, and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, such changes in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to predict.In addition, our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The FRB’s policies influence the new and used vehicle financing market, which significantly affects the earnings of our businesses. The FRB’s policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KFuture consumer legislation could harm our competitive position.In addition to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, various legislative bodies have also recently been considering altering the existing framework governing creditors’ rights, including legislation that would result in or allow loan modifications of various sorts. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business; limit or expand permissible activities; or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on our activities, financial condition, or results of operations.Ally and its subsidiaries are involved in investigations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies, which may lead to material adverse consequences.Ally and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are and may become involved from time to time in reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal), and information-gathering requests, by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the FRB, FDIC, Utah DFI, CFPB, SEC, and the Federal Trade Commission regarding their respective operations. Such requests include subpoenas from each of the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice. We continue to respond to subpoenas and document requests from the SEC, seeking information covering a wide range of mortgage-related matters, including, among other things, various aspects surrounding securitizations of residential mortgages. The subpoenas received from the U.S. Department of Justice include a broad request for documentation and other information in connection with its investigation of potential fraud and other potential legal violations related to mortgage backed securities, as well as the origination and/or underwriting of mortgage loans. In addition, the CFPB has recently advised us that they are investigating certain of our retail financing practices. These matters, or any other investigation or information-gathering request, may result in material adverse consequences including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions.Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the impact of affiliate transaction restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions.Certain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank “affiliates,” including but not limited to Ally Financial Inc. are subject to federal statutory and regulatory restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, “covered transactions,” including Ally Bank’s extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its nonbank affiliates, generally (1) are limited to 10% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus with respect to transactions with any individual affiliate, with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Bank’s capital stock and surplus for all affiliates and all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credit transactions, are subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a “low quality asset” under federal banking guidelines; and (4) must be conducted in accordance with safe-and-sound banking practices (collectively, the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). Furthermore, there is an “attribution rule” that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party must be treated as a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, a nonbank affiliate of Ally Bank. Retail financing transactions by Ally Bank involving vehicles for which Ally provided floorplan financing are subject to the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions because the proceeds of the retail financings are deemed to benefit, and are ultimately transferred to, Ally.Under the Dodd-Frank Act, among other changes to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, credit exposures resulting from derivatives transactions, securities lending and borrowing transactions, and acceptance of affiliate-issued debt obligations (other than securities) as collateral for a loan or extension of credit will be treated as ""covered transactions."" The Dodd-Frank Act also expands the scope of covered transactions required to be collateralized and places limits on acceptable collateral.Historically, the FRB was authorized to exempt, in its discretion, transactions or relationships with affiliates from the requirements of these rules if it found such exemptions to be in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the rules. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, exemptions now may be granted by the FDIC if the FDIC and FRB jointly find that the exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the rules, and the FDIC finds that the exemption does not present an unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FRB granted several such exemptions to Ally Bank in the past. However, the existing exemptions are subject to various conditions and, particularly in light of the statutory changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, any requests for future exemptions may not be granted. Moreover, these limited exemptions generally do not encompass consumer leasing or used vehicle financing. Since there is no assurance that Ally Bank will be able to obtain future exemptions or waivers with respect to these restrictions, the ability to grow Ally Bank’s business will be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions.Ally Financial Inc. may require distributions in the future from its subsidiaries.We currently fund Ally Financial Inc.’s obligations, including dividend payments to our preferred shareholders, and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness, from cash generated by Ally Financial Inc. In the future, Ally Financial Inc. may not generate sufficient funds at the parent company level to fund its obligations. As such, it may require dividends, distributions, or other payments from its subsidiaries to fund its obligations. However, regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit the ability of Ally Financial Inc.’s subsidiaries to transfer funds freely to Ally Financial Inc. In particular, many of Ally Financial Inc.’s subsidiaries are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to it or that prohibit such transfers entirely in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations, and rules may hinder Ally Financial Inc.’s ability to access funds that it may need to make payments on its obligations in the future. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, Ally Financial Inc. may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations 14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kon its ability to pay dividends. The bank regulators have the authority and, under certain circumstances, the duty to prohibit or to limit payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ally Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries.Current and future increases in FDIC insurance premiums, including the FDIC special assessment imposed on all FDIC-insured institutions, could decrease our earnings.Beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2012, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF). In May 2009, the FDIC announced that it had voted to levy a special assessment on insured institutions in order to facilitate the rebuilding of the DIF. In September 2009, the FDIC voted to adopt an increase in the risk-based assessment rate effective beginning January 1, 2011, by three basis points. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act alters the calculation of an insured institution’s deposit base for purposes of deposit insurance assessments and removes the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing these changes, which took effect on April 1, 2011. The FDIC will continue to assess the changes to the assessment rates at least annually. Future deposit premiums paid by Ally Bank depend on the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. Any increases in deposit insurance assessments could decrease our earnings.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe profitability and financial condition of our operations are heavily dependent upon the performance, operations, and prospects of GM and Chrysler.GM and Chrysler dealers and their retail customers compose a significant portion of our customer base, and our Dealer Financial Services operations are highly dependent on GM and Chrysler production and sales volume. In 2012, 63% of our U.S. new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 59% of our U.S. new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for GM franchised dealers and customers, and 28% of our U.S. new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 32% of our U.S. new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for Chrysler dealers and customers.We are currently party to agreements with each of GM and Chrysler that provide for certain exclusivity privileges related to subvention programs offered by each of them. On April 25, 2012, Chrysler provided us with notification of nonrenewal for the existing agreement, and as a result our agreement with Chrysler will expire in April 2013. Further, Chrysler has recently announced that it has entered into a ten-year agreement with Santander Consumer USA Inc. (Santander), pursuant to which Santander will provide a full range of wholesale and retail financing services to Chrysler dealers and consumers, beginning in May 2013. In addition, our agreement with GM will expire in December 2013. These agreements provided Ally with certain preferred provider benefits, including limiting the use of other financing providers by GM and Chrysler in their incentive programs. We cannot predict the ultimate impact that the expiration of these agreements will have on our operations. However, the expiration of these agreements will likely increase competitive pressure on Ally, as some competitors have or could have exclusive agreements with GM and/or Chrysler.On October 1, 2010, GM acquired AmeriCredit Corp. (which GM subsequently renamed General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GMF)), an independent automotive finance company that focuses on providing leasing and subprime financing options. Further, and as previously announced, we have entered into an agreement with GMF pursuant to which GMF will purchase our automotive finance operations in Europe and Latin America, as well as our interest in a joint venture in China. As GMF continues to grow, and as GM directs additional business to GMF, it could reduce GM's reliance on our services over time, which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. In addition, it is possible that GM or other automotive manufacturers could utilize other existing companies to support their financing needs including offering products or terms that we would not or could not offer, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. Furthermore, other automotive manufacturers could expand or establish or acquire captive finance companies to support their financing needs thus reducing their need for our services.A significant adverse change in GM’s or Chrysler’s business, including the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the use of GM or Chrysler marketing incentives; GM’s or Chrysler’s relationships with its key suppliers; or GM’s or Chrysler’s relationship with the United Auto Workers and other labor unions and other factors impacting GM or Chrysler or their respective employees, or significant adverse changes in their respective liquidity position and access to the capital markets; could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.There is no assurance that the global automotive market or GM’s and Chrysler’s respective share of that market will not suffer downturns in the future, and any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Our liquidity and the long-term viability of Ally depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully raise capital and secure appropriate bank financing. We are currently required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 15% at Ally Bank, which will require that Ally maintain substantial equity funds in Ally Bank and inject substantial additional equity funds into Ally Bank as Ally Bank’s assets increase over time.15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KWe have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding, it continues to remain a critical component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2012, approximately $1.3 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2013, and approximately $5.6 billion and $5.1 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2014 and 2015, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2012, a total of $3.1 billion in principal amount of Demand Notes were outstanding. We also rely on secured funding. At December 31, 2012, approximately $11.5 billion of outstanding consolidated secured debt is scheduled to mature in 2013, approximately $13.6 billion is scheduled to mature in 2014, and approximately $8.6 billion is scheduled to mature in 2015. Furthermore, at December 31, 2012, approximately $15.7 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2013, which is not included in the 2013 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a material portion of the debt maturities over these periods. The capital markets continue to be volatile, and Ally’s access to the debt markets may be significantly reduced during periods of market stress. In addition, we will continue to have significant original issue discount amortization expenses (OID expense) in the near future, which will adversely affect our net income and resulting capital position. OID expense was $349 million in 2012, and the remaining scheduled amortization of OID is $261 million, $188 million, and $56 million in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively.As a result of the volatility in the markets and our current unsecured debt ratings, we have increased our reliance on various secured debt markets. Although market conditions have improved, there can be no assurances that this will continue. In addition, we continue to rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions and a tightening of credit availability could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While markets have continued to stabilize following the 2008 liquidity crisis, there can be no assurances these sources of liquidity will remain available to us. Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could materially and adversely affect our business.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2012, we had approximately $82.8 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $45.1 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 48% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2012. In addition, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2012, we declared and paid preferred stock dividends of $802 million in the aggregate.We have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.The worldwide financial services industry is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully or if there is increased competition in the automotive financing and/or insurance markets or generally in the markets for securitizations or asset sales, our business could be negatively affected.The markets for automotive financing, banking, and insurance are highly competitive. The market for automotive financing has grown more competitive as more consumers are financing their vehicle purchases and as more competitors continue to enter this market as a result of how well automotive finance assets generally performed relative to other asset classes during the 2008 economic downturn. More recently, competition for automotive financing has further intensified as a growing number of banks have become increasingly interested in automotive-finance assets, which has resulted in pressure on our net interest margins. For example, on April 1, 2011, TD Bank Group announced the closing of its acquisition of Chrysler Financial, which could enhance Chrysler Financial’s ability to expand its product offerings and may result in increased competition. Ally Bank faces significant competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage companies, and other financial institutions. Our insurance business faces significant competition from insurance carriers, reinsurers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, substantially lower costs of capital, and are much less reliant on securitization activities, unsecured debt, and other public markets. Our competitors may be subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes than we are, thus putting us at a competitive disadvantage to these competitors. We face significant competition in most areas including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our profitability and financial condition could be negatively affected.The markets for asset securitizations and whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In addition, lenders and other investors within those markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers, originators, and asset classes, or they may require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased issuance by other participants in the market or decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure to (or to require a higher yield for) us or to automotive securitizations or whole-loans could negatively affect our ability and that of our subsidiaries to price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us.16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents management’s best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans, all as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, accounting rules and related guidance, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.Bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. An increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.The previously contemplated plan and settlement related to the ResCap bankruptcy has been allowed to lapse by ResCap, and as a result, there is substantial uncertainty related to resolution of the bankruptcy and substantial claims could be brought against us.On May 14, 2012 (the Petition Date), Residential Capital, LLC (ResCap) and certain of its wholly owned direct and indirect subsidiaries (collectively, the Debtors) filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). In connection with the filings in May, Ally Financial Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries and affiliates (excluding the Debtors) (collectively, AFI) had reached an agreement with the Debtors and certain creditor constituencies on a prearranged Chapter 11 plan (the Plan). The Plan included a proposed settlement (the Settlement) between AFI and the Debtors, which included, among other things, an obligation of AFI to make a $750 million cash contribution to the Debtor's estate, and a release of all existing or potential causes of action between AFI and the Debtors, as well as a release of all existing or potential ResCap-related causes of action against AFI held by third parties.The Settlement contemplated certain milestone requirements that the Debtors failed to satisfy, including the Bankruptcy Court's confirmation of the Plan on or before October 31, 2012. While the failure to meet this October 31 milestone would have resulted in the Settlement's automatic termination, AFI and the Debtors agreed to monthly temporary waivers of this automatic termination through February 28, 2013. This waiver was not extended beyond this date, and therefore the Settlement has terminated.As of the Petition Date, institutional investors in residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS Investors) issued by ResCap's affiliates and holding more than 25 percent of at least one class in each of 290 securitizations agreed to settle alleged representation and warranty claims against the Debtors' estates in exchange for a total $8.7 billion allowed claim in the Debtors' bankruptcy cases, subject to the applicable securitization trustees' acceptance of the terms of the settlements (the RMBS Settlements). The RMBS Investors also signed separate plan support agreements (PSAs) with the Debtors and AFI in support of the Plan at the time of entering into the RMBS Settlements. To date, RMBS Investors holding more than 25 percent of at least one class in each of 336 securitizations have agreed to the RMBS Settlements. These 336 securitizations have an aggregate original principal balance of approximately $189 billion (out of a total of 392 outstanding securitizations with an original principal balance of $221 billion). The RMBS Settlements are subject to Bankruptcy Court approval, and the Bankruptcy Court has scheduled a hearing to consider such approval in late May 2013. The PSAs are not part of this scheduled Bankruptcy Court hearing. A number of creditors have raised objections to the RMBS Settlements, but the trustees representing the 336 securitization trusts and AFI have filed statements in support of the Debtors' motion to approve the RMBS Settlements. Separately, the Debtors have failed to meet several Plan milestones in their bankruptcy cases, each of which has given the RMBS Investors the right to terminate the PSAs upon three business days advance written notice to the Debtors and AFI. The RMBS Investors have not given the Debtors and AFI such a notice to date, but have the right to do so at any time. If the RMBS Settlements were not approved or the RMBS Investors were to decide not to support any proposed plan, it could adversely impact the likelihood that any plan is approved by the Bankruptcy Court. AFI continues to support the RMBS Settlements at this time.On June 4, 2012, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. filed a motion in the Bankruptcy Court for the appointment of an independent examiner to investigate, among other things, certain of the Debtors' transactions with AFI occurring prior to the Petition Date, any claims the Debtors may hold against AFI's officers and directors, and any claims the Debtors proposed to release under the Plan. On June 20, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court approved the appointment of an examiner and, subsequently, the United States Trustee for the Southern District of New York appointed former bankruptcy judge Arthur J. Gonzalez, Esq. as the examiner (the Examiner). On July 27, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the scope of the Examiner's investigation. The investigation includes, among other things: (a) all material pre-petition transactions between or among the Debtors and AFI, Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. and its subsidiaries and affiliates, and/or Ally Bank; (b) certain post-petition negotiations and transactions with the Debtors, including with respect to plan sponsor, plan support, and settlement agreements, the debtor-in-possession financing with AFI, the stalking horse asset purchase agreement with AFI, and the servicing agreement with Ally Bank; (c) all state and federal law claims or causes of action the Debtors proposed to release as part of the Plan; and (d) the release of all existing or potential ResCap-related causes of action against AFI held by third parties. In the Examiner's original work plan, the Examiner estimated that his investigation and related report would be completed six months from approximately August 6, 2012. However, on February 17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-K7, 2013 the Examiner informed the Bankruptcy Court in the third supplement to the work plan that the investigation and related report will not be completed until early May 2013.On December 26, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court, in an effort to facilitate plan negotiations, entered an order appointing bankruptcy judge James M. Peck, Esq. as mediator to assist the parties in resolving certain issues relating to the formulation and confirmation of the Plan. There can be no assurance that the mediation process will continue or will ultimately lead to a successful agreement among the parties.On February 26, 2013, the official committee of unsecured creditors appointed in the Debtors' bankruptcy cases (the Creditors' Committee) filed with the Bankruptcy Court a response to the Debtors' motions for appointment of a chief restructuring officer and to extend their exclusive period to file a chapter 11 plan, which, among other things, states that the Creditors' Committee supports such extension through and including April 30, 2013, and during such time the Creditors' Committee will agree not to bring any claims against AFI. The response further states that the Debtors consent to the Creditors' Committee seeking standing in the Bankruptcy Court to prosecute and/or settle the Debtors' alleged claims against AFI and agree to settle claims against AFI only with Creditors' Committee consent. On February 27, 2013, the Debtors filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court seeking, for purposes of any proposed chapter 11 plan, that GMAC Mortgage's obligation to conduct and pay for independent file review regarding certain residential foreclosure actions and foreclosure sales prosecuted by GMAC Mortgage and its subsidiaries, as required under the Consent Order, be classified as a general unsecured claim in an amount to be determined, and that the automatic stay under the Bankruptcy Code be applied to prevent the FRB, the FDIC, and other governmental entities from taking any action to enforce the obligation against the Debtors. If the Bankruptcy Court approves the motion, such governmental entities are likely to seek to enforce the obligation against AFI, and any such obligations ultimately borne by AFI could be material. The Debtors have requested that the motion be heard at a hearing on March 21, 2013.We are currently named as defendants in various lawsuits relating to ResCap mortgage-backed securities and certain other mortgage-related matters, which are described in more detail in Note 29 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The majority of these matters are currently subject to orders entered by the Bankruptcy Court staying the matters through either March 31, 2012 or April 30, 2013. Unless the Debtors seek and obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to extend these stay orders, these matters are expected to proceed against us once the applicable stay orders expire.As a result of the termination of the Settlement, AFI is no longer obligated to make the $750 million cash contribution and neither party is bound by the Settlement. Further, AFI is not entitled to receive any releases from either the Debtors or any third party claimants, as was contemplated under the Plan and Settlement. However, AFI has not withdrawn its offer to provide a $750 million cash contribution to the Debtors' estate if an acceptable settlement can be reached. As a result of the termination of the Settlement, substantial claims could be brought against us, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.We are exposed to consumer credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. Furthermore, a weak economic environment and high unemployment rates could exert pressure on our consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions, and losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies, and loss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent a further adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. We have begun to increase our nonprime automobile financing. We define nonprime consumer automobile loans as those loans with a FICO score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. In addition, we have increased our used automobile financing. Borrowers that finance used vehicles tend to have lower FICO scores as compared to new vehicle borrowers, and defaults resulting from vehicle breakdowns are more likely to occur with used vehicles as compared to new vehicles that are financed. At December 31, 2012, the carrying value of our Automotive Finance operations nonprime consumer automobile loans before allowance for loan losses was $5.1 billion, or approximately 9.4% of our total consumer automobile loans. Of these loans, $62 million were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with internal loan policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. As we grow our nonprime automobile financing loans over time, our credit risk may increase. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased.General business and economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased short and long term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the debt capital markets, unemployment rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or a decline in the strength of national and local economies and other factors that negatively affect household incomes could decrease demand for our financing products and increase financing delinquency and losses on our customer and dealer financing operations. We have been negatively affected due to the significant stress in the residential real estate and related capital markets and, in particular, the lack of home price appreciation in many markets in which we lend. Further, a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices could lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases and negatively affect our automotive finance business.If the rate of inflation were to increase, or if the debt capital markets or the economies of the United States were to weaken, or if home prices or new and used vehicle purchases experience declines, we could be significantly and adversely affected, and it could become more 18Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kexpensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to our businesses could decrease (1) the demand for our new and used vehicle financing and (2) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of held-for-investment assets and new and used vehicle loans and interests that continue to be held by us, thus further increasing the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans. In addition, the rate of delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses on our loans could be higher during more severe economic slowdowns.Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses could further harm our ability to sell our new and used vehicle loans, the prices we receive for our new and used vehicle loans, or the value of our portfolio of mortgage and new and used vehicle loans held-for-investment or interests from our securitizations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Continued adverse business and economic conditions could affect demand for new and used vehicles, housing, the cost of construction, and other related factors that could harm the revenues and profitability of our business.The current debt crisis in Europe, the risk that certain countries may default on their sovereign debt, and recent rating agency actions with respect to European countries and the United States and the resulting impact on the financial markets, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position.The current crisis in Europe has created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European Union countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations. In the past several years, rating agencies have lowered their ratings on several euro-zone countries. The continuation of the European debt crisis has adversely impacted financial markets and has created substantial volatility and uncertainty, and will likely continue to do so. Risks related to this have had, and are likely to continue to have, a negative impact on global economic activity and the financial markets. The effects of the European debt crisis could be even more significant if a Eurozone country determines to depart the European Monetary Union, which would lead to redenomination of obligations of obligors in that country and cause foreign exchange, operational, and settlement disruptions. In addition, on August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America to ‘AA+’ from ‘AAA’, and the outlook on its long-term rating is negative. The U.S. downgrade, any future downgrades, as well as the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations, including uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal deficit and debt ceiling debate, could impact our ability to obtain, and the pricing with respect to, funding that is collateralized by affected instruments and obtained through the secured and unsecured markets. As these conditions persist, our business, results of operation, and financial position could be materially adversely affected.Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.Geopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.The U.S. Department of Treasury (Treasury) holds a majority of the outstanding common stock.At February 28, 2013, Treasury held 981,971 shares of common stock, which represents approximately 74% of the voting power of the holders of common stock outstanding for matters requiring a vote of the holders of common stock. In addition, as of the date hereof, Treasury holds 118,750,000 shares of Series F-2 Preferred Stock (which are convertible into shares of common stock in accordance with Ally's certificate of incorporation), with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $5.9 billion.Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Governance Agreement dated May 21, 2009, as of the date hereof, Treasury also has the right to appoint six of the eleven members to our board of directors. As a result of this stock ownership interest and Treasury's right to appoint six directors to our board of directors, Treasury has the ability to exert control, through its power to vote for the election of our directors, over various matters. To the extent Treasury elects to exert such control over us, its interests (as a government entity) may differ from those of our other stockholders and it may influence, through its ability to vote for the election of our directors, matters including:•the selection, tenure and compensation of our management;•our business strategy and product offerings;•our relationship with our employees and other constituencies; and•our financing activities, including the issuance of debt and equity securities.In particular, Treasury may have a greater interest in promoting U.S. economic growth and jobs than our other stockholders. In the future we may also become subject to new and additional laws and government regulations regarding various aspects of our business as a result of participation in the TARP program and the U.S. government's ownership in our business. These regulations and actions by directors could make it more difficult for us to compete with other companies that are not subject to similar regulations.19Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KThe limitations on compensation imposed on us due to our participation in TARP, including the restrictions placed on our compensation by the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, may adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate our executives and employees.Our performance is largely dependent on the talent and efforts of our management team and employees. As a result of our participation in TARP, the compensation of certain members of our management team and employees is subject to extensive restrictions under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the ARRA), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, as implemented by the Interim Final Rule issued by Treasury on June 15, 2009 (the IFR). In addition, due to our level of participation in TARP, pursuant to ARRA and the IFR, the Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation has the authority to further regulate our compensation arrangements with certain of our executives and employees. In addition, we may become subject to further restrictions under any other future legislation or regulation limiting executive compensation. Many of the restrictions are not limited to our senior executives and affect other employees whose contributions to revenue and performance may be significant. These limitations may leave us unable to create a compensation structure that permits us to retain and motivate certain of our executives and employees or to attract new executives or employees, especially if we are competing against institutions that are not subject to the same restrictions. Any such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor’s Rating Services; Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates our debt. Our current ratings as assigned by each of the respective rating agencies are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the unsecured market. Ratings reflect the rating agencies’ opinions of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. On February 2, 2012, Fitch downgraded our senior debt to BB- from BB and changed the outlook to negative. Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing costs and further constrain our access to the unsecured debt markets and, as a result, would negatively affect our business. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as impact elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements.Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency’s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency’s rating.Our profitability and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the residual value of off-lease vehicles decrease in the future.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination, is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we incur additional depreciation expense and/or a loss on the lease transaction. General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, new vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price and volatility of gasoline or diesel fuel, among other factors, heavily influence used vehicle prices and thus the actual residual value of off-lease vehicles. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during 2008, sharp declines in demand and used vehicle sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Vehicle brand images, consumer preference, and vehicle manufacturer marketing programs that influence new and used vehicle markets also influence lease residual values. In addition, our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and proceeds realized from the vehicle sales. While manufacturers, at times, may provide support for lease residual values including through residual support programs, this support does not in all cases entitle us to full reimbursement for the difference between the remarketing sales proceeds for off-lease vehicles and the residual value specified in the lease contract. Differences between the actual residual values realized on leased vehicles and our expectations of such values at contract inception could have a negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.Significant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or loan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive receivable, the servicer may be required by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets or other payments occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the result could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.20Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KA loss of contractual servicing rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.We are the servicer for all of the receivables we have acquired or originated and transferred to other parties in securitizations and whole-loan sales of automotive receivables. We are paid a fee for these services, which fees in the aggregate constitute a substantial revenue stream for us. In each case, we are subject to the risk of termination under the circumstances specified in the applicable servicing provisions.In most securitizations and whole-loan sales, the owner of the receivables will be entitled to declare a servicer default and terminate the servicer upon the occurrence of specified events. These events typically include a bankruptcy of the servicer, a material failure by the servicer to perform its obligations, and a failure by the servicer to turn over funds on the required basis. The termination of these servicing rights, were it to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.Our earnings may decrease because of decreases or increases in interest rates.We are subject to risks from decreasing interest rates, particularly given the Federal Reserve’s recent steps to keep interest rates low in an attempt to improve economic growth. A low interest rate environment or a flat or inverted yield curve may adversely affect certain of our businesses by compressing net interest margins or reducing the amounts we earn on our investment securities portfolio, thereby reducing our net interest income and other revenues.Rising interest rates could also have an adverse impact on our business as well. For example, rising interest rates:•will increase our cost of funds;•may reduce our consumer automotive financing volume by influencing customers to pay cash for, as opposed to financing, vehicle purchases or not to buy new vehicles;•may negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease vehicles; and•will generally reduce the value of automotive financing loans and contracts and retained interests and fixed income securities held in our investment portfolio.Throughout 2009 and 2010 the credit risk embedded in the balance sheet was reduced as a result of asset sales, asset markdowns, and a change in the mix of our loan assets as the legacy portfolios were replaced with assets underwritten to tighter credit standards. This reduction in risk has resulted in a mix of assets outstanding on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2012, with a lower yielding profile than the prior year. During this same period of time we experienced a significant decline in our consumer automotive operating lease portfolio that was realizing higher yields from remarketing gains due to historically high used vehicle prices. The combination of the above factors resulted in a decline in asset yields more than the decline in liability rates, and therefore the decline in the net interest spread on the balance sheet throughout 2010 and into 2011.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could affect our profitability and financial condition as could our failure to comply with hedge accounting principles and interpretations.We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the application of significant subjective judgments to a body of accounting concepts that is complex.A failure of or interruption in, as well as, security risks of the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely as a result of inadequate or failed processes or systems, human errors, employee misconduct, catastrophic events, or other external events could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer applications being received, slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in servicing. In addition, our communication and information systems may present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft. For example, similar to other large financial institutions, Ally's website, ally.com, was recently the subject of cyber attacks that resulted in slow performance and unavailability of the website for some customers. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of our assets. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including certain held-for-investment and held-for-sale loans for which we elected fair value accounting, retained interests from securitizations of loans and contracts, MSRs, and other 21Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kinvestments, which do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for legal matters, insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements. For further discussion related to estimates and assumptions, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Critical Accounting Estimates.” Our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. A material difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects.Fluctuations in valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues.Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation. Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value and could negatively affect our revenues. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, national and international events, and general market conditions.Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC, banking regulators, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.Recently, the FASB has proposed new financial accounting standards, and has many active projects underway, that could materially affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition. These proposed standards or projects include the potential for significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments (including loans, deposits, allowance for loan losses, and debt) and the accounting for leases, among others. It is possible that any changes, if enacted, could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty.Our inability to maintain relationships with dealers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our business depends on the continuation of our relationships with our customers, particularly the automotive dealers with whom we do business. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with key automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason, including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis or offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in states in which we have customer concentrations may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.We are exposed to consumer loan portfolio concentration in certain states, including California, Texas, and Florida. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these and other states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position"
1,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2012-02-28,"    Risk Factors
Our businesses face many risks and uncertainties, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties that we face are described below. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.Risks Related to RegulationOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by regulations to which we are subject as a result of our bank holding company status.We are a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). Many of the regulatory requirements to which we are subject as a bank holding company were not previously applicable to us and have and will continue to require significant expense and devotion of resources to fully implement necessary policies and procedures to ensure compliance. Compliance with such laws and regulations involves substantial costs and may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Recent events, particularly in the financial and real estate markets, have resulted in bank regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on participants in the financial services industry, including us. For a description of our regulatory requirements, see Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 1. Business.Ally is subject to ongoing supervision, examination and regulation by the FRB, and Ally Bank by the FDIC and the Utah DFI, in each case, through regular examinations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge management's ability to identify, assess, and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe-and-sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. Ally is currently required by its banking supervisors to make improvements in areas such as board and senior management oversight, risk management, regulatory reporting, internal audit planning, capital adequacy process, stress testing, and Bank Secrecy Act / anti-money-laundering compliance, and to continue to reduce problem assets. Separately, Ally Bank is currently required by its banking supervisors to make improvements in areas such as compliance management and training, consumer protection monitoring, consumer complaint resolution, internal audit program and residential mortgage loan pricing, and fee monitoring. These requirements are judicially enforceable, and if we are unable to implement and maintain these required actions, plans, policies and procedures in a timely and effective manner and otherwise comply with the requirements outlined above, we could become subject to formal supervisory actions which could subject us to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to develop any new business. Such forms of supervisory action could include, without limitation, written agreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities, the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and enforcement of such action through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.Our ability to engage in certain activities may be adversely affected by our status as a bank holding company.As a bank holding company, Ally's activities are generally limited to banking or to managing or controlling banks or to other activities deemed closely related to banking or otherwise permissible under the BHC Act and related regulations. Likewise, subject to certain exceptions, Ally is not permitted to acquire more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any nonaffiliated bank or bank holding company, directly or indirectly, or to acquire control of any other company, directly or indirectly (including by acquisition of 25% or more of a class of voting shares). Upon our bank holding company approval, we were permitted an initial two-year grace period to bring our activities and investments into conformity with these restrictions. This grace period expired in December 2010. The FRB initially granted a one-year extension that expired in December 2011, and recently granted a second one-year extension that expires in December 2012. We will be 11Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kpermitted to apply to the FRB for one additional one-year extension. Certain of Ally's existing activities and investments, including most of our insurance activities and our SmartAuction vehicle remarketing services for third parties, are deemed impermissible under the BHC Act and must be terminated or disposed of by the expiration of this extension and any additional extensions. While some of these activities may be continued if Ally is able to convert to a financial holding company under the BHC Act, Ally may be unable to satisfy the requirements to enable it to convert to a financial holding company prior to that time, and activities, businesses, or investments that would be permissible for a financial holding company will need to be terminated or disposed of. The FRB may also decline to grant any additional requested extensions, and Ally may be obligated to terminate or dispose of any impermissible activities, businesses, or investments more quickly than anticipated or under terms that are unfavorable to us. Either situation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.As a bank holding company, our ability to expand into new business activities would require us to obtain the prior approval of the relevant banking supervisors. There can be no assurance that any required approval will be obtained or that we will be able to execute on any such plans in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to obtain approval to expand into new business activities, our business, results of operations, and financial position may be materially adversely affected.Our business and financial condition could be further adversely affected as a result of issues relating to mortgage foreclosures, home sales, and evictions in certain states and our entry into a related consent order.Representatives of federal and state governments, including the United States Department of Justice, the FRB, the FDIC, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and law enforcement authorities in all 50 states, have been investigating the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks, including subsidiaries of Ally, in connection with mortgage foreclosure home sales and evictions. In connection with this, on February 9, 2012, we reached an agreement in principle with the federal government and 49 state attorneys general with respect to these matters, which resulted in a charge of approximately $230 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. This agreement in principle is subject to ongoing discussions among the parties and the completion of definitive documentation, as well as required regulatory and court approvals. It is possible that Ally or its subsidiaries could become subject to further penalties, sanctions, or other adverse actions related to these matters, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.On December 1, 2011, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts filed an enforcement action in the Suffolk County Superior Court against GMAC Mortgage and several other lender/servicers. The Commonwealth claims that certain aspects of defendants' foreclosure processes are unlawful, that defendants do not always process loan modification accurately, and that defendants' use of the Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems (MERS) has damaged the integrity of the Commonwealth's Torrens recording system. The Commonwealth seeks civil penalties, injunctive relief, costs and attorneys' fees. In connection with the settlement with the federal government and state attorneys general announced on February 9, 2012, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts agreed to settle all servicing-related claims asserted in this action and to certain limits on monetary damages, if any. However, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts continues to pursue claims related to MERS and certain foreclosure-related matters.As a result of an examination conducted by the FRB and FDIC, on April 13, 2011, each of Ally, Ally Bank, Residential Capital, LLC and GMAC Mortgage, LLC (collectively, the Ally Entities) entered into a Consent Order (the Consent Order) with the FRB and the FDIC. The Consent Order requires the Ally Entities to make improvements to various aspects of our residential mortgage loan-servicing business, including compliance programs, internal audit, communications with borrowers, vendor management, management information systems, employee training, and oversight by the boards of the Ally Entities. We estimate that incremental costs to the applicable mortgage companies for implementation and ongoing compliance related to these matters to be approximately $40 million annually during 2012 and 2013, and then reducing over time. The majority of these incremental annual costs are for additional servicing personnel, enhancements to information systems, vendor management, costs to comply with MERS requirements, and increased audit and compliance costs.The Consent Order further requires GMAC Mortgage, LLC to retain independent consultants to conduct a risk assessment related to mortgage servicing activities and, separately, to conduct a review of certain past residential mortgage foreclosure actions (Foreclosure Review). Based on current expectations, we estimate total costs to the applicable mortgage companies related to the Foreclosure Review to be up to $200 million, but it is possible that costs could be higher, particularly if the scope of the Foreclosure Review is expanded. We expect the majority of these costs to be incurred in 2012, although it is possible that such costs could be incurred over a longer period of time.We cannot estimate the ultimate impact of any deficiencies that have been or may be identified in the historical foreclosure procedures of certain of our mortgage subsidiaries (Mortgage Companies). There are potential risks related to these matters that extend beyond potential liability on individual foreclosure actions. Specific risks could include, for example, claims and litigation related to foreclosure remediation and resubmission; claims from investors that hold securities that become adversely impacted by continued delays in the foreclosure process, the reduction in foreclosure proceeds due to delay, or by challenges to completed foreclosure sales to the extent, if any, not covered by title insurance obtained in connection with such sales; actions by courts, state attorneys general, or regulators to delay further the foreclosure process after submission of corrected affidavits, or to facilitate claims by borrowers alleging that they were harmed by our foreclosure practices (by, for example, foreclosing without offering an appropriate range of alternative home preservation options); additional regulatory fines, sanctions, and other additional costs; and reputational risks. To date we have borne all out-of-pocket costs associated with the remediation rather than passing any such costs through to investors for whom we service the related mortgages, and we expect that we will continue to do so.12Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur ability to execute our business strategy may be affected by regulatory considerations.Our business strategy for Ally Bank, which is primarily focused on automotive lending and growth of our direct-channel deposit business, is subject to regulatory oversight from a safety and soundness perspective. If our banking supervisors raise concerns regarding any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank, we may be obliged to alter our strategy, which could include moving certain activities, such as certain types of lending, outside of Ally Bank to one of our nonbanking affiliates. Alternative funding sources outside of Ally Bank, such as asset securitization or financings in the capital markets, could be more expensive than funding through Ally Bank and could adversely effect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.We are subject to new capital planning and systemic risk regimes, which impose significant restrictions and requirements.Effective December 2011, the FRB requires bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, such as Ally, to submit annual capital plans for FRB non-objection. In the absence of a non-objection regarding the capital plan, the new regulation prohibits such bank holding companies from paying dividends or making certain other capital distributions without a specific FRB non-objection to such action. Even if a bank holding company receives a non-objection to its capital plan, it may not pay a dividend or make certain other capital distributions without FRB approval under certain circumstances (e.g., after giving effect to the dividend or distribution, the bank holding company would not meet a minimum regulatory capital ratio or a Tier 1 common ratio of at least 5%) and subject to certain exceptions. Ally submitted its first capital plan in January 2012, and it is unknown whether the FRB will accept Ally's plan as submitted or require revisions.In addition, in December 2011, the FRB proposed rules to implement certain provisions of the systemic risk regime under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). If adopted as proposed, among other provisions, the rules would require Ally to maintain a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assets to survive a projected 30-day liquidity stress event and implement various liquidity-related corporate governance measures; limit Ally's aggregate exposure to any unaffiliated counterparty to 25% of Ally's capital and surplus; and potentially subject Ally to an early remediation regime that could limit the ability of Ally to pay dividends or expand its business if the FRB identified Ally as suffering from financial or management weaknesses. The systemic risk provisions, when implemented, could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations, and financial condition.Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited.Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our funding strategy, and we have increased our reliance on deposits as an alternative source of funding through Ally Bank. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network, and it obtains its deposits through direct banking and brokered deposits which, at December 31, 2011, included $9.9 billion of brokered certificates of deposit that may be more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher interest rates. Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected by regulatory restrictions including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements, restrictions on deposit growth, or restrictions on our rates offered. In addition, perceptions of our financial strength, rates offered by third parties, and other competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact our ability to grow our deposit base. As we have established the Ally Bank brand and increased our retail deposit base over the past few years, we have reduced offered rates on new retail deposits. However, a strategy of continuing to offer reduced rates in the future could limit our ability to further grow or maintain deposits. Even if we are able to grow the deposit base of Ally Bank, our regulators may impose restrictions on our ability to use Ally Bank deposits as a source of funding for certain business activities potentially raising the cost of funding those activities without the use of Ally Bank deposits.The FDIC has indicated that it expects Ally to diversify Ally Bank's overall funding and to focus on reducing Ally Bank's overall funding costs including the interest rates paid on Ally Bank deposits. See Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity Management, Funding, and Regulatory Capital-Funding Strategy in Item 7. for additional information about these diversification activities. As stated above, over the past few years, we have reduced rates on retail deposits, as well as introduced new products, resulting in lower cost of funds for deposits. However, it is possible that further reductions of rates on retail deposits could limit Ally Bank's ability to grow or maintain deposits, which could have a material adverse impact on the funding and capital position of Ally.The regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.Our domestic operations are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictions relating to supervision and regulation by state and federal authorities. Such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers, not for the benefit of investors in our securities, and could limit our discretion in operating our business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.Ally, Ally Bank, and many of our nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank and other regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. This regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors, the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Changes to statutes, regulations, rules, or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer, limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing financial services and products.13Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur operations are also heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the United States. For example, certain of our foreign subsidiaries operate either as a bank or a regulated finance company, and our insurance operations are subject to various requirements in the foreign markets in which we operate. The varying requirements of these jurisdictions may be inconsistent with U.S. rules and may materially adversely affect our business or limit necessary regulatory approvals, or if approvals are obtained, we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations. In addition, in many countries, the regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving.Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to the affected product and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and regulations will not be adopted, or that we will not be prohibited by local laws or regulators from raising interest rates above certain desired levels, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, or results of operations.Financial services legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business and results of operations.The Dodd-Frank Act became law in July 2010. Portions of the Dodd-Frank Act were effective immediately, but many provisions will only be effective after the adoption of implementing regulations, which have been delayed in numerous cases. The Dodd-Frank Act, when fully implemented, will have material implications for Ally and the entire financial services industry. Among other things, it will or potentially could:•result in Ally being subject to enhanced oversight and scrutiny as a result of being a bank holding company with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets;•result in the appointment of the FDIC as receiver of Ally in an orderly liquidation proceeding if the Secretary of Treasury, upon recommendation of two-thirds of the FRB and the FDIC and in consultation with the President of the United States, finds Ally to be in default or danger of default;•affect the levels of capital and liquidity with which Ally must operate and how it plans capital and liquidity levels;•subject Ally to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees to the FDIC;•impact Ally's ability to invest in certain types of entities or engage in certain activities;•impact a number of Ally's business and risk management strategies;•restrict the revenue that Ally generates from certain businesses; and•subject Ally to a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which has very broad rule-making and enforcement authorities.As the Dodd-Frank Act requires that many studies be conducted and that hundreds of regulations be written in order to fully implement it, the full impact of this legislation on Ally, its business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years. In addition, regulations may impact us differently in comparison to other more established financial institutions. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are likely to adversely affect Ally and its financial performance. The extent to which Ally can adjust its strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not knowable at this time.Our business may be adversely affected upon our implementation of the revised capital requirements under the Basel III capital rules.The Bank for International Settlements' Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recently adopted new capital, leverage, and liquidity guidelines under the Basel Accord (Basel III), which when implemented in the United States, may have the effect of raising capital requirements beyond those required by current law and the Dodd-Frank Act. Basel III increases (i) the minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio from 2.0% to 4.5%, net of regulatory deductions, and introduces a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% of common equity to risk-weighted assets, raising the target minimum common equity ratio to 7.0% and (ii) the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5% inclusive of the capital conservation buffer, increases the minimum total capital ratio to 10.5% inclusive of the capital buffer, and introduces a countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital for periods of excess credit growth. Basel III also introduces a nonrisk adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3% based on a measure of the total exposure rather than total assets and new liquidity standards. The Basel III capital, leverage, and liquidity standards will be phased in over a multiyear period. The Basel III rules, when implemented, will also impose a 15% cap on the amount of Tier 1 capital that can be met, in the aggregate, through significant investments in the common shares of unconsolidated financial subsidiaries, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs), and deferred tax assets through timing differences, as well as a 10% cap on the amount of each of the three individual items that may be included in Tier 1 capital. In addition, under Basel III rules, after a 10-year phase-out period beginning in January 2013, trust preferred and other “hybrid” securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital. However, under the Dodd-Frank Act, subject to certain exceptions, trust preferred and other “hybrid” securities are phased out from Tier 1 capital in a three-year period starting January 2013. At December 31, 2011, Ally had $2.3 billion of MSRs and $2.5 billion of trust preferred securities, which were included as Tier 1 capital. Ally currently has no other “hybrid” securities outstanding. The Basel III 14Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Krules, when implemented, will impose limits on Ally's ability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through the use of MSRs, trust preferred securities, or other “hybrid” securities, if applicable. Pending final rules for Basel III and subsequent regulatory interpretation, there remains a degree of uncertainty on the full impact of Basel III. It is currently anticipated that U.S. banking regulators will propose regulations to implement Basel III in 2012.If we or Ally Bank fail to satisfy regulatory capital requirements, we or Ally Bank may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to informal or formal supervisory actions by the FRB and/or FDIC and, potentially, FDIC receivership of Ally Bank. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.The actions of the FRB and international central banking authorities directly impact our cost of funds for lending, capital raising, and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, such changes in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to predict.Future consumer or mortgage legislation could harm our competitive position.In addition to the recent enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, various legislative bodies have also recently been considering altering the existing framework governing creditors' rights and mortgage products including legislation that would result in or allow loan modifications of various sorts. Such legislation may change banking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business; limit or expand permissible activities; or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on our activities, financial condition, or results of operations.Ally and its subsidiaries are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, investigations, and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences.Ally and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews, investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the FRB, FDIC, Utah DFI, CFPB, SEC, and the Federal Trade Commission regarding their respective operations. Such requests include subpoenas from each of the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice, served on Ally Financial Inc. and GMAC Mortgage LLC, respectively.  Beginning in December 2010 and continuing through 2011, a series of subpoenas were received from the SEC, seeking information about various aspects of the process surrounding securitizations of residential mortgages with which certain of our mortgage subsidiaries were involved as sponsor or servicer. The subpoena received from the U.S. Department of Justice includes a broad request for documentation and other information in connection with its investigation of potential fraud related to the origination and/or underwriting of mortgage loans. These subpoenas, or any other investigation or information-gathering request, may result in material adverse consequences including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions.Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the impact of affiliate transaction restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions.Certain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank “affiliates,” including but not limited to Ally Financial Inc. and ResCap are subject to federal statutory and regulatory restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, “covered transactions,” including Ally Bank's extensions of credit to and asset purchases from its nonbank affiliates, generally (1) are limited to 10% of Ally Bank's capital stock and surplus with respect to transactions with any individual affiliate, with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Bank's capital stock and surplus for all affiliates and all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credit transactions, are subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a “low quality asset” under federal banking guidelines; and (4) must be conducted in accordance with safe-and-sound banking practices (collectively, the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, among other changes to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, credit exposures resulting from derivatives transactions and securities lending and borrowing transactions will be treated as “covered transactions.” Furthermore, there is an “attribution rule” that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party must be treated as a transaction between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, a nonbank affiliate of Ally Bank. Retail financing transactions by Ally Bank involving vehicles which are floorplan financed by Ally Financial Inc. are subject to the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions because the proceeds of the retail financings are deemed to benefit, and are ultimately transferred to, Ally.Historically, the FRB was authorized to exempt, in its discretion, transactions or relationships from the requirements of these rules if it found such exemptions to be in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the rules. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, exemptions now may be granted by the FDIC if the FDIC and FRB jointly find that the exemption is in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the rules, and the FDIC finds that the exemption does not present an unacceptable risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FRB granted several such exemptions to Ally Bank in the past. However, the existing exemptions are subject to various conditions and, particularly in light of the statutory changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, any requests for future exemptions may not be granted. Moreover, these limited exemptions generally do not encompass consumer leasing or used vehicle financing. Since there is no assurance that Ally Bank will be able to obtain future exemptions or waivers with respect to these restrictions, the ability to grow Ally Bank's business will be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions and the conditions set forth in the existing exemption letters. 15Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KAlly Financial Inc. may in the future require distributions from its subsidiaries.We currently fund Ally Financial Inc.'s obligations, including dividend payments to our preferred shareholders, and payments of interest and principal on our indebtedness, from cash generated by Ally Financial Inc. In the future, Ally Financial Inc. may not generate sufficient funds at the parent company level to fund its obligations. As such, it may require dividends, distributions, or other payments from its subsidiaries to fund its obligations. However, regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit the ability of Ally Financial Inc.'s subsidiaries to transfer funds freely to Ally Financial Inc. In particular, many of Ally Financial Inc.'s subsidiaries are subject to laws, regulations, and rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to it or that prohibit such transfers entirely in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations, and rules may hinder Ally Financial Inc.'s ability to access funds that it may need to make payments on its obligations in the future. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, Ally Financial Inc. may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on its ability to pay dividends. The bank regulators have the authority and, under certain circumstances, the duty to prohibit or to limit payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ally Financial Inc. and its subsidiaries.Current and future increases in FDIC insurance premiums, including the FDIC special assessment imposed on all FDIC-insured institutions, could decrease our earnings.Beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2011, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the Deposit Insurance Fund (the DIF). In May 2009, the FDIC announced that it had voted to levy a special assessment on insured institutions in order to facilitate the rebuilding of the DIF. In September 2009, the FDIC voted to adopt an increase in the risk-based assessment rate effective beginning January 1, 2011, by three basis points. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act alters the calculation of an insured institution's deposit base for purposes of deposit insurance assessments and removes the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing these changes, which took effect on April 1, 2011. The FDIC will continue to assess the changes to the assessment rates at least annually. Future deposit premiums paid by Ally Bank depend on the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. Any increases in deposit insurance assessments could decrease our earnings.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe profitability and financial condition of our operations are heavily dependent upon the performance, operations, and prospects of GM and Chrysler.GM, GM dealers, and GM-related employees compose a significant portion of our customer base, and our domestic and, in particular, our International Automotive Finance operations are highly dependent on GM production and sales volume. In 2011, 62% of our North American new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 66% of our North American new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for GM dealers and customers. In addition, 97% of our international new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 82% of our international new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for GM dealers and customers. Furthermore, we have an agreement with Chrysler related to automotive financing products and services for Chrysler dealers and customers pursuant to which we are the preferred provider of new wholesale financing for Chrysler dealer inventory and consumer financing for Chrysler customers. In 2011, 30% of our North American new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 28% of our North American new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for Chrysler dealers and customers.Ally's agreements with GM and Chrysler regarding automotive financing products for their dealers and customers extend through December and April 2013, respectively, unless terminated earlier in accordance with their terms. The agreement with Chrysler provides for automatic one-year renewals unless either we or Chrysler provides sufficient notice of nonrenewal. As a result, our agreement with Chrysler will be automatically extended through April 30, 2014, unless Chrysler notifies us of nonrenewal on or before April 30, 2012, in which case, the agreement would expire on April 30, 2013. These agreements provide Ally with certain preferred provider benefits including limiting the use of other financing providers by GM and Chrysler in their incentive programs. The terms of the Ally agreement with GM changed after January 1, 2011, such that GM is now able to offer incrementally more incentive programs through third parties on a nonexclusive, side-by-side basis with Ally, provided that the pricing of the third parties meets certain requirements. Due to the highly competitive nature of the market for financial services, Ally may be unable to extend one or both of these agreements or may face less favorable terms upon extension. If Ally is unable to extend one or both of these agreements or if GM or Chrysler enters a similar agreement with a third party, Ally's retail financing volumes could be materially and adversely impacted.On October 1, 2010, GM acquired AmeriCredit Corp. (which GM subsequently renamed General Motors Financial Company, Inc.), an independent automotive finance company that focuses on providing leasing and subprime financing options. If GM were to direct substantially more business, including wholesale financing business, to its captive on noncommercial terms thus reducing its reliance on our services over time, it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. In addition, it is possible that GM or other automotive manufacturers could utilize other existing companies to support their financing needs including offering products or terms that we would not or could not offer, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. Furthermore, other automotive manufacturers could expand or establish or acquire captive finance companies to support their financing needs thus reducing their need for our services.A significant adverse change in GM's or Chrysler's business, including significant adverse changes in their respective liquidity position and access to the capital markets; the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the use of GM or Chrysler marketing incentives; GM's or Chrysler's relationships with its key suppliers; or GM's or Chrysler's relationship 16Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kwith the United Auto Workers and other labor unions and other factors impacting GM or Chrysler or their respective employees, could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. In addition, growth in our International Automotive Finance operations are highly dependent on GM, and therefore any significant change to GM's international business or our relationship with GM may hinder our ability to expand internationally.There is no assurance that the global automotive market or GM's and Chrysler's respective share of that market will not suffer downturns in the future, and any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capital positions, and financial condition.Our liquidity and the long-term viability of Ally depend on many factors, including our ability to successfully raise capital and secure appropriate bank financing. We are currently required to maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 15% at Ally Bank, which will require that Ally maintain substantial equity funds in Ally Bank and inject substantial additional equity funds into Ally Bank as Ally Bank's assets increase over time.We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding, it continues to remain a critical component of our capital structure and financing plans. At December 31, 2011, approximately $12.0 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2012, which includes $7.4 billion in principal amount of debt issued under the FDIC's Temporary Liquidity Guaranty Program, and approximately $2.3 billion and $5.8 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2013 and 2014, respectively. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2011, a total of $2.8 billion in principal amount of Demand Notes were outstanding. We also rely on secured funding. At December 31, 2011, approximately $14.4 billion of outstanding consolidated secured debt is scheduled to mature in 2012, approximately $15.1 billion is scheduled to mature in 2013, and approximately $11.1 billion is scheduled to mature in 2014. Furthermore, at December 31, 2011, approximately $15.0 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2012, which is not included in the 2012 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a material portion of the debt maturities over these periods. The capital markets continue to be volatile, and Ally's access to the debt markets may be significantly reduced during periods of market stress. In addition, we will continue to have significant original issue discount amortization expenses (OID expense) in the near future, which will adversely affect our net income and resulting capital position. OID expense was $925 million for the year ended 2011, and the remaining scheduled amortization of OID is $350 million, $263 million, and $190 million in 2012, 2013, and 2014, respectively.As a result of the volatility in the markets and our current unsecured debt ratings, we have increased our reliance on various secured debt markets. Although market conditions have improved, there can be no assurances that this will continue. In addition, we continue to rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions and a tightening of credit availability could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and increase the costs of bank funding. Ally and Ally Bank also continue to access the securitization markets. While markets have continued to stabilize following the 2008 liquidity crisis, there can be no assurances these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could materially and adversely affect our business.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $101.6 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $53.0 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 57% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2011. In addition, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2011, we declared and paid preferred stock dividends of $794 million in the aggregate.We have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.The worldwide financial services industry is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully or if there is increased competition in the automotive financing, mortgage, and/or insurance markets or generally in the markets for securitizations or asset sales, our business could be negatively affected.The markets for automotive and mortgage financing, banking, and insurance are highly competitive. The market for automotive financing has grown more competitive as more consumers are financing their vehicle purchases and as more competitors continue to enter this market as a result of how well automotive finance assets generally performed relative to other asset classes during the 2008 economic downturn.  More recently, competition for automotive financing has further intensified as a growing number of banks have become increasingly interested in automotive-finance assets, which has resulted in pressure on our net interest margins. For example, on April 1, 2011, TD Bank Group announced the closing of its acquisition of Chrysler Financial, which could enhance Chrysler Financial's ability to expand its product offerings and may result in increased competition. Our mortgage business and Ally Bank face significant competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage companies, and other financial institutions. Our insurance business faces significant 17Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kcompetition from insurance carriers, reinsurers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, substantially lower costs of capital, and are much less reliant on securitization activities, unsecured debt, and other public markets. We face significant competition in most areas including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our profitability and financial condition could be negatively affected.The markets for asset and mortgage securitizations and whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In addition, lenders and other investors within those markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers, originators, and asset classes, or they may require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased issuance by other participants in the market or decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure to (or to require a higher yield for) us or to automotive or mortgage securitizations or whole-loans could negatively affect our ability and that of our subsidiaries to price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us.Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we may be required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents management's best estimate of probable credit losses that have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans, all as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existing qualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.Bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. An increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations.The protracted period of adverse developments in the mortgage finance and credit markets has adversely affected ResCap's business, liquidity, and its capital position and has raised substantial doubt about ResCap's ability to continue as a going concern.ResCap has been adversely affected by the events and conditions in the broader mortgage banking industry, most severely but not limited to the domestic nonprime and nonconforming and international mortgage loan markets. Fair market valuations of held-for-sale mortgage loans, MSRs, and securitized interests that continue to be held by ResCap and other assets and liabilities ResCap records at fair value may continue to deteriorate if there continues to be weakness in housing prices or increased severity of delinquencies and defaults of mortgage loans, or should mortgage rates increase. These deteriorating factors previously resulted in higher provision for loan losses on ResCap's held-for-investment mortgage loans and real estate-lending portfolios. As a direct result of these events and conditions, ResCap discontinued new originations in all of its international operations and sold its U.K. and European operations and currently generally only purchases or originates mortgage loans that can be sold in the form of securitizations guaranteed by the GSEs. If the GSEs became unable or unwilling to purchase mortgage loans from ResCap, it would have a materially adverse impact on ResCap's funding and liquidity and on its ability to originate or purchase new mortgage loans.ResCap is highly leveraged relative to its cash flow and has recognized substantial losses resulting in a significant deterioration in capital. There continues to be a risk that ResCap will not be able to meet its debt service obligations, and/or that it will be in a negative liquidity position in 2012 or beyond. Further, ResCap was in default on certain of its financial covenants as of December 31, 2011 due to insufficient equity levels, and it is possible that further defaults could occur in the future due to insufficient equity, capital, or liquidity. ResCap remains heavily dependent on Ally and its affiliates for funding and capital support, and there can be no assurance that Ally or its affiliates will continue any such support or that Ally will choose to execute any further strategic transactions with respect to ResCap or that any transactions undertaken will be successful.In light of ResCap's liquidity and capital needs combined with volatile conditions in the marketplace, there is substantial doubt about ResCap's ability to continue as a going concern. If Ally determines to no longer support ResCap's capital or liquidity needs or if ResCap or Ally are unable to successfully execute effective initiatives, it would have a material adverse effect on ResCap's business, results of operations, and financial position.We have extensive financing and hedging exposures to ResCap, which could be at risk of nonpayment if ResCap were to file for bankruptcy.We have extensive financing and hedging arrangements in place with ResCap. At December 31, 2011, we had $2.6 billion in funding arrangements with ResCap. This amount included a $1.0 billion of senior secured credit facilities, which were fully drawn at December 31, 2011. This amount further included a $1.6 billion line of credit consisting of $1.1 billion in secured capacity, of which $235 million was drawn, and $500 million of unsecured capacity. The unsecured portion is only available after the secured portion has been fully drawn. At 18Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KDecember 31, 2011, all hedging arrangements were fully collateralized. Amounts outstanding under the financing and hedging arrangements fluctuate. If ResCap were to file for bankruptcy, ResCap's repayments of its financing facilities, including those with us, will be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and regulations, or ResCap may be unable to repay its financing facilities. In addition, we would be an unsecured creditor of ResCap to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of our collateral are insufficient to repay ResCap's secured obligations to us. In addition, it is possible that other ResCap creditors would seek to recharacterize our loans to ResCap as equity contributions or to seek equitable subordination of our claims so that the claims of other creditors would have priority over our claims. We may also find it advantageous to provide debtor-in-possession financing to ResCap in a bankruptcy proceeding in order to preserve the value of the collateral ResCap has pledged to us. In addition, should ResCap file for bankruptcy, our investment related to ResCap's equity position would likely be reduced to zero, and creditors of ResCap may attempt to assert claims directly against us for payment of their obligations, which could result in litigation with such creditors.There is a significant risk that ResCap will not be able to meet its debt service obligations and other funding obligations in the near term.ResCap expects its liquidity pressures to continue in 2012. ResCap is highly leveraged relative to its cash flow. At December 31, 2011, ResCap's unrestricted liquidity (cash readily available to cover operating demands from across its business operations) totaled $390 million with cash and cash equivalents totaling $619 million.ResCap expects that additional and continuing liquidity pressure, which is difficult to forecast with precision, will result from the obligation of its subsidiaries to advance delinquent principal, interest, property taxes, casualty insurance premiums, home equity line advances, and certain other amounts with respect to mortgage loans its subsidiaries service that become delinquent. In addition, ResCap continues to be subject to financial covenants requiring it to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth and consolidated liquidity balances. ResCap will attempt to meet these and other liquidity and capital demands through a combination of cash flow from operations and financings, potential asset sales, and other various alternatives. To the extent these sources prove insufficient, ResCap will be dependent on continued support from Ally to the extent Ally agrees to provide such support. Ally currently provides funding and capital support to ResCap through various secured and unsecured facilities, which includes a $500 million unsecured line of credit. The sufficiency of these sources of additional liquidity cannot be assured, and any asset sales, even if they raise sufficient cash to meet ResCap's liquidity needs, may adversely affect its overall profitability and financial condition.Moreover, even if ResCap is successful in implementing all of the actions described above, its ability to satisfy its liquidity needs and comply with any covenants included in its debt agreements requiring maintenance of minimum cash balances may be affected by additional factors and events (such as interest rate fluctuations and margin calls) that increase ResCap's cash needs making ResCap unable to independently satisfy its near-term liquidity requirements.Our mortgage subsidiary, ResCap, requires substantial liquidity and capital.ResCap remains heavily reliant on support from us to meet its liquidity and capital requirements, which includes approximately $2.4 billion in principal amount of indebtedness scheduled to mature in 2012, 2013, and 2014. For example, we made a capital contribution of approximately $197 million to ResCap in January 2012 through forgiveness of intercompany debt to cure a covenant breach by ResCap. In addition, ResCap has commitments to lend up to $1.8 billion under existing home equity lines of credit it has extended to customers. Developments in the market for many types of mortgage products have resulted in reduced liquidity for these assets. As a result, a significant portion of ResCap's assets are relatively illiquid.Pursuant to an existing contractual arrangement, ResCap is precluded from paying any dividends to us, including additional capital that we may provide in the future.ResCap employs various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of its assets including its mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio, MSRs, its portfolio of held-for-investment mortgage loans, and interests from securitizations. A significant portion of ResCap's operating cash at any given time may consist of funds delivered to it as credit support by counterparties pursuant to these arrangements. As interest rates change and dependent upon the hedge position, ResCap may need to continue to repay or deliver cash as credit support for these arrangements. If the amount ResCap must repay or deliver is substantial, depending on its liquidity position at that time, ResCap may not be able to pay such amounts as required.Certain of our mortgage subsidiaries have been, and will likely continue to be, required to repurchase mortgage loans for losses, indemnify the investor for incurred losses, or make the investor whole related to breaches of representations and warranties made in connection with the sale of loans, and face potential legal liability resulting from claims related to the sale of mortgage backed securities.When our Mortgage Companies sell mortgage loans through whole-loan sales or securitizations, these entities are required to make customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser and/or securitization trust. These representations and warranties relate to, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing the loan, the loan's compliance with the criteria for inclusion in the transaction, including compliance with underwriting standards or loan criteria established by the buyer, ability to deliver required documentation, and compliance with applicable laws. In general, the representations and warranties described above may be enforced against the applicable Mortgage Companies at any time unless a sunset provision is in place. Breaches of these representations and warranties have resulted in a requirement that the applicable Mortgage Companies repurchase mortgage loans, indemnify the investor for incurred losses, or make the investor whole. As the mortgage industry continues to experience higher repurchase demands and additional 19Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kparties begin to attempt to put back loans, a significant increase in activity beyond that experienced today could occur, resulting in additional future losses at our Mortgage Companies. At December 31, 2011, our reserve for representation and warranty obligations was $825 million. It is difficult to determine the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions used to determine this reserve. For example, if the law were to develop that disagrees with our interpretation that a claimant must prove that the alleged breach of representations and warranties was caused by the alleged adverse effect on the interest of the claimant, it could significantly impact our determination of the reserve. In addition, if recent court rulings related to monoline litigation that have allowed sampling of loan files instead of a loan-by-loan review to determine if a representations and warranties breach has occurred are followed generally by the courts, private-label securitization investors may view litigation as a more attractive alternative to a loan-by-loan review. As a result of these and other developments, the actual experience at our Mortgage Companies may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details.Further, claims related to private-label mortgage-backed securities (MBS) have been brought against Ally and certain of its subsidiaries under federal and state securities laws and contract laws (among other theories), and additional similar claims are likely to be brought in the future. Several securities law cases have been brought by various third-party investors relating to MBS, where investors have alleged misstatements and omissions in registration statements, prospectuses, prospectus supplements, and other documents related to MBS offerings. In addition, there are two cases pending where MBIA Insurance Corporation (MBIA), a monoline bond insurance company, has alleged, among other things, that two of our Mortgage Companies breached their contractual representations and warranties relating to the characteristics of the mortgage loans contained in certain insured MBS offerings. MBIA further alleges that such entities failed to follow certain remedy procedures set forth in the contracts and improperly serviced the mortgage loans. Along with claims of breach of contract, MBIA also alleges fraud. In addition, there are four cases where Financial Guaranty Insurance Company (FGIC) has alleged, among other things, that certain of our mortgage subsidiaries breached their contractual representations and warranties relating to the characteristics of the mortgage loans contained in certain insured MBS offerings. FGIC further alleges that our subsidiaries breached contractual obligations to permit access to loan files and certain books and records. Along with claims of breach of contract, FGIC also alleges fraud in one of the three cases. We expect our Mortgage Companies to receive additional repurchase demands from MBIA and FGIC, the amount of which could be substantial. In addition, litigation from other monoline bond insurance companies is likely. Third-party investors may also bring contractual representation and warranties claims against us. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further details with respect to existing litigation.Certain of our mortgage subsidiaries received subpoenas in July 2010 from the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), which is the conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The subpoenas relating to Fannie Mae investments have been withdrawn with prejudice. The FHFA indicated that documents provided in response to the remaining subpoenas will enable the FHFA to determine whether they believe issuers of private-label MBS are potentially liable to Freddie Mac for losses they might have incurred. Although Freddie Mac has not brought any representation and warranty claims against us with respect to private label securities subsequent to the settlement, they may well do so in the future. The FHFA has commenced securities and related common law fraud litigation against certain of our mortgage subsidiaries with respect to certain of Freddie Mac's private label securities investments. Refer to Note 31 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.We believe it is reasonably possible that losses at our Mortgage Companies beyond amounts currently reserved for the matters described above could occur, and such losses could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. However, based on currently available information, we are unable to estimate a range of reasonably possible losses above reserves that have been established.Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs, restrictions on our access to such programs, or disruptions in the secondary markets in the United States or in other countries in which we operate could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.Our ability to generate revenue through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors in the United States depends to a significant degree on programs administered by the GSEs and others that facilitate the issuance of MBS in the secondary market. These GSEs play a powerful role in the residential mortgage industry and we have significant business relationships with them. Proposals have been enacted in the U.S. Congress and are under consideration by various regulatory authorities that would affect the manner in which these GSEs conduct their business to require them to register their stock with the SEC to reduce or limit certain business benefits that they receive from the U.S. government and to limit the size of the mortgage loan portfolios that they may hold. Furthermore, the Obama administration released a report in 2011 that recommended winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We do not know what impact, if any, the report would have on the future of the GSEs. Moreover, the results of the upcoming U.S. presidential election may also have a significant impact on the future of the GSEs. In addition, the GSEs themselves have been negatively affected by recent mortgage market conditions, including conditions that have threatened their access to debt financing. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these GSEs could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Also, any significant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary market including declines in institutional investors' desire to invest in our mortgage products could materially adversely affect our business.We are exposed to consumer credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition.We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. For example, the continued decline in the domestic housing market and the increase in unemployment rates resulted in an increase in delinquency rates related to mortgage loans that ResCap and Ally 20Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KBank either hold or retain an interest in. Furthermore, a weak economic environment, high unemployment rates, and the continued deterioration of the housing market could exert pressure on our consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions, and losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies, and loss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent a further adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we have begun to increase our used automobile and nonprime automobile financing (nonprime automobile financing). We define nonprime consumer automobile loans as those loans with a FICO score (or an equivalent score) at origination of less than 620. At December 31, 2011, the carrying value of our North American Automotive Finance Operations (NAO) nonprime consumer automobile loans before allowance for loan losses was $3.8 billion, or approximately 7.1% of our total NAO consumer automobile loans. Of these loans, $51 million were considered nonperforming as they had been placed on nonaccrual status in accordance with internal loan policies. Refer to the Nonaccrual Loans section of Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Our International Automotive Finance Operations (IO) also has exposure to loans of higher credit risk with similar characteristics to those of the nonprime loans held by NAO. However, the lack of a consistent external third-party provider of consumer credit score information (like FICO in the United States and Canada) across the international geographies where we operate requires us to use our own internally-developed credit scoring approach to create a similar international comparative. Based on this internal analysis we believe nonprime loans represent less than 10% of our total IO consumer automobile loans and of these loans, less than 5% were considered nonperforming. As we grow our automotive asset portfolio in nonprime automobile financing loans over time, our credit risk may increase. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased.General business and economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States and in the markets in which we operate outside the United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased short and long term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the debt capital markets, unemployment rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or a decline in the strength of national and local economies and other factors that negatively affect household incomes could decrease demand for our financing and mortgage products and increase mortgage and financing delinquency and losses on our customer and dealer financing operations. We have been negatively affected due to the significant stress in the residential real estate and related capital markets and, in particular, the lack of home price appreciation in many markets in which we lend. Further, a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices could lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases and negatively affect our automotive finance business.If the rate of inflation were to increase, or if the debt capital markets or the economies of the United States or our markets outside the United States were to weaken, or if home prices or new and used vehicle purchases experience declines, we could be significantly and adversely affected, and it could become more expensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to our businesses could decrease (1) the demand for our mortgage loans and new and used vehicle financing and (2) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio of held-for-investment mortgages and new and used vehicle loans and interests that continue to be held by us, thus further increasing the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans. In addition, the rate of delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses on our loans (especially our nonprime mortgage loans) could be higher during more severe economic slowdowns.Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses could further harm our ability to sell our mortgage and new and used vehicle loans, the prices we receive for our mortgage and new and used vehicle loans, or the value of our portfolio of mortgage and new and used vehicle loans held-for-investment or interests from our securitizations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Continued adverse business and economic conditions could affect demand for housing, new and used vehicles, the cost of construction, and other related factors that could harm the revenues and profitability of our business.In addition, our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies and similar governmental authorities in the markets in which we operate outside the United States. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. The FRB's policies influence the new and used vehicle financing market and the size of the mortgage origination market, which significantly affects the earnings of our businesses and the earnings of our business capital activities. The FRB's policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.The current debt crisis in Europe, the risk that certain countries may default on their sovereign debt, and recent rating agency actions with respect to European countries and the United States and the resulting impact on the financial markets, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial position.The current crisis in Europe has created uncertainty with respect to the ability of certain European Union countries to continue to service their sovereign debt obligations. Recently, rating agencies have lowered their ratings on several euro-zone countries. The continuation of the European debt crisis has adversely impacted financial markets and has created substantial volatility and uncertainty, and will likely continue to do so. Risks related to this have had, and are likely to continue to have, a negative impact on global economic activity and the financial markets. In addition, on August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its long-term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America to 'AA+' from 'AAA', and the outlook on its long-term rating is negative. The U.S. downgrade, any future 21Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kdowngrades, as well as the perceived creditworthiness of U.S. government-related obligations, could impact our ability to obtain, and the pricing with respect to, funding that is collateralized by affected instruments and obtained through the secured and unsecured markets. As these conditions persist, our business, results of operation, and financial position could be materially adversely affected.Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.Geopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.The U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) holds a majority of the outstanding our common stock.At February 28, 2012, Treasury held 981,971 shares of common stock, which represents approximately 74% of the voting power of the holders of common stock outstanding for matters requiring a vote of the holders of common stock. In addition, as of the date hereof, Treasury holds 118,750,000 shares of Series F-2 Preferred Stock (which are convertible into shares of common stock in accordance with Ally's certificate of incorporation), with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately $5.9 billion.Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Governance Agreement dated May 21, 2009, as of the date hereof, Treasury also has the right to appoint six of the eleven members to our board of directors. As a result of this stock ownership interest and Treasury's right to appoint six directors to our board of directors, Treasury has the ability to exert control, through its power to vote for the election of our directors, over various matters. To the extent Treasury elects to exert such control over us, its interests (as a government entity) may differ from those of our other stockholders and it may influence, through its ability to vote for the election of our directors, matters including:•The selection, tenure and compensation of our management;•Our business strategy and product offerings;•Our relationship with our employees and other constituencies; and•Our financing activities, including the issuance of debt and equity securities.In particular, Treasury may have a greater interest in promoting U.S. economic growth and jobs than our other stockholders. In the future we may also become subject to new and additional laws and government regulations regarding various aspects of our business as a result of participation in the TARP program and the U.S. government's ownership in our business. These regulations could make it more difficult for us to compete with other companies that are not subject to similar regulations.The limitations on compensation imposed on us due to our participation in TARP, including the restrictions placed on our compensation by the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, may adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate our executives and employees.Our performance is dependent on the talent and efforts of our management team and employees. As a result of our participation in TARP, the compensation of certain members of our management team and employees is subject to extensive restrictions under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the ARRA), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, as implemented by the Interim Final Rule issued by Treasury on June 15, 2009 (the IFR). In addition, due to our level of participation in TARP, pursuant to ARRA and the IFR, the Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation has the authority to further regulate our compensation arrangements with certain of our executives and employees. In addition, we may become subject to further restrictions under any other future legislation or regulation limiting executive compensation. Many of the restrictions are not limited to our senior executives and affect other employees whose contributions to revenue and performance may be significant. These limitations may leave us unable to create a compensation structure that permits us to retain and motivate certain of our executives and employees or to attract new executives or employees, especially if we are competing against institutions that are not subject to the same restrictions. Any such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings.The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poor's Rating Services; Moody's Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates our debt. Our current ratings as assigned by each of the respective rating agencies are below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the unsecured market. Ratings reflect the rating agencies' opinions of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. On February 2, 2012, Fitch downgraded our senior debt to BB- from BB and changed the outlook to negative. Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing costs and further constrain our access to the unsecured debt markets and, as a result, would negatively affect our business. In addition, downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as impact elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements.Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization. Each agency's rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency's rating.22Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KOur profitability and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if the residual value of off-lease vehicles decrease in the future.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination, is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we incur additional depreciation expense and/or a loss on the lease transaction. General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease and other vehicles to be sold, new vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price and volatility of gasoline or diesel fuel, among other factors, heavily influence used vehicle prices and thus the actual residual value of off-lease vehicles. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of automotive manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during 2008, sharp declines in demand and used vehicle sale prices adversely affected our remarketing proceeds and financial results.Vehicle brand images, consumer preference, and vehicle manufacturer marketing programs that influence new and used vehicle markets also influence lease residual values. In addition, our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and proceeds realized from the vehicle sales. While manufacturers, at times, may provide support for lease residual values including through residual support programs, this support does not in all cases entitle us to full reimbursement for the difference between the remarketing sales proceeds for off-lease vehicles and the residual value specified in the lease contract. Differences between the actual residual values realized on leased vehicles and our expectations of such values at contract inception could have a negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.Current conditions in the residential mortgage market and housing markets may continue to adversely affect Ally's mortgage business.The residential mortgage market in the United States and other international markets in which our Mortgage operations conduct, or previously conducted, business have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions that adversely affected our mortgage business' results of operations and financial condition. Delinquencies and losses with respect to our Legacy Portfolio and Other segment's nonprime mortgage loans increased significantly. Housing prices in many parts of the United States, the United Kingdom, and other international markets also declined or stopped appreciating after extended periods of significant appreciation. In addition, the liquidity provided to the mortgage sector had been significantly reduced. This liquidity reduction combined with our decision to reduce our mortgage business' exposure to the nonprime mortgage market caused its nonprime mortgage production to decline. Similar trends have emerged beyond the nonprime sector, especially at the lower end of the prime credit quality scale, and have had a similar effect on our mortgage business' related liquidity needs and businesses. These trends have resulted in significant write-downs to our Legacy Portfolio and Other's held-for-sale mortgage loans and trading securities portfolios and additions to its allowance for loan losses for its held-for-investment mortgage loans and warehouse-lending receivables portfolios. A continuation of these conditions may continue to adversely affect our mortgage business' financial condition and results of operations.Moreover, the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market and decline in home prices since 2008 in many U.S. markets, which may continue, could result in increased delinquencies or defaults on the mortgage assets ResCap owns and services as well as those mortgage assets owned by Ally Bank. Further, loans that our Mortgage operations historically made based on limited credit or income documentation also increase the likelihood of future increases in delinquencies or defaults on mortgage loans. An increase in delinquencies or defaults will result in a higher level of credit losses and credit-related expenses and increased liquidity requirements to fund servicing advances, all of which in turn will reduce revenues and profits of our mortgage business. Higher credit losses and credit-related expenses also could adversely affect our financial condition.Significant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or loan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases or mortgage loans could harm our profitability and financial condition.We have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive receivable or mortgage loan, the servicer may be required by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets or other payments occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the result could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.In connection with its servicing of securitized mortgage loans, ResCap is subject to contractual caps on the percentage of mortgage loans it is permitted to modify in any securitized pool. The financial crisis has resulted in dramatic increases in the volume of delinquent mortgage loans over the past three years. In an effort to achieve the best net present value recovery for the securitization trust, ResCap increased the volume of modifications of distressed mortgage loans to assist homeowners and avoid liquidating properties in a collapsing and opaque housing market. In certain securitization transactions, ResCap has exceeded the applicable contractual modification cap. The securitization documents provide that the contractual caps can be raised or eliminated with the concurrence of each rating agency rating the transaction. For certain transactions with respect to which loan modifications have exceeded the contractual caps, the rating agencies have concurred in raising or eliminating the caps, but they have not consented in connection with other such transactions. ResCap will continue to seek their concurrence in connection with other transactions as it deems appropriate and will suspend modifications in excess of applicable caps pending receipt of such consent or investor approval to amend the servicing contracts. An investor in a specific mortgage security class might claim that modifications in excess of the applicable cap amounted to a material failure of ResCap to perform its servicing obligations and that the investor was damaged as a result. Such claims, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, 23Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kliquidity, and results of operations.Our earnings may decrease because of decreases or increases in interest rates.We are subject to risks from decreasing interest rates, particularly given the Federal Reserve's recent steps to keep interest rates low in an attempt to improve economic growth. For example, a significant decrease in interest rates could increase the rate at which mortgages are prepaid, which could require us to write down the value of our retained interests and MSRs. Moreover, if prepayments are greater than expected, the cash we receive over the life of our held-for-investment mortgage loans and our retained interests would be reduced. Higher-than-expected prepayments could also reduce the value of our MSRs and, to the extent the borrower does not refinance with us, the size of our servicing portfolio. Therefore, any such changes in interest rates could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Rising interest rates could also have an adverse impact on our business. For example, rising interest rates:•will increase our cost of funds;•may reduce our consumer automotive financing volume by influencing customers to pay cash for, as opposed to financing, vehicle purchases or not to buy new vehicles;•may negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease vehicles;•generally reduce our residential mortgage loan production as borrowers become less likely to refinance and the costs associated with acquiring a new home become more expensive; and•will generally reduce the value of mortgage and automotive financing loans and contracts and retained interests and fixed income securities held in our investment portfolio.Throughout 2009 and 2010 the credit risk embedded in the balance sheet was reduced as a result of asset sales, asset markdowns, and a change in the mix of our loan assets as the legacy portfolios were replaced with assets underwritten to tighter credit standards. This reduction in risk has resulted in a mix of assets outstanding on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2011, with a lower yielding profile than the prior-year period. During this same period of time we experienced a significant decline in our consumer automotive operating lease portfolio that was realizing higher yields from remarketing gains due to historically high used vehicle prices. The combination of the above factors resulted in a decline in asset yields more than the decline in liability rates, and therefore the decline in the net interest spread on the balance sheet throughout 2010 and into 2011.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could affect our profitability and financial condition as could our failure to comply with hedge accounting principles and interpretations.We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we may not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the application of significant subjective judgments to a body of accounting concepts that is complex and for which the interpretations have continued to evolve within the accounting profession and among the standard-setting bodies.A failure of or interruption in, as well as, security risks of the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely as a result of inadequate or failed processes or systems, human errors, or external events could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer applications being received, slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in servicing. In addition, our communication and information systems may present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of our assets in determining lease residual values and in determining our reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including certain held-for-investment and held-for-sale loans for which we elected fair value accounting, retained interests from securitizations of loans and contracts, MSRs, and other investments, which do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not 24Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-Kreported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements. For further discussion related to estimates and assumptions, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Estimates. It is difficult to determine the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, and our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. A material difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects.Our business outside the United States exposes us to additional risks that may cause our revenues and profitability to decline.We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States exposing us to risks such as the following:•multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change;•differing local product preferences and product requirements;•fluctuations in foreign interest rates;•difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing foreign operations;•differing labor regulations;•consequences from changes in tax laws;•restrictions on our ability to repatriate profits or transfer cash into or out of foreign countries; and•political and economic instability, natural calamities, war, and terrorism.The effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Our business could be adversely affected by changes in foreign-currency exchange rates.We are exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign-currency exchange rates. Changes in currency exchange rates can have a significant impact on our earnings from international operations as a result of foreign-currency-translation adjustments. While we carefully monitor and attempt to manage our exposure to fluctuation in currency exchange rates through foreign-currency hedging activities, these types of changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Fluctuations in valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues.Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation. Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value and could negatively affect our revenues. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available-for-sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, national and international events, and general market conditions.A loss of contractual servicing rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.We are the servicer for all of the receivables we have acquired or originated and transferred to other parties in securitizations and whole-loan sales of automotive receivables. Our mortgage subsidiaries service the mortgage loans we have securitized, and we service the majority of the mortgage loans we have sold in whole-loan sales. In each case, we are paid a fee for our services, which fees in the aggregate constitute a substantial revenue stream for us. In each case, we are subject to the risk of termination under the circumstances specified in the applicable servicing provisions.In most securitizations and whole-loan sales, the owner of the receivables or mortgage loans will be entitled to declare a servicer default and terminate the servicer upon the occurrence of specified events. These events typically include a bankruptcy of the servicer, a material failure by the servicer to perform its obligations, and a failure by the servicer to turn over funds on the required basis. The termination of these servicing rights, were it to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations and those of our mortgage subsidiaries.Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC, banking regulators, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changes could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.25Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc. • Form 10-KRecently, the FASB has proposed new financial accounting standards, and has many active projects underway, that could materially affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition. These proposed standards or projects include the potential for significant changes in the accounting for financial instruments (including loans, deposits, and debt) and the accounting for leases, among others. It is possible that any changes, if enacted, could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposure to different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty.Our inability to maintain relationships with dealers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.Our business depends on the continuation of our relationships with our customers, particularly the automotive dealers with whom we do business. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with key automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason, including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis or offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in states in which we have customer concentrations may negatively affect our operating results and financial condition.We are exposed to consumer loan portfolio concentration in California and Texas and consumer mortgage loan concentration in California, Florida, and Michigan. Factors adversely affecting the economies and applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position"
4,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2011-02-25,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  Ourbusinesses face many risks and uncertainties, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties that we face are describedbelow. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.  Risks Related to Regulation Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by regulations to which we are subject as aresult of our bank holding company status.  On December 24, 2008, the Board of Governors of the Federal ReserveSystem (the FRB) approved our application to become a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act). Many of the regulatory requirements to which we are subject as a bank holding company were notpreviously applicable to us and have and will continue to require significant expense and devotion of resources to fully implement processes that will be necessary to ensure compliance. Compliance with such laws and regulations involves substantialcosts and may adversely affect our ability to operate profitably. Recent events, particularly in the financial and real estate markets, have resulted in bank regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on participants in the financialservices industry, including us. For a description of our regulatory requirements, see Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 1. Business.  Ally is subject to ongoing supervision by the FRB, and Ally Bank by the FDIC and Utah Department of Financial Institutions (the Utah DFI), in each case, through regular examinations and other means thatallow the regulators to gauge managements ability to identify, assess, and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe-and-sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. As a result of Allys conversion to a bankholding company, Ally and Ally Bank have been required to implement policies and procedures and take other actions to improve their current processes and to seek to ensure adherence to applicable regulatory guidelines and standards.   12 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   Ally is currently required by its banking supervisors to make improvements in areas suchas board and senior management oversight, risk management, regulatory reporting, internal audit planning, capital adequacy process, stress testing, and Bank Secrecy Act / anti-money laundering compliance, and to continue to reduce problem assets.Separately, Ally Bank is currently required by its banking supervisors to make improvements in areas such as compliance management and training, consumer protection monitoring, consumer complaint resolution, internal audit program and residentialmortgage loan pricing, and fee monitoring. These requirements are judicially enforceable, and if we are unable to implement and maintain these required actions, plans, policies and procedures in a timely and effective manner and otherwise complywith the requirements outlined above, we could become subject to formal supervisory actions which could subject us to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to develop any new business. Such forms of supervisory actioncould include, without limitation, written agreements, cease and desist orders, and consent orders and may, among other things, result in restrictions on our ability to pay dividends, requirements to increase capital, restrictions on our activities,the imposition of civil monetary penalties, and enforcement of such action through injunctions or restraining orders. We could also be required to dispose of certain assets and liabilities within a prescribed period. The terms of any suchsupervisory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.  Our ability to engage in certain activities may be adversely affected by our status as a bank holding company.  As a bank holding company, Allys activities are generally limited to banking or to managing or controlling banks or other companies engaged in activities deemed closely related to banking orotherwise permissible under the BHC Act and related regulations. Likewise, Ally generally may not hold more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any company unless that companys activities conform with the above requirements. Upon our bankholding company approval, we were permitted an initial two-year grace period to bring our activities and investments into conformity with these restrictions. This initial grace period expired in December 2010; however, the FRB has granted a one-yearextension that expires in December 2011. We will be permitted to apply to the FRB for up to two additional one-year extensions. Certain of Allys existing activities and investments, including certain of our insurance activities and ourSmartAuction vehicle remarketing services, are deemed impermissible under the BHC Act and must be terminated or disposed of by the expiration of this extension and any additional extensions. While some of these activities may be continued if Ally isable to convert to a financial holding company under the BHC Act, Ally may be unable to satisfy the requirements to enable it to convert to a financial holding company prior to that time, and activities, businesses, or investments that would bepermissible for a financial holding company will need to be terminated or disposed of. The FRB may also decline to grant any additional requested extensions, and Ally may be obligated to terminate or dispose of any impermissible activities,businesses, or investments more quickly than anticipated or under terms less advantageous to Ally than expected. Either situation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. As a bank holding company, our ability to expand into new business activities requires us to obtain the prior approval of the relevantbanking supervisors. There can be no assurance that any required approval will be obtained or that we will be able to execute on these plans in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to obtain approval to expand into new business activities,our business, results of operations, and financial position may be materially adversely affected.  Our business andfinancial condition could be adversely affected as a result of issues relating to mortgage foreclosures, home sales, and evictions in certain states.  Representatives of federal and state governments, including the United States Department of Justice, the FRB, the FDIC, the SEC, and law enforcement authorities in all 50 states, have announcedinvestigations into the procedures followed by mortgage servicing companies and banks, including subsidiaries of Ally, in connection with mortgage foreclosure home sales and evictions. We are cooperating with these investigations. The result ofthese investigations is uncertain, but we expect that Ally or its subsidiaries will become subject to fines, penalties, sanctions or other adverse actions by one or more of these regulators. Any of these potential actions could have a materialadverse impact on us.  On September 17, 2010, GMAC Mortgage, LLC (GMACM), our indirect wholly owned subsidiary,temporarily suspended mortgage foreclosure home sales and evictions and postponed hearings on motions for judgment in certain states. This decision was made after an operational matter was detected in the execution of certain affidavits used inconnection with judicial foreclosures in some but not all states. The issue relates to whether persons signing the affidavits had appropriately verified the information in them and whether they were signed in the immediate physical presence of anotary. In response to   13 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   this and to enhance existing procedures, GMACM has recently implemented supplemental procedures that are used in all new foreclosure cases to seek to ensure that affidavits are prepared incompliance with applicable law. GMACM is also conducting an additional review of all foreclosure files in all states prior to proceeding with foreclosure sales.  Our review related to this matter is ongoing, and we cannot predict the ultimate impact of any deficiencies that have been or may be identified in our historical foreclosure procedures. However, thus farwe have not found any evidence of unwarranted foreclosures. There are potential risks related to these matters that extend beyond potential liability on individual foreclosure actions. Specific risks could include, for example, claims and litigationrelated to foreclosure file remediation and resubmission; claims from investors that hold securities that become adversely impacted by continued delays in the foreclosure process; actions by courts, state attorneys general, or regulators to delayfurther the foreclosure process after submission of corrected affidavits; regulatory fines, sanctions, and other additional costs; and reputational risks. If the magnitude of any negative impact related to the foregoing proves to be material, itcould have an adverse affect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.  Our ability to execute ourbusiness strategy may be affected by regulatory considerations.  Our business strategy for Ally Bank, which includesfurther expansion of both automotive and mortgage lending, is subject to regulatory oversight from a safety and soundness perspective. If our banking supervisors determine that any aspect of our business strategy for Ally Bank raises any safety andsoundness concerns, we may be obliged to alter our strategy, including by moving certain activities, such as certain types of lending, outside of Ally Bank to one of our nonbanking affiliates. Alternative funding sources outside of Ally Bank, suchas asset securitization or financings in the capital markets, could be more expensive than funding through Ally Bank and could adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition. Our ability to rely on deposits as a part of our funding strategy may be limited. Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our funding strategy, and we have increased our reliance on deposits as an alternative source offunding through Ally Bank. Ally Bank does not have a retail branch network, and it obtains its deposits through direct banking and brokered deposits (which, at December 31, 2010, included $10 billion of brokered certificates of deposit that maybe more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher interest rates). Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base could be affected byregulatory restrictions including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements, restrictions on deposit growth or restrictions on our rates offered. In addition, perceptions of our financial strength, rates offered by third parties, andother competitive factors beyond our control, including returns on alternative investments, will also impact our ability to grow our deposit base. Even if we are able to grow the deposit base of Ally Bank, our regulators may impose restrictions onour ability to use Ally Bank deposits as a source of funding for certain business activities potentially raising the cost of funding those activities without the use of Ally Bank deposits. The FDIC has indicated that it expects Ally to diversify Ally Banks overall funding and to focus on reducing Ally Banksoverall funding costs including the interest rates paid on Ally Bank deposits. Any such actions could limit Ally Banks ability to grow and maintain deposits, which could have a material adverse impact on the funding and capital position ofAlly.  The regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings. Our domestic operations are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing variousrequirements and restrictions relating to supervision and regulation by state and federal authorities. Such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers, not for the benefit of investors in our securities,and could limit our discretion in operating our business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue as well as the imposition of civilfines and criminal penalties.  Ally, Ally Bank, and many of our nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank and otherregulatory agencies at the federal and state levels. This regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors, the FDICs Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Changes to statutes, regulations,rules, or policies including the interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, rules, or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offer,limiting our ability to pursue acquisitions and increasing the ability of third parties to offer competing financial services and products.   14 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   Our operations are also heavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the UnitedStates. For example, certain of our foreign subsidiaries operate either as a bank or a regulated finance company, and our insurance operations are subject to various requirements in the foreign markets in which we operate. The varying requirementsof these jurisdictions may be inconsistent with U.S. rules and may materially adversely affect our business or limit necessary regulatory approvals, or if approvals are obtained, we may not be able to continue to comply with the terms of theapprovals or applicable regulations. In addition, in many countries, the regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exact regulatory requirements. Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material adverse effect onour operations in that market with regard to the affected product and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and regulations will not beadopted, or that we will not be prohibited by local laws or regulators from raising interest rates above certain desired levels, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, or results ofoperations.  Financial services legislative and regulatory reforms may have a significant impact on our business andresults of operations.  On July 21, 2010, the President of the United States signed into law the Dodd-Frank WallStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act). The Dodd-Frank Act will have material implications for Ally and the entire financial services industry. Among other things, it will or potentially could:     result in Ally being subject to enhanced oversight and scrutiny as a result of being a bank holding company with $50 billion or more inconsolidated assets;      result in the appointment of the FDIC as receiver of Ally in an orderly liquidation proceeding if the Secretary of the Treasury, upon recommendation oftwo-thirds of the FRB and the FDIC and in consultation with the President of the United States, finds Ally to be in default or danger of default;      affect the levels of capital and liquidity with which Ally must operate and how it plans capital and liquidity levels;     subject Ally to new and/or higher fees paid to various regulatory entities, including but not limited to deposit insurance fees to the FDIC;     impact Allys ability to invest in certain types of entities or engage in certain activities;     impact a number of Allys business and risk management strategies;     restrict the revenue that Ally generates from certain businesses; and     subject Ally to a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which will have very broad rule-making and enforcement authorities. As the Dodd-Frank Act requires that many studies be conducted and that hundreds of regulations be writtenin order to fully implement it, the full impact of this legislation on Ally, its business strategies, and financial performance cannot be known at this time and may not be known for a number of years. In addition, regulations may impact usdifferently in comparison to other more established financial institutions. However, these impacts are expected to be substantial and some of them are likely to adversely affect Ally and its financial performance. The extent to which Ally can adjustits strategies to offset such adverse impacts also is not knowable at this time.  Our business may be adversely affectedupon our implementation of the revised capital requirements under the Basel III capital rules.  The Bank for InternationalSettlements Basel Committee on Banking Supervision recently adopted new capital, leverage and liquidity guidelines under the Basel Accord (Basel III), which, when implemented in the United States, may have the  15 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   effect of raising capital requirements beyond those required by current law and the Dodd Frank Act. Basel III increases (i) the minimum Tier 1 common equity ratio to 4.5%, net of regulatorydeductions, and introduces a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% of common equity to risk-weighted assets, raising the target minimum common equity ratio to 7.0% and (ii) the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio to 8.5% inclusive of thecapital conservation buffer, increases the minimum total capital ratio to 10.5% inclusive of the capital buffer and introduces a countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5% of common equity or other fully loss absorbing capital for periods ofexcess credit growth. Basel III also introduces a nonrisk adjusted Tier 1 leverage ratio of 3%, based on a measure of the total exposure rather than total assets, and new liquidity standards. The Basel III capital, leverage and liquiditystandards will be phased in over a multiyear period. The Basel III rules, when implemented, will also impose a 15% cap on the amount of Tier 1 capital that can be met, in the aggregate, through significant investments in the common shares ofunconsolidated financial subsidiaries, mortgage servicing rights (MSRs) and deferred tax assets through timing differences. In addition, under Basel III rules, after a 10-year phase-out period beginning on January 13, 2013, trust preferred andother hybrid securities will no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital. Ally has significant MSRs and a significant amount of trust preferred securities outstanding and the Basel III rules, when implemented, will impose limits on Allysability to meet its regulatory capital requirements through either means.  If we or Ally Bank fail to satisfy regulatorycapital requirements, we or Ally Bank may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to informal or formal supervisory actions by theFRB and/or FDIC and, potentially, FDIC receivership of Ally Bank. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations,and financial position.  The actions of the FRB and international central banking authorities directly impact our cost offunds for lending, capital raising, and investment activities and may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, such changes in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic andinternational monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult to predict.  Future consumer or mortgage legislationcould harm our competitive position.  In addition to the recent enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, various legislativebodies have also recently been considering altering the existing framework governing creditors rights and mortgage products including legislation that would result in or allow loan modifications of various sorts. Such legislation may changebanking statutes and the operating environment in substantial and unpredictable ways. If enacted, such legislation could increase or decrease the cost of doing business; limit or expand permissible activities; or affect the competitive balance amongbanks, savings associations, credit unions, and other financial institutions. We cannot predict whether new legislation will be enacted, and if enacted, the effect that it or any regulations would have on our activities, financial condition, orresults of operations.  Ally and its subsidiaries are or may become involved from time to time in information-gatheringrequests, investigations and proceedings by government and self-regulatory agencies which may lead to adverse consequences. Ally and its subsidiaries, including Ally Bank, are or may become involved from time to time in information-gathering requests, reviews,investigations, and proceedings (both formal and informal) by government and self-regulatory agencies, including the FRB, FDIC, Utah DFI, and SEC regarding their respective operations. Such matters may result in determinations of material weaknessesin our controls and procedures or material adverse consequences including without limitation, adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions, or other actions.  Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the impact of affiliate transaction restrictions imposed in connection with certain financing transactions. Certain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank affiliates, including but not limited to us andResCap, are subject to federal statutory and regulatory restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, covered transactions, including Ally Banks extensions of credit to and asset purchases from itsnonbank affiliates, generally (1) are limited to 10% of Ally Banks capital stock and surplus with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Banks capital stock and surplus for all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credittransactions, are subject to stringent collateralization requirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a low quality asset under federal banking guidelines; and(4) must be conducted in accordance with safe-and-sound banking practices (collectively,   16 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). Under the Dodd-Frank Act, among other changes to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, credit exposures resulting from derivatives transactionsand securities lending and borrowing transactions will be treated as covered transactions. Furthermore, there is an attribution rule that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party will be treated as atransaction between Ally Bank and a nonbank affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, a nonbank affiliate of Ally Bank. Retail financing transactions by Ally Bank involving vehiclesfloor financed by Ally Financial are subject to the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions because the proceeds of the retail financings are deemed to benefit, and are ultimately transferred to, Ally. The FRB is authorized to exempt, in its discretion, transactions or relationships from the requirements of these rules if it finds suchexemptions to be in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the rules. The FRB has granted several such exemptions to Ally Bank. However, the existing exemptions are subject to various conditions and any requests for futureexemptions may not be granted. Moreover, these limited exemptions generally do not encompass consumer leasing or used vehicle financing. Since there is no assurance that Ally Bank will be able to obtain any further exemptions or waivers with respectto these restrictions, the ability to grow Ally Banks business will be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions and the conditions set forth in these exemption letters. Ally may in the future require distributions from its subsidiaries. We currently fund Allys obligations, including dividend payments to our preferred shareholders, and payments of interest andprincipal on our indebtedness, from cash generated by Ally. In the future, Ally may not generate sufficient funds at the parent company level to fund its obligations. As such, Ally may require dividends, distributions, or other payments from itssubsidiaries to fund its obligations. However, regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit the ability of Allys subsidiaries to transfer funds freely to Ally. In particular, many of Allys subsidiaries are subject to laws,regulations, and rules that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to Ally or that prohibit such transfers entirely in certain circumstances. These laws, regulations, and rules may hinder Allys ability to access fundsthat it may need to make payments on its obligations in the future. Furthermore, as a bank holding company, Ally may become subject to a prohibition or to limitations on its ability to pay dividends. The bank regulators have the authority and, undercertain circumstances, the duty to prohibit or to limit payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise, including Ally and its subsidiaries.  Current and future increases in FDIC insurance premiums, including the FDIC special assessment imposed on all FDIC-insured institutions, could decrease our earnings. During 2008 and continuing in 2009 and 2010, higher levels of bank failures have dramatically increased resolution costs of the FDIC anddepleted the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF). In May 2009, the FDIC announced that it had voted to levy a special assessment on insured institutions in order to facilitate the rebuilding of the DIF. In September 2009, the FDIC voted to adoptan increase in the risk-based assessment rate effective beginning January 1, 2011, by three basis points. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act alters the calculation of an insured institutions deposit base for purposes of deposit insuranceassessments and removes the upper limit for the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC each year. On February 7, 2011, the FDIC approved a final rule implementing these changes, which will take effect April 1, 2011. The FDIC willcontinue to assess the changes to the assessment rates at least annually. Future deposit premiums paid by Ally Bank depend on the level of the DIF and the magnitude and cost of future bank failures. Any increases in deposit insuranceassessments could decrease our earnings.  Risks Related to Our Business The profitability and financial condition of our operations are heavily dependent upon the performance, operations, and prospects of GMand Chrysler.  GM, GM dealers, and GM-related employees compose a significant portion of our customer base, and ourdomestic and, in particular, our International Automotive Finance operations are highly dependent on GM production and sales volume. In 2010, 66% of our North American new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 66% of our North American new vehicleconsumer automotive financing volume were for GM dealers and customers. In addition, 90% of our international new vehicle dealer inventory financing and 82% of our international new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for GM dealersand customers. Furthermore, we have expanded our financing footprint to Chrysler dealers and customers. We have entered into an agreement with Chrysler to provide automotive financing products and services to Chrysler dealers and  17 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   customers pursuant to which we will be the preferred provider of new wholesale financing for Chrysler dealer inventory. In 2010, 26% of our North American new vehicle dealer inventory financingand 31% of our North American new vehicle consumer automotive financing volume were for Chrysler dealers and customers. Allys agreements with GM and Chrysler to provide automotive financing products to their dealers and customers extend throughDecember and April 2013, respectively. These agreements provide Ally with certain preferred provider benefits including limiting the use of other financing providers by GM and Chrysler in their incentive programs. The terms of the Ally agreementwith GM changed after January 1, 2011, such that GM is now able to offer any incentive programs on a graduated basis through third parties on a nonexclusive, side-by-side basis with Ally, provided that the pricing of the third parties meetscertain requirements. Due to the highly competitive nature of the market for financial services, Ally may be unable to extend one or both of these agreements or may face less favorable terms upon extension. If Ally is unable to extend one or both ofthese agreements or if GM enters a similar agreement with a third party, Allys retail financing volumes could be materially and adversely impacted.  On October 1, 2010, GM acquired AmeriCredit Corp. (which GM subsequently renamed General Motors Financial Company, Inc.), an independent automotive finance company that focuses on providing leasingand subprime financing options. If GM were to direct substantially more business, including wholesale financing business, to its captive on noncommercial terms thus reducing its reliance on our services over time, it could have a material adverseeffect on our profitability and financial condition. In addition, it is possible that GM or other automotive manufacturers could utilize other existing companies to support their financing needs including offering products or terms that we would notor could not offer, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operations. Furthermore, other automotive manufacturers could expand or establish or acquire captive finance companies to support their financing needs thus reducingtheir need for our services.  A significant adverse change in GMs or Chryslers business, including significantadverse changes in their respective liquidity position and access to the capital markets; the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the quality or resale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles; the use of GM or Chrysler marketing incentives;GMs or Chryslers relationships with its key suppliers; or GMs or Chryslers relationship with the United Auto Workers and other labor unions and other factors impacting GM or Chrysler or their respective employees, could havea material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. In addition, growth in our International Automotive Finance operations are highly dependent on GM, and therefore any significant change to GMs international business orour relationship with GM may hinder our ability achieve our stated goal of expanding internationally.  There is no assurancethat the global automotive market or GMs and Chryslers respective share of that market will not suffer downturns in the future. Vehicle sales volume could be further adversely affected by any additional restructuring activities that GMor Chrysler may decide to pursue, if any. Any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.  Our business requires substantial capital and liquidity, and disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, capitalpositions, and financial condition.  Our liquidity and the long-term viability of Ally depend on many factors includingour ability to successfully raise capital and secure appropriate bank financing. We are currently required to maintain a Total risk-based capital ratio of 15% and a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 15% at Ally Bank. The latter will require that Allymaintain substantial equity funds in Ally Bank and inject substantial additional equity funds into Ally Bank as Ally Banks assets increase over time.  We have significant maturities of unsecured debt each year. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding, it continues to remain a critical component of our capital structure and financingplans. At December 31, 2010, approximately $9.5 billion in principal amount of total outstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2011, and approximately $12.6 billion and $1.9 billion in principal amount of consolidatedunsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2012 and 2013, respectively, which includes $7.4 billion in principal amount of debt issued under the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guaranty Program that matures in 2012. We also obtain short-term fundingfrom the sale by Ally of floating rate demand notes, all of which the holders may elect to have redeemed by Ally at any time without restriction. At December 31, 2010, a total of $2 billion in principal amount of demand notes wereoutstanding. We also rely on secured funding. At December 31, 2010, approximately $13.5 billion of outstanding consolidated secured debt is scheduled to mature   18 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   in 2011, approximately $9.1 billion is scheduled to mature in 2012, and approximately $8.6 billion is scheduled to mature in 2013. Furthermore, at December 31, 2010, approximately$11.8 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank is scheduled to mature in 2011, which is not included in the 2011 unsecured maturities provided above. Additional financing will be required to fund a material portion of the debt maturities overthis period. The capital markets continue to be volatile, and Allys access to the debt markets may be significantly reduced during periods of market stress. In addition, we will continue to have significant original issue discount amortizationexpenses (OID expense) in the near future, which will adversely affect our net income and resulting capital position. OID expense was $303 million in the fourth quarter of 2010, and the scheduled amortization is $975 million, $350 million, and$263 million in 2011, 2012, and 2013, respectively.  As a result of the volatility in the markets and our current unsecureddebt ratings, we have increased our reliance on various secured debt markets. Although market conditions have improved, there can be no assurances that this will continue. In addition, we continue to rely on our ability to borrow from otherfinancial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions and a tightening of credit availability could have a negative effect on our ability to refinance these facilitiesand increase the costs of bank funding. In particular, our $7.9 billion syndicated facility that can fund our U.S. and Canadian automotive retail and commercial loans as well as leases is set to mature in June 2011 and Ally Banks $7.0billion revolving syndicated credit facility is set to mature in April 2011. While we plan to renew these facilities, we cannot be certain that we will be able to renew them on terms favorable or acceptable to us. Ally and Ally Bank also continue toaccess the securitization markets. While markets have begun to stabilize following the recent liquidity crisis, there can be no assurances these sources of liquidity will remain available to us. Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and could materially and adversely affect our business. We have a significant amount of indebtedness. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $96.8 billion in principal amount ofindebtedness outstanding (including $42.4 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constituted approximately 54% of our total financing revenue and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2010.In addition, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2010, we declared and paid preferred stock dividends of $1.2 billion in the aggregate.  We have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt service obligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additionalindebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness alsocould limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economic conditions.  The worldwide financial services industry is highly competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully or if there is increased competition in the automotive financing, mortgage, and/or insurancemarkets or generally in the markets for securitizations or asset sales, our business could be negatively affected.  Themarkets for automotive and mortgage financing, banking, and insurance are highly competitive. The market for automotive financing, in particular the used vehicle market, has grown more competitive as more consumers are financing their new and usedvehicle purchases, primarily in North America and Europe. Our mortgage business and Ally Bank face significant competition from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage companies, and other financial institutions. Our insurance businessfaces significant competition from insurance carriers, reinsurers, third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate.Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, have lower costs of capital, and are less reliant on securitization and sale activities. We face significant competition in various areas including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, andcustomer service. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our profitability and financial condition could be negatively affected.  The markets for asset and mortgage securitizations and whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In addition, lenders andother investors within those markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers, originators, and asset classes, or they may require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased issuance by otherparticipants in the market or decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure to (or to require a higher yield for) us or to automotive or mortgage securitizations or whole loans could negatively affect our ability and that of our subsidiariesto price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us.   19 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses, and we maybe required to materially increase our allowance, which may adversely affect our capital, financial condition, and results of operations.  We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expenses, which represents managements best estimate of probable credit lossesthat have been incurred within the existing portfolio of loans, all as described under Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The allowance, in the judgment of management, is established to reserve for estimated loan losses and risksinherent in the loan portfolio. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks using existingqualitative and quantitative information, all of which may undergo material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans, and other factors, bothwithin and outside of our control, may require an increase in the allowance for loan losses.  Bank regulatory agenciesperiodically review our allowance for loan losses, as well as our methodology for calculating our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or the recognition of additional loan charge-offs, based onjudgments different than those of management. An increase in the allowance for loan losses results in a decrease in net income and capital and may have a material adverse effect on our capital, financial condition and results of operations. Our mortgage subsidiary, ResCap, requires substantial liquidity and capital which could have an adverse effect on our owncapital and liquidity position.  ResCap remains heavily reliant on support from us to meet its liquidity and capitalrequirements, which includes approximately $2.3 billion in principal amount of indebtedness scheduled to mature in 2011, 2012 and 2013. In addition, ResCap has commitments to lend up to $2.3 billion under existing home equity lines of credit it hasextended to customers. Recent developments in the market for many types of mortgage products (including mortgage-backed securities) have resulted in reduced liquidity for these assets. As a result, a significant portion of ResCaps assets arerelatively illiquid. Any negative events with respect to ResCap could serve as a further drain on our financial resources. Pursuant to an existing contractual arrangement, ResCap is precluded from paying any dividends to us, including any additional capitalthat we may provide in the future, if any.  ResCap employs various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rateand prepayment risk inherent in many of its assets including its mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio, MSRs, its portfolio of held-for-investment mortgage loans, and interests from securitizations. A significant portion of ResCaps operatingcash at any given time may consist of funds delivered to it as credit support by counterparties to these arrangements. However, interest rate movements during 2010 required ResCap to return a significant amount of such funds. As interest rateschange and dependent upon the hedge position, ResCap may need to continue to repay or deliver cash as credit support for these arrangements. If the amount ResCap must repay or deliver is substantial, depending on its liquidity position at that time,ResCap may not be able to pay such amounts as required.  The protracted period of adverse developments in the mortgagefinance and credit markets has adversely affected ResCaps business, liquidity, and its capital position and has raised substantial doubt about ResCaps ability to continue as a going concern. ResCap has been adversely affected by the events and conditions in the broader mortgage banking industry, most severely but not limitedto the domestic nonprime and nonconforming and international mortgage loan markets. Fair market valuations of held-for-sale mortgage loans, MSRs, and securitized interests that continue to be held by ResCap and other assets and liabilities ResCaprecords at fair value may continue to deteriorate if there continues to be weakness in housing prices, increasing mortgage rates, or increased severity of delinquencies and defaults of mortgage loans. These deteriorating factors previously resultedin higher provision for loan losses on ResCaps held-for-investment mortgage loans and real estate-lending portfolios. As a direct result of these events and conditions, ResCap discontinued new originations in all of its internationaloperations and sold its U.K. and European operations and currently generally only purchases or originates mortgage loans that can be sold in the form of securitizations guaranteed by the GSEs. If the GSEs became unable or unwilling to purchasemortgage loans from ResCap, it would have a materially adverse impact on ResCaps funding and liquidity and on its ability to originate or purchase new mortgage loans.   20 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   ResCap is highly leveraged relative to its cash flow and has previously recognizedsubstantial losses resulting in a significant deterioration in capital. There continues to be a risk that ResCap will not be able to meet its debt service obligations, will default on its financial debt covenants due to insufficient capital orliquidity, and/or be in a negative liquidity position in 2011 or beyond. ResCap remains heavily dependent on Ally for funding and capital support, and there can be no assurance that Ally will continue to provide such support. In light of ResCaps liquidity and capital needs combined with volatile conditions in the marketplace, there is substantial doubtabout ResCaps ability to continue as a going concern. If Ally determines to no longer support ResCaps capital or liquidity needs or if ResCap or Ally are unable to successfully execute effective initiatives, it could have a materialadverse effect on ResCaps business, results of operations, and financial position.  There is a significant risk thatResCap will not be able to meet its debt service obligations and other funding obligations in the near term.  ResCapexpects its liquidity pressures to continue in 2011. ResCap is highly leveraged relative to its cash flow. At December 31, 2010, ResCaps unrestricted liquidity (cash readily available to cover operating demands from across its businessoperations) totaled $444 million with cash and cash equivalents totaling $672 million.  ResCap expects that additional andcontinuing liquidity pressure, which is difficult to forecast with precision, will result from the obligation of its subsidiaries to advance delinquent principal, interest, property taxes, casualty insurance premiums, home equity line advances, andcertain other amounts with respect to mortgage loans its subsidiaries service that become delinquent. In addition, ResCap continues to be subject to financial covenants requiring it to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth andconsolidated liquidity balances. ResCap will attempt to meet these and other liquidity and capital demands through a combination of cash flow from operations and financings, potential asset sales, and other various alternatives. To the extent thesesources prove insufficient, ResCap will be dependent on continued support from Ally to the extent Ally agrees to provide such support. Ally currently provides funding and capital support to ResCap through various facilities, including a$500 million unsecured line of credit. The sufficiency of these sources of additional liquidity cannot be assured, and any asset sales, even if they raise sufficient cash to meet ResCaps liquidity needs, may adversely affect its overallprofitability and financial condition.  Moreover, even if ResCap is successful in implementing all of the actions describedabove, its ability to satisfy its liquidity needs and comply with any covenants included in its debt agreements requiring maintenance of minimum cash balances may be affected by additional factors and events (such as interest rate fluctuations andmargin calls) that increase ResCaps cash needs making ResCap unable to independently satisfy its near term liquidity requirements.  We have extensive financing and hedging arrangements with ResCap, which could be at risk of nonpayment if ResCap were to file for bankruptcy. We have secured financing arrangements and secured hedging agreements in place with ResCap. Amounts outstanding under the securedfinancing and hedging arrangements fluctuate. If ResCap were to file for bankruptcy, ResCaps repayments of its financing facilities, including those with us, will be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and regulations, or ResCap may be unable torepay its financing facilities. In addition, we could be an unsecured creditor of ResCap to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of our collateral are insufficient to repay ResCaps obligations to us. In addition, it is possible thatother ResCap creditors would seek to recharacterize our loans to ResCap as equity contributions or to seek equitable subordination of our claims so that the claims of other creditors would have priority over our claims. We may also find itadvantageous to provide debtor-in-possession financing to ResCap in a bankruptcy proceeding in order to preserve the value of the collateral ResCap has pledged to us. In addition, should ResCap file for bankruptcy, our investment related toResCaps equity position would likely be reduced to zero, and creditors of ResCap may attempt to assert claims directly against us for payment of their obligations.  We may be required to repurchase mortgage or other loans or indemnify investors if we breach representations and warranties, which could harm our profitability. When we sell mortgage or other loans (such as retail automotive contracts) through whole-loan sales or securitizations, we are requiredto make customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser or securitization trust. These representations and warranties relate to, among other things, the ownership of the loan, the validity of the lien securing  21 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   the loan, the loans compliance with the criteria for inclusion in the transaction, including compliance with underwriting standards or loan criteria established by the buyer, ability todeliver required documentation, and compliance with applicable laws. Generally, the representations and warranties described above may be enforced at any time over the life of the loan. We use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for representation and warranty exposure. It is difficult to determine theaccuracy of our estimates and assumptions, and our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. A material difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may materially adversely affectour cash flow, profitability and financial condition.  As the mortgage industry continues to experience higher repurchaserequirements and additional investors begin to attempt to put back loans, a significant increase in activity beyond that experienced today could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position. Certain of our mortgage subsidiaries face potential legal liability resulting from legal claims related to the sale ofprivate-label mortgage-backed securities.  Claims related to private-label mortgage-backed securities (PLS) have beenbrought under federal and state securities laws and contract laws (among other theories), and it is possible that additional similar claims, including claims from other third-party claimants, will be brought in the future. The claims made to dateare similar in some respects to the repurchase demands we have previously disclosed related to alleged breaches of representations and warranties that our mortgage subsidiaries made in connection with mortgage loans they sold or securitized.Further, and as previously disclosed, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), as conservator of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, announced on July 12, 2010, that it issued 64 subpoenas to various entities seeking documents related to PLS in whichFannie Mae and Freddie Mac had invested. Certain of our mortgage subsidiaries received such subpoenas. In connection with our settlement with Fannie Mae announced on December 23, 2010, the FHFA has agreed to withdraw the subpoenas that relateto Fannie Mae. However, we continue to respond to the subpoenas related to Freddie Mac. The FHFA has indicated that documents provided in response to the subpoenas will enable the FHFA to determine whether they believe issuers of PLS are potentiallyliable to Freddie Mac for losses they might have suffered. A final outcome in any existing or future legal proceeding related to the foregoing, if unfavorable, could result in additional liability, which could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition.  Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsoredmortgage programs, restrictions on our access to such programs, or disruptions in the secondary markets in the United States or in other countries in which we operate could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. Our ability to generate revenue through mortgage loan sales to institutional investors in the United States depends to a significantdegree on programs administered by the GSEs and others that facilitate the issuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These GSEs play a powerful role in the residential mortgage industry and we have significant businessrelationships with them. Proposals have been enacted in the U.S. Congress and are under consideration by various regulatory authorities that would affect the manner in which these GSEs conduct their business to require them to register their stockwith the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to reduce or limit certain business benefits that they receive from the U.S. government and to limit the size of the mortgage loan portfolios that they may hold. Furthermore, the Obama administrationrecently released a report that recommended winding down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We do not know what impact, if any, the report would have on the future of the GSEs. In addition, the GSEs themselves have been negatively affected by recentmortgage market conditions, including conditions that have threatened their access to debt financing. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operation of these GSEs could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Also, anysignificant adverse change in the level of activity in the secondary market including declines in institutional investors desire to invest in our mortgage products could materially adversely affect our business. We are exposed to consumer credit risk, which could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well ascontracts and loans that are securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. For example, the continued decline in the domestic housing market and the increase in unemployment rates resulted in an increase in delinquency rates related tomortgage loans that ResCap and Ally Bank either hold or retain an interest in. Furthermore, a weak economic   22 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   environment, high unemployment rates, and the continued deterioration of the housing market could exert pressure on our consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher delinquencies,repossessions, and losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies, andloss-mitigation strategies are, or will be, sufficient to prevent a further adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. In addition, we have begun to increase our used car and nonprime car financing (nonprime car financing). As wegrow our automotive asset portfolio in nonprime car financing loans over time, our credit risk may increase. As part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionallyor negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction may be increased.  General business and economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the United States and in the markets in which weoperate outside the United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased short and long term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the debt capital markets, unemployment rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or adecline in the strength of national and local economies and other factors that negatively affect household incomes could decrease demand for our financing and mortgage products and increase mortgage and financing delinquency and losses on ourcustomer and dealer financing operations. We have been negatively affected due to the recent significant stress in the residential real estate and related capital markets and, in particular, the lack of home price appreciation in many markets inwhich we lend. Further, a significant and sustained increase in fuel prices could lead to diminished new and used vehicle purchases and negatively affect our automotive finance business. If the rate of inflation were to increase, or if the debt capital markets or the economies of the United States or our markets outsidethe United States were to weaken, or if home prices or new and used vehicle purchases experience declines, we could be significantly and adversely affected, and it could become more expensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business andeconomic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to our businesses could decrease (1) the demand for our mortgage loans and new and used vehicle financing and (2) the value of thecollateral underlying our portfolio of held-for-investment mortgages and new and used vehicle loans and interests that continue to be held by us, thus further increasing the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans. Inaddition, the rate of delinquencies, foreclosures, and losses on our loans (especially our nonprime mortgage loans) as experienced recently could be higher during more severe economic slowdowns. Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses could further harm our ability to sell our mortgage and new andused vehicle loans, the prices we receive for our mortgage and new and used vehicle loans, or the value of our portfolio of mortgage and new and used vehicle loans held-for-investment or interests from our securitizations, which could harm ourrevenues, profitability, and financial condition. Continued adverse business and economic conditions could affect demand for housing, new and used vehicles, the cost of construction, and other related factors that could harm the revenues andprofitability of our business.  In addition, our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetarypolicies of the U.S. government and its agencies and similar governmental authorities in the markets in which we operate outside the United States. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply of money andcredit in the United States. The FRBs policies influence the new and used vehicle financing market and the size of the mortgage origination market, which significantly affects the earnings of our businesses and the earnings of our businesscapital activities. The FRBs policies also influence the yield on our interest earning assets and the cost of our interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and could adverselyaffect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.  Acts or threats of terrorism and political or militaryactions taken by the United States or other governments could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions. Geopolitical conditions may affect our earnings. Acts or threats of terrorism and political or military actions taken by the UnitedStates or other governments in response to terrorism, or similar activity, could adversely affect general economic or industry conditions.   23 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   The U.S. Department of the Treasury (the Treasury) holds a majority of theoutstanding Ally Common Stock.

Generally, matters to be voted on by thestockholders must be approved by either (1) a majority of the voting power present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote or (2) in the case of certain specified actions, the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding sharesof Common Stock including at least two such holders, in each case subject to state law and any voting rights granted to any of the holders of Allys preferred stock.  As a result of its ownership of Common Stock (including any shares of Common Stock that it may acquire in the future pursuant to the conversion of shares of the Series F-2 Preferred Stock or otherwise),and its right to appoint six directors to the Ally Board of Directors, the Treasury may be able, subject to the terms of Allys certificate of incorporation and bylaws, to significantly influence Allys business and strategy. Ally cannotbe certain that the Treasury will not seek to influence Allys business in a manner that is contrary to Allys goals or strategies or the interests of other stakeholders. In addition, persons who are appointed directors of Ally by theTreasury may decline to take action in a manner that might be favorable to Ally but adverse to the Treasury.  Thelimitations on compensation imposed on us due to our participation in TARP, including the restrictions placed on our compensation by the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, may adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate ourexecutives and employees.  Our performance is dependent on the talent and efforts of our management team and employees. Asa result of our participation in TARP, the compensation of certain members of our management team and employees is subject to extensive restrictions under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery andReinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, as implemented by the Interim Final Rule issued by the Treasury on June 15, 2009 (the IFR). In addition, due to our level of participation in TARP, pursuantto ARRA and the IFR, the Office of the Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation has the authority to further regulate our compensation arrangements with certain of our executives and employees. In addition, we may become subject to furtherrestrictions under any other future legislation or regulation limiting executive compensation. Many of the restrictions are not limited to our senior executives and affect other employees whose contributions to revenue and performance may besignificant. These limitations may leave us unable to create a compensation structure that permits us to retain and motivate certain of our executives and employees or to attract new executives or employees, especially if we are competing againstinstitutions that are not subject to the same restrictions. Any such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets depend significantly on our credit ratings. The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by our short- and long-term credit ratings. Each ofStandard & Poors Rating Services; Moodys Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates our debt. Our current ratings as assigned by each of the respective rating agencies are below investmentgrade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the unsecured market. Ratings reflect the rating agencies opinions of our financial strength, operating performance, strategic position, and abilityto meet our obligations. Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing costs and further constrain our access to the unsecured debt markets and, as a result, would negatively affect our business. In addition, downgrades of ourcredit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements as well as impact elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuingorganization. Each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating.   24 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   Our profitability and financial condition could be materially and adversely affectedif the residual value of off-lease vehicles decrease in the future.  Our expectation of the residual value of a vehiclesubject to an automotive lease contract is a critical element used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent the actual residual value of the vehicle, asreflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing at lease termination, is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we incur additional depreciation expense and/or a loss on the lease transaction. Generaleconomic conditions, the supply of off lease and other vehicles to be sold, new vehicle market prices, perceived vehicle quality, overall price and volatility of gasoline or diesel fuel, among other factors, heavily influence used vehicle prices andthus the actual residual value of off lease vehicles. Consumer confidence levels and the strength of auto manufacturers and dealers can also influence the used vehicle market. For example, during 2008, sharp declines in demand and used vehicle saleprices adversely affected Allys remarketing proceeds and financial results.  Vehicle brand images, consumer preference,and vehicle manufacturer marketing programs that influence new and used vehicle markets also influence lease residual values. In addition, our ability to efficiently process and effectively market off lease vehicles affects the disposal costs andproceeds realized from the vehicle sales. While manufacturers, at times, may provide support for lease residual values including through residual support programs, this support does not in all cases entitle us to full reimbursement for thedifference between the remarketing sales proceeds for off lease vehicles and the residual value specified in the lease contract. Differences between the actual residual values realized on leased vehicles and our expectations of such values atcontract inception could have a negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.  Current conditions in theresidential mortgage market and housing markets may continue to adversely affect Allys mortgage business.  Theresidential mortgage market in the United States and other international markets in which our Mortgage operations conduct, or previously conducted, business have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions that adverselyaffected our mortgage business results of operations and financial condition. Delinquencies and losses with respect to our Legacy Portfolio and Other segments nonprime mortgage loans increased significantly. Housing prices in many partsof the United States, the United Kingdom, and other international markets also declined or stopped appreciating after extended periods of significant appreciation. In addition, the liquidity provided to the mortgage sector had been significantlyreduced. This liquidity reduction combined with our decision to reduce our mortgage business exposure to the nonprime mortgage market caused its nonprime mortgage production to decline. Similar trends have emerged beyond the nonprime sector,especially at the lower end of the prime credit quality scale, and have had a similar effect on our mortgage business related liquidity needs and businesses. These trends have resulted in significant write-downs to our Legacy Portfolio andOthers held-for-sale mortgage loans and trading securities portfolios and additions to its allowance for loan losses for its held-for-investment mortgage loans and warehouse-lending receivables portfolios. A continuation of these conditionsmay continue to adversely affect our mortgage business financial condition and results of operations.  Moreover, thecontinued deterioration of the U.S. housing market and decline in home prices since 2008 in many U.S. markets, which may continue for the near term, could result in increased delinquencies or defaults on the mortgage assets ResCap owns andservices as well as those mortgage assets owned by Ally Bank. Further, loans that our Mortgage operations historically made based on limited credit or income documentation also increase the likelihood of future increases in delinquencies or defaultson mortgage loans. An increase in delinquencies or defaults will result in a higher level of credit losses and credit-related expenses and increased liquidity requirements to fund servicing advances, all of which in turn will reduce revenues andprofits of our mortgage business. Higher credit losses and credit-related expenses also could adversely affect our financial condition.  Our lending volume is generally related to the rate of growth in U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of the U.S. residential mortgage market. Recently, the rate of growth in total U.S.residential mortgage debt outstanding has slowed sharply in response to the reduced activity in the housing market and national declines in home prices. In addition, most of our mortgage business is currently conducted through the correspondentchannel, which relies heavily on the mortgage refinancing business. The volume of mortgage refinancing experienced a significant increase in 2009 and 2010 due to interest rate decreases, but we expect it will experience a significant decrease in2011 as interest rates increase. A decline in the rate of growth in mortgage debt outstanding reduces the number of mortgage loans available for us to purchase or securitize, which in turn could lead to a reduction in our revenue, profits, andbusiness prospects.   25 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   Our earnings may decrease because of increases or decreases in interest rates. Changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business. For example:     rising interest rates will increase our cost of funds;     rising interest rates may reduce our consumer automotive financing volume by influencing customers to pay cash for, as opposed to financing, vehiclepurchases or not to buy new vehicles;      rising interest rates may negatively impact our ability to remarket off lease vehicles;     rising interest rates generally reduce our residential mortgage loan production as borrowers become less likely to refinance and the costs associatedwith acquiring a new home become more expensive; and      rising interest rates will generally reduce the value of mortgage and automotive financing loans and contracts and retained interests and fixed incomesecurities held in our investment portfolio.  We are also subject to risks from decreasing interest rates.For example, a significant decrease in interest rates could increase the rate at which mortgages are prepaid, which could require us to write down the value of our retained interests and MSRs. Moreover, if prepayments are greater than expected, thecash we receive over the life of our held-for-investment mortgage loans and our retained interests would be reduced. Higher-than-expected prepayments could also reduce the value of our MSRs and, to the extent the borrower does not refinance with us,the size of our servicing portfolio. Therefore, any such changes in interest rates could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.  Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could affect our profitability and financial condition as could our failure to complywith hedge accounting principles and interpretations.  We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate theinterest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities, and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove tobe incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. In addition, wemay not be able to find market participants that are willing to act as our hedging counterparties, which could have an adverse effect on the success of our hedging strategies.  In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) requires the application of significant subjective judgments to a body ofaccounting concepts that is complex and for which the interpretations have continued to evolve within the accounting profession and among the standard-setting bodies.  A failure of or interruption in, as well as, security risks of the communications and information systems on which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of ourinformation systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely as a result of inadequate or failed processes or systems, human errors, or external events could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer applicationsbeing received, slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in servicing. In addition, our communication and information systems may present security risks, and could be susceptible to hacking or identity theft. The occurrence of anyof these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We use estimates and assumptions in determining thefair value of certain of our assets in determining lease residual values and in determining our reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability,financial condition, and business prospects could be materially and adversely affected.  We use estimates and variousassumptions in determining the fair value of many of our assets, including certain held-for-investment and held-for-sale loans for which we elected fair value accounting, retained interests from securitizations of loans and contracts, MSRs, andother investments, which do not have an established market value or are not publicly traded. We   26 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   also use estimates and assumptions in determining the residual values of leased vehicles. In addition, we use estimates and assumptions in determining our reserves for insurance losses and lossadjustment expenses which represent the accumulation of estimates for both reported losses and those incurred, but not reported, including claims adjustment expenses relating to direct insurance and assumed reinsurance agreements. For furtherdiscussion related to estimates and assumptions, refer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section of the Management Discussion & Analysis. It is difficult to determine the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, and our actual experiencemay differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. A material difference between our estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects. Our business outside the United States exposes us to additional risks that may cause our revenues and profitability todecline.  We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United States exposing us to risks such as thefollowing:      multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change;     differing local product preferences and product requirements;     fluctuations in foreign interest rates;      difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing foreign operations;     differing labor regulations;      consequences from changes in tax laws;      restrictions on our ability to repatriate profits or transfer cash into or out of foreign countries; and     political and economic instability, natural calamities, war and terrorism. The effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our business could be adversely affected by changes in foreign-currency exchange rates. We are exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign-currency exchange rates. Changes in currency exchange rates can havea significant impact on our earnings from international operations as a result of foreign-currency-translation adjustments. While we carefully monitor and attempt to manage our exposure to fluctuation in currency exchange rates throughforeign-currency hedging activities, these types of changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Fluctuations in valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues. Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation. Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investmentmay significantly differ from the reported market value that could negatively affect our revenues. Additionally, negative fluctuations in the value of available for sale investment securities could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity.Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, national and international events, and general marketconditions.  Significant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or loan repurchase activity of retail contracts orleases or mortgage loans could harm our profitability and financial condition.  We have repurchase obligations in ourcapacity as servicer in securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive receivable or mortgage loan, the servicer may be required by the servicingprovisions to repurchase that asset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets or other payments occurs increases substantially fromits present rate, the result could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.   27 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   In connection with its servicing of securitized mortgage loans, ResCap is subject tocontractual caps on the percentage of mortgage loans it is permitted to modify in any securitized pool. The financial crisis has resulted in dramatic increases in the volume of delinquent mortgage loans over the past three years. In an effort toachieve the best net present value recovery for the securitization trust, ResCap increased the volume of modifications of distressed mortgage loans to assist homeowners and avoid liquidating properties in a collapsing and opaque housing market. Incertain securitization transactions, ResCap has exceeded the applicable contractual modification cap. The securitization documents provide that the contractual caps can be raised or eliminated with the concurrence of each rating agency rating thetransaction. For certain transactions with respect to which loan modifications have exceeded the contractual caps, the rating agencies have concurred in raising or eliminating the caps, but they have not consented in connection with other suchtransactions. ResCap will continue to seek their concurrence in connection with other transactions as it deems appropriate and will suspend modifications in excess of applicable caps pending receipt of such consent or investor approval to amend theservicing contracts. An investor in a specific mortgage security class might claim that modifications in excess of the applicable cap amounted to a material failure of ResCap to perform its servicing obligations and that the investor was damaged asa result. Such claims, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.  A loss of contractual servicing rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. We are the servicer for all of the receivables we have acquired or originated and transferred to other parties in securitizations andwhole-loan sales of automotive receivables. Our mortgage subsidiaries service the mortgage loans we have securitized, and we service the majority of the mortgage loans we have sold in whole-loan sales. In each case, we are paid a fee for ourservices, which fees in the aggregate constitute a substantial revenue stream for us. In each case, we are subject to the risk of termination under the circumstances specified in the applicable servicing provisions. In most securitizations and whole-loan sales, the owner of the receivables or mortgage loans will be entitled to declare a servicerdefault and terminate the servicer upon the occurrence of specified events. These events typically include a bankruptcy of the servicer, a material failure by the servicer to perform its obligations, and a failure by the servicer to turn over fundson the required basis. The termination of these servicing rights, were it to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations and those of our mortgage subsidiaries. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) could adversely affect our reportedrevenues, profitability, and financial condition.  Our financial statements are subject to the application of GAAP, whichare periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretationsthat are issued from time to time by various parties, including accounting standard setters and those who interpret the standards, such as the FASB and the SEC, banking regulators, and our independent registered public accounting firm. Those changescould adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.  Recently, the FASB has proposed newfinancial accounting standards, and has many active projects underway, that could materially affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition. These proposed standards or projects include the potential for significant changes inthe accounting for financial instruments (including loans, deposits, and debt) and the accounting for leases, among others. It is possible that any changes, if enacted, could adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financialcondition.  The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty, or other relationships. We have exposureto different counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers, commercial banks, investment banks, and other institutions. Many of these transactions exposeus to credit risk in the event of default or our counterparty.   28 Table of ContentsAlly Financial Inc.  Form 10-K   Our inability to maintain relationships with dealers could have an adverse effect onour business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Our business depends on the continuation of ourrelationships with our customers, particularly the automotive dealers with whom we do business. If we are not able to maintain existing relationships with key automotive dealers or if we are not able to develop new relationships for any reason,including if we are not able to provide services on a timely basis or offer products that meet the needs of the dealers, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Adverse economic conditions or changes in laws in states in which we have customer concentrations may negative affect our operatingresults and financial condition.  We are exposed to consumer loan portfolio concentration in California and Texas andconsumer mortgage loan concentration in California, Florida, and Michigan.

3,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2010-03-01,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  Ourbusinesses face many risks and uncertainties, any of which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We believe that the most significant of the risks and uncertainties that we face are describedbelow. This Form 10-K is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors.  Risks Related to Being a Bank Holding Company Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by regulations to which we aresubject as a result of our bank holding company status.  On December 24, 2008, the FRB approved our applicationto become a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the BHC Act). As a bank holding company, we are subject to the supervision and examination by the FRB, are required to file various reports with theFRB, must comply with regulatory risk-based and leverage capital requirements as well as various safety and soundness standards imposed by the FRB, and are subject to certain statutory restrictions concerning the types of assets or securities we mayown and the activities in which we may engage. The FRB has the authority to issue orders to bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices and from violations of laws, rules, regulations, or conditions imposed inwriting by the FRB. The FRB is also empowered to assess civil money penalties against institutions or individuals who violate any laws, regulations, orders, or written agreements with the FRB, to order termination of certain activities of bankholding companies, and to order termination of ownership and control of a banking or nonbanking subsidiary by a bank holding company. In addition, Ally Bank is subject to regulation and examination primarily by the FDIC and the Utah Departmentof Financial Institutions. This regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors, the federal Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Many of these regulatory requirements are new for us and willrequire significant expense and  9 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   devotion of resources to fully implement processes that will be necessary to ensure compliance. The cost of compliance with such laws and regulations can be substantial and adversely affect ourability to operate profitably. Current economic conditions, particularly in the financial and real estate markets, have resulted in bank regulatory agencies placing increased focus and scrutiny on participants in the financial services industry,including us.  GMAC and Ally Bank are subject to ongoing supervision by the FRB and FDIC, respectively, through regularexaminations and other means that allow the regulators to gauge managements ability to identify, assess, and control risk in all areas of operations in a safe and sound manner and to ensure compliance with laws and regulations. As part ofGMACs conversion to a bank holding company, GMAC and Ally Bank are currently implementing policies and procedures and taking other actions to improve their current processes and to seek to ensure adherence to applicable regulatory guidelinesand standards including those concerning risk management and controls relating to credit, market, liquidity, operational and legal and compliance risks. The adoption and implementation of these policies, procedures, and other actions may cause us todevote significant time and resources of our management team, which may increase our costs, impede the efficiency of our internal business processes, and adversely affect our profitability in the near term.  If we are unable to implement these policies, procedures, and actions in a timely and effective manner and otherwise comply with therequirements outlined above, we could become subject to supervisory action which could subject us to significant restrictions on our existing business or on our ability to develop any new business. We could also be required to dispose of certainassets and liabilities within a prescribed period of time. The terms of any such supervisory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating flexibility, financial condition, and results of operations.  As a bank holding company, GMACs activities are generally limited to banking or to managing or controlling banks or other companiesengaged in activities deemed closely related to banking or otherwise permissible under the BHC Act. Likewise, GMAC generally may not hold more than 5% of any class of voting shares of any company unless that companys activities conform withthe above requirements. As a recent bank holding company, however, we are permitted a two-year grace period to bring our activities and investments into conformity with these restrictions, and we may also apply to the FRB for three one-yearextensions. This initial grace period expires in December 2010 (unless extended by the FRB), and absent an extension, certain of GMACs existing activities and investments deemed impermissible under the Bank Holding Company Act must beterminated or disposed of within these timeframes. While some of these activities may be continued if GMAC were able to convert to a financial holding company under the BHC Act (including, without limitation, certain of GMACs existinginsurance activities), GMAC may be unable to satisfy the requirements to enable it to convert to a financial holding company prior to that time, and activities, businesses, or investments that would be permissible for a financial holding companywill need to be terminated or disposed of. Likewise, the FRB may decline to grant any requested extension, and GMAC may be obligated to terminate or dispose of any impermissible activities, businesses, or investments more quickly than anticipatedand/or under terms less advantageous to GMAC than expected. Either situation could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.  As a bank holding company, our ability to expand into new business activities may require us to obtain the prior approval of the relevantbanking supervisors. There can be no assurance that any required approval will be obtained or that we will be able to execute on these plans in a timely manner or at all. If we are unable to obtain approval to expand into new business activities,particularly since we are a new bank holding company, our business, results of operations, and financial position may be adversely affected.  Our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the impact of affiliate transaction restrictions imposed in connection with certain GM-related financingtransactions.  Certain transactions between Ally Bank and any of its nonbank affiliates are subject to federalstatutory and regulatory restrictions. Pursuant to these restrictions, unless otherwise exempted, covered transactions (including extensions of credit) between Ally Bank and its nonbank affiliates (1) generally are limited to10% of Ally Banks capital stock and surplus with an aggregate limit of 20% of Ally Banks capital stock and surplus for all such transactions; (2) in the case of certain credit transactions, are subject to stringent collateralizationrequirements; (3) in the case of asset purchases by Ally Bank, may not involve the purchase of any asset deemed to be a low quality asset under federal banking guidelines; and (4) must be conducted in accordance with safe andsound banking practices (collectively, the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions). Furthermore, there is an attribution rule that provides that a transaction between Ally Bank and a third party will be treated as a transaction betweenAlly Bank and an affiliate to the extent that the proceeds of the transaction are used for the benefit of, or transferred to, an affiliate of Ally Bank.   10 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   In approving GMACs conversion to a bank holding company, the FRB determined thatGM would be treated as if it were an affiliate of Ally Bank until GMs ownership of voting shares of and total equity in GMAC (inclusive of shares of GMAC common stock currently held in a separate trust) is reduced to less than 10%.As a result, GM is currently deemed to be an affiliate for purposes of the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions because of the level of GMs continued ownership in GMAC. Extensions of credit by Ally Bank that are deemed to benefit GM, includingwithout limitation, dealer floor-planning arrangements to facilitate a dealers purchase of GM vehicles and extensions of credit to consumers for the purchase of a GM vehicle, are therefore subject to the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions. TheFRB is authorized to exempt, in its discretion, transactions or relationships from the requirements of these rules if it finds such exemptions to be in the public interest and consistent with the purposes of the rules and has granted two suchexemptions to Ally Bank. However, requests for future exemptions may not be granted, and the existing exemptions are subject to various conditions. Such conditions include, among others, an overall cap on covered transactions entered into pursuantto the exemptions, as well as limitations on customers to whom credit may be extended and the terms of such credit extensions. These limited exemptions described above generally do not encompass consumer leasing and generally do not permit Ally Bankto provide any dealer floorplan financing for used GM vehicles. Until such time as either GM is no longer deemed an affiliate of Ally Bank or if GMAC is unable to obtain further exemptions or waivers with respect to these restrictions, the abilityto grow Ally Banks business will be affected by the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions and the conditions set forth in these exemption letters, which could have a material adverse effect on GMACs business, results of operations, andfinancial position.  If we are unable to satisfy applicable regulatory capital requirements in the future, we could becomesubject to enforcement actions and/or FDIC receivership.  As a bank holding company, if we fail to satisfy regulatorycapital requirements, we may be subject to serious regulatory sanctions ranging in severity from being precluded from making acquisitions or engaging in new activities to becoming subject to formal supervisory actions by the FRB and/or FDIC and,potentially, FDIC receivership of Ally Bank. If any of these were to occur, such actions could prevent us from successfully executing our business plan and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financialposition.  Risks Related to Our Business  Our business requires substantial capital, and disruption in our funding sources and access to the capital markets would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.  Our liquidity and the long-term viability of GMAC depend on many factors including our ability to successfully raise capitaland secure appropriate bank financing. We have used the current exemption from the Affiliate Transaction Restrictions granted by the FRB in May 2009 to originate more bank-eligible assets through our banking subsidiary (Ally Bank), but asnoted above, continued or expanded availability of this exemption depends upon the discretion of the FRB, and there can be no assurance that this exemption will be extended once we fully fund the amounts currently permitted. A condition contained inthe exemption is that GMAC must maintain a total risk-based capital ratio of 15% and must also maintain a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 15% at Ally Bank. The latter will require that GMAC maintain substantial equity funds in Ally Bank and injectsubstantial additional equity funds into Ally Bank as Ally Banks assets increase over time.  The FRB, the Treasury, andthe FDIC have created a number of programs to help stabilize the markets and restore confidence and liquidity, some of which we have also used as funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that these programs will be continued or, ifcontinued, that the programs will have a positive impact, and unrelated factors may destabilize the financial condition and liquidity profile of the companies that participate in these programs including GMAC.  As Ally Bank continues to be a key part of our funding strategy, we have increased our reliance on deposits, (which as ofDecember 31, 2009, included $9.3 billion of brokered certificates of deposit that are more price sensitive than other types of deposits and may become less available if alternative investments offer higher interest rates) as analternative source of funding through Ally Bank. Our ability to maintain our current level of deposits or grow our deposit base may be affected by perceptions of our financial strength, rates offered by third parties, and other competitive factorsbeyond our control. In addition, a banks reliance on brokered deposits is subject to regulatory restrictions including the possible imposition of prior approval requirements or restrictions on deposit growth.   11 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   The FDIC has indicated that it expects GMAC to diversify Ally Banks overallfunding and to focus on reducing Ally Banks overall funding costs including the interest rates paid on Ally Bank deposits. Any such actions could limit Ally Banks ability to grow and maintain deposits, which could have amaterial adverse impact on the funding and capital position of GMAC.  We have significant maturities of unsecured debt eachyear. While we have reduced our reliance on unsecured funding, it continues to remain a critical component of our capital structure and financing plans. As of December 31, 2009, approximately $7.5 billion in principal amount of totaloutstanding consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2010 and approximately $10.0 billion and $12.5 billion in principal amount of consolidated unsecured debt is scheduled to mature in 2011 and 2012, respectively, whichincludes $7.4 billion in principal amount of debt issued under the FDICs Temporary Liquidity Guaranty Program that matures in 2012. We also obtain short-term funding from the sale of floating-rate demand notes, all of which the holdersmay elect to have redeemed by GMAC at any time without restriction. As of December 31, 2009, a total of $1.3 billion in principal amount of demand notes were outstanding. We also rely on secured funding. As ofDecember 31, 2009, approximately $19.6 billion of outstanding consolidated secured debt is scheduled to mature in 2010, approximately $12.6 billion is scheduled to mature in 2011, and approximately $2.9 billion is scheduledto mature in 2012. Furthermore, as of December 31, 2009, approximately $17.3 billion in certificates of deposit at Ally Bank are scheduled to mature in 2010, which is not included in the 2010 unsecured maturities provided above.Additional financing will be required to fund a material portion of the debt maturities over this period. The capital markets continue to be volatile, and GMACs access to the debt markets may be significantly reduced during periods of marketstress. In addition, we will continue to have significant original issue discount amortization expenses related to the 2008 bond exchange ($308 million in the fourth quarter of 2009) in the near future, which will adversely affect our netincome and resulting capital position.  As a result of the volatility in the markets and the reduction in our unsecuredratings, we have increased our reliance on various secured markets. Although market conditions have improved and government programs have increased the availability of credit, there can be no assurances that this will continue. In addition, wecontinue to rely on our ability to borrow from other financial institutions, and many of our primary bank facilities are up for renewal on a yearly basis. Any weakness in market conditions and a tightening of credit availability could have anegative effect on our ability to refinance these facilities and increase the costs of bank funding. We also continue to access the securitization markets at both GMAC and Ally Bank; while markets have begun to stabilize following the recentliquidity crisis, there can be no assurances these sources of liquidity will remain available to us.  Our indebtedness andother obligations are significant and could materially and adversely affect our business.  We have a significant amount ofindebtedness. As of December 31, 2009, we had approximately $102.2 billion in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding (including $44.7 billion in secured indebtedness). Interest expense on our indebtedness constitutedapproximately 52% of our total financing revenues and other interest income for the year ended December 31, 2009. In addition, during the twelve months ending December 31, 2009, we declared and paid preferred stock dividends of$1.2 billion in the aggregate.  We have the ability to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt serviceobligations increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of, andinterest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in responding to changing business and economicconditions.  Our mortgage subsidiary, ResCap, requires substantial liquidity and capital which could have an adverse effecton our own capital and liquidity position.  We have recently provided a significant amount of capital support and fundingto ResCap, and ResCap remains heavily reliant on support from us to meet its liquidity and capital requirements including approximately $2.1 billion in principal amount of bonds scheduled to mature in 2010. Moreover, recent developments in themarket for many types of mortgage products (including mortgage-backed securities) have resulted in reduced liquidity for these assets. As a result, a significant portion of ResCaps assets are relatively illiquid. Any negative events withrespect to ResCap and a decision to provide additional support could serve as a further drain on our financial resources.   12 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   ResCap employs various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate andprepayment risk inherent in many of its assets including its mortgage loans held-for-sale portfolio, mortgage servicing rights, its portfolio of held-for-investment mortgage loans, and interests from securitizations. A significant portion ofResCaps operating cash at any given time consists of funds delivered to it as credit support by counterparties to these arrangements. Although ResCap pays such parties interest on such funds and believes there are no restrictions on itsability to utilize these funds, interest rate movements during 2009 required ResCap to return a significant amount of such funds. In the event that interest rates rise, ResCap could be required to promptly return all or a portion of the remainingfunds that it holds and, if rates change dramatically, to deliver amounts in excess of such funds to such counterparties. If the amount ResCap must repay or deliver is substantial, depending on its liquidity position at that time, ResCap may not beable to pay such amounts as required.  We are exposed to credit risk, which could affect our profitability and financialcondition.  We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment or performance by customers for our contractsand loans, as well as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we retain a residual interest. For example, the continued decline in the domestic housing market and the increase in unemployment rates resulted in an increase indelinquency rates related to mortgage loans that ResCap and Ally Bank either hold or retain an interest in. Furthermore, a weak economic environment, high unemployment rates, and the continued deterioration of the housing market could exert pressureon our consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher delinquencies, repossessions, and losses. There can be no assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it affects the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate creditrisk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies, and loss mitigation strategies are or will be sufficient to prevent a further adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. As part of the underwriting process,we rely heavily upon information supplied by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk associated with thetransaction may be increased.  General business and economic conditions may significantly and adversely affect ourrevenues, profitability, and financial condition.  Our business and earnings are sensitive to general business andeconomic conditions in the United States and in the markets in which we operate outside the United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in increased short- and long-term interest rates, inflation, fluctuations in the debt capitalmarkets, unemployment rates, consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or a decline in the strength of national and local economies and other factors that negatively affect household incomes could decrease demand for our financing and mortgageproducts and increase mortgage and financing delinquency and losses on our customer and dealer financing operations. We have been negatively affected due to (1) the significant stress in the residential real estate and related capital marketsin 2007, 2008, and 2009 and, in particular, the lack of home price appreciation in many markets in which we lend and (2) decreases in new and used vehicle purchases, which have reduced the demand for automotive retail and wholesale financing. If the rate of inflation were to increase, or if the debt capital markets or the economies of the United States or ourmarkets outside the United States were to continue in their current condition or further weaken, or if home prices or new and used vehicle purchases continue at the currently reduced levels or experience further declines, we could continue to besignificantly adversely affected, and it could become more expensive for us to conduct our business. For example, business and economic conditions that negatively affect household incomes, housing prices, and consumer behavior related to ourbusinesses could continue in their current condition or further decrease (1) the demand for our mortgage loans and new and used vehicle financing and (2) the value of the collateral underlying our portfolio ofheld-for-investment mortgages and new and used vehicle loans and interests that continue to be held by us, thus further increasing the number of consumers who become delinquent or default on their loans. In addition, the rate of delinquencies,foreclosures, and losses on our loans (especially our nonprime mortgage loans) as experienced recently could be higher during more severe economic slowdowns.  Any sustained period of increased delinquencies, foreclosures, or losses could further harm our ability to sell our mortgage and new and used vehicle loans, the prices we receive for our mortgage and newand used vehicle loans, or the value of our portfolio of mortgage and new and used vehicle loans held-for-investment or interests from our securitizations, which could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Continued adversebusiness and economic conditions could and, in the near term, likely will further affect demand for housing, new and used vehicles, the cost of construction, and other related factors that have harmed and could continue to harm the revenues andprofitability of our business.   13 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   In addition, our business and earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal andmonetary policies of the U.S. government and its agencies and similar governmental authorities in the markets in which we operate outside the United States. We are particularly affected by the policies of the FRB, which regulates the supply ofmoney and credit in the United States. The FRBs policies influence the new and used vehicle financing market and the size of the mortgage origination market, which significantly affects the earnings of our businesses and the earnings of ourbusiness capital activities. The FRBs policies also influence the yield on our interest-earning assets and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict and couldadversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.  The Treasury holds a majority of the outstandingGMAC Common Stock.  As of December 30, 2009, the Treasury held 450,121 shares of Common Stock whichrepresented, pursuant to GMACs certificate of incorporation and bylaws, approximately 56.3% of the voting power of the holders of Common Stock outstanding as of such date for most matters requiring a vote of the holders of Common Stock. Inaddition, as of the date hereof, the Treasury holds 228,750,000 shares of Series F-2 Preferred Stock (which are convertible into an additional 988,200 shares of Common Stock if converted as of the date hereof), with an aggregateliquidation preference of approximately $11.4 billion. Pursuant to the Amended and Restated Governance Agreement dated May 21, 2009 (see Exhibit 10.2 to GMACs Form 8-K filed with the SEC on May 22, 2009), asof the date hereof, the Treasury also has the right to appoint four of the nine members to the GMAC Board of Directors. The Governance Agreement further provides that upon the acquisition of additional shares of Common Stock (either through thefurther conversion of shares of Series F-2 Preferred Stock to Common Stock or otherwise), the Treasury may be entitled to appoint additional members to the GMAC Board of Directors.  Generally, matters to be voted on by the stockholders must be approved by either (1) a majority of the voting power present in personor by proxy and entitled to vote or (2) in the case of certain specified actions, the vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of Common Stock including at least two such holders, in each case subject to state law and anyvoting rights granted to any of the holders of GMACs preferred stock.  As a result of its ownership of Common Stock(including any shares of Common Stock that it may acquire in the future pursuant to the conversion of shares of the Series F-2 Preferred Stock or otherwise), and its right to appoint four directors to the GMAC Board of Directors (and the possibilitythat it may have the right to appoint additional directors in the future upon conversion of additional shares of Series F-2 Preferred Stock or additional acquisitions of Common Stock), the Treasury may be able, subject to the terms of GMACscertificate of incorporation and bylaws, to significantly influence GMACs business and strategy. GMAC cannot assure you that the Treasury will not seek to influence GMACs business in a manner that is contrary to GMACs goals orstrategies or the interests of other stakeholders. In addition, persons who are appointed directors of GMAC by the Treasury may decline to take action in a manner that might be favorable to GMAC but adverse to the Treasury.  The limitations on compensation imposed on us due to our participation in TARP, including the restrictions placed on our compensation bythe Special Master for TARP Executive Compensation, may adversely affect our ability to retain and motivate our executives and employees.  Our performance is dependent on the talent and efforts of our management team and employees. As a result of our participation in TARP, the compensation of certain members of our management team andemployees is subject to extensive restrictions under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), which was signed into law on February 17, 2009, as implementedby the Interim Final Rule issued by the Department of the Treasury on June 15, 2009 (the IFR). In addition, due to our level of participation in TARP, pursuant to ARRA and the IFR, the Office of the Special Master for TARP ExecutiveCompensation has the authority to further regulate our compensation arrangements with certain of our executives and employees. In addition, we may become subject to further restrictions under any other future legislation or regulation limitingexecutive compensation. Many of the restrictions are not limited to our senior executives and affect other employees whose contributions to revenue and performance may be significant. These limitations may leave us unable to create a compensationstructure that permits us to retain and motivate certain of our executives and employees, especially if we are competing against institutions that are not subject to the same restrictions. Any such inability could have a material and adverse effecton our business, financial condition, and results of operations.   14 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   Our borrowing costs and access to the unsecured debt capital markets dependsignificantly on our credit ratings.  The cost and availability of unsecured financing are materially affected by ourshort- and long-term credit ratings. Each of Standard & Poors Rating Services; Moodys Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and Dominion Bond Rating Service rates our debt. Our ratings by each rating agency aresubstantially below investment grade, which negatively impacts our access to liquidity and increases our borrowing costs in the unsecured market. Ratings reflect the rating agencies opinions of our financial strength, operating performance,strategic position, and ability to meet our obligations. Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing costs and further constrain our access to the unsecured debt markets and, as a result, would negatively affect our business. Inaddition, downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to any new or replacement financing arrangements, as well as impact elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by theissuing organization. Each agencys rating should be evaluated independently of any other agencys rating.  Theprofitability and financial condition of our operations are heavily dependent upon the performance, operations, and prospects of GM and Chrysler, each of which have recently emerged from bankruptcy protection.  On July 10, 2009, GM completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Motors Liquidation Company (formerly known asGeneral Motors Corporation) and certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. In connection with the sale, all material contracts between GMAC and General Motors Corporation were assumed by Motors Liquidity Company and assigned to General MotorsLLC. GM, GM dealers, and GM-related employees comprise a significant portion of our customer base, and our Global Automotive Finance operations are highly dependent on GM production and sales volume. Furthermore, the Company recently expanded itsfinancing footprint to Chrysler dealers and customers. We have entered into an agreement with Chrysler to provide automotive financing products and services to Chrysler dealers and customers pursuant to which we will be the preferred provider of newwholesale financing for Chrysler dealer inventory. Chrysler has also recently emerged from bankruptcy protection.  Asignificant adverse change in GMs or Chryslers business, including significant adverse changes in their respective liquidity position and access to the capital markets, the production or sale of GM or Chrysler vehicles, the quality orresale value of GM or Chrysler vehicles, the use of GM or Chrysler marketing incentives, GMs or Chryslers relationships with its key suppliers, or GMs or Chryslers relationship with the United Auto Workers and other laborunions and other factors impacting GM or Chrysler or their respective employees could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.  During 2008 and 2009, global vehicle sales declined rapidly, and there is no assurance that the global automotive market or GMs and Chryslers respective share of that market will not suffer asignificant further downturn. Certain U.S. government programs to support vehicle sales were introduced during 2009, but such programs have terminated, and there can be no assurances that similar programs will be implemented in the future, or thatany such programs will be successful if implemented. Vehicle sales volume could be further adversely affected by any additional restructuring activities that GM may decide to pursue, if any. Furthermore, as noted above, both General MotorsCorporation and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy in 2009 and have subsequently emerged from such proceedings. It is difficult to predict with certainty the consequences of these bankruptcy filings and the impact it could have on consumer sentiment andGMs and Chryslers businesses. Any negative impact could in turn have a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations, and financial position.  Our profitability and financial condition have been materially and adversely affected by declines in the residual value of off-lease vehicles, and the residual value of off-lease vehicles may decreasein the future.  Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an automotive lease contract is a criticalelement used to determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketingat lease termination, is less than the expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we incur additional depreciation expense and/or a loss on the lease transaction. General economic conditions, the supply of off-lease vehicles, andnew vehicle market prices heavily influence used vehicle prices and thus the actual residual value of off-lease vehicles. Also contributing to the weakness in the used vehicle market are the historically low consumer confidence levels, whichinfluence major purchases, and the weakening financial condition of auto dealers. During 2008, sharp declines in demand and used vehicle sale prices adversely affected  15 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   GMACs remarketing proceeds for these vehicles, and resulted in impairments totaling $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. Weak residual values also contributedto total loss provisions of $624 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, on our balloon finance contract portfolio.  These trends may continue or worsen. GMs brand image, consumer preference for GM products, and GMs marketing programs that influence the new and used vehicle market for GM vehicles alsoinfluence lease residual values. In the event we determined to increase lease originations related to Chrysler or any other vehicle manufacturer, these same factors would similarly impact related lease residual values. In addition, our ability toefficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles affects the disposal costs and proceeds realized from the vehicle sales. While GM, at times, may provide support for lease residual values including through residual support programs,this support by GM does not in all cases entitle us to full reimbursement for the difference between the remarketing sales proceeds for off-lease vehicles and the residual value specified in the lease contract. Differences between the actualresidual values realized on leased vehicles and our expectations of such values at contract inception could continue to have a negative impact on our profitability and financial condition.  The protracted period of adverse developments in the mortgage finance and credit markets has adversely affected ResCaps business,liquidity, and its capital position and has raised substantial doubt about ResCaps ability to continue as a going concern.  ResCap has been adversely affected by the events and conditions in the broader mortgage banking industry, most severely but not limited to the domestic nonprime and nonconforming and international mortgage loan markets. Fair marketvaluations of held-for-sale mortgage loans, mortgage servicing rights, and securitized interests that continue to be held by ResCap and other assets and liabilities ResCap records at fair value have significantly deteriorated due to continuingweakness in housing prices, increasing mortgage rates, and the severity of delinquencies and defaults of mortgage loans. These deteriorating factors have also resulted in higher provision for loan losses on ResCapsheld-for-investment mortgage loans and real estate-lending portfolios. As a direct result of these events and conditions, ResCap has discontinued new originations in all of its international operations and currently generally only purchases ororiginates mortgage loans that can be sold to one of the U.S. government-sponsored entities (GSEs). If the GSEs became unable or unwilling to purchase mortgage loans from ResCap, it would have a materially adverse impact on ResCaps funding andliquidity.  ResCap is highly leveraged relative to its cash flow and has continued to recognize substantial losses resultingin significant deterioration in capital. There continues to be a risk that ResCap will not be able to meet its debt service obligations, will default on its financial debt covenants due to insufficient capital or liquidity, and/or be in a negativeliquidity position in 2010 or beyond. ResCap remains heavily dependent on GMAC for funding and capital support, and there can be no assurance that GMAC will continue to provide such support.  In light of ResCaps liquidity and capital needs combined with volatile conditions in the marketplace, there is substantial doubt aboutResCaps ability to continue as a going concern. If GMAC determines to no longer support ResCaps capital or liquidity needs or if ResCap or GMAC are unable to successfully execute effective initiatives, it could have a material adverseeffect on ResCaps business, results of operations, and financial position.  There is a significant risk that ResCapwill not be able to meet its debt service obligations and other funding obligations in the near term.  ResCap expects itsliquidity pressures to continue in 2010. ResCap is highly leveraged relative to its cash flow. As of December 31, 2009, ResCaps unrestricted liquidity (cash readily available to cover operating demands from across its businessoperations) totaled $354 million with cash and cash equivalents totaling $765 million.  ResCap expects thatadditional and continuing liquidity pressure, which is difficult to forecast with precision, will result from the obligation of its subsidiaries to advance delinquent principal, interest, property taxes, casualty insurance premiums, and certainother amounts with respect to mortgage loans ResCap services that become delinquent. In addition, ResCap continues to be subject to financial covenants requiring it to maintain minimum consolidated tangible net worth and consolidated liquiditybalances. ResCap will attempt to meet these and other liquidity and capital demands through a combination of cash flow from operations and financings, potential asset sales, and other various alternatives. To the extent these sources proveinsufficient, ResCap will be dependent on continued support from GMAC to the extent GMAC agrees to provide such support. The sufficiency of these sources of additional liquidity cannot be assured, and any asset sales, even if they raise sufficientcash to meet ResCaps liquidity needs, may adversely affect its overall profitability and financial condition.   16 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   Moreover, even if ResCap is successful in implementing all of the actions describedabove, its ability to satisfy its liquidity needs and comply with any covenants included in its debt agreements requiring maintenance of minimum cash balances may be affected by additional factors and events (such as interest rate fluctuations andmargin calls) that increase ResCaps cash needs making ResCap unable to independently satisfy its near-term liquidity requirements.  We have extensive financing and hedging arrangements with ResCap, which could be at risk of nonpayment if ResCap were to file for bankruptcy.  We have secured financing arrangements and secured hedging agreements in place with ResCap. Amounts outstanding under the secured financingand hedging arrangements fluctuate. If ResCap were to file for bankruptcy, ResCaps repayments of its financing facilities, including those with us, will be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and regulations, or ResCap may be unable to repay itsfinancing facilities. In addition, we could be an unsecured creditor of ResCap to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of our collateral are insufficient to repay ResCaps obligations to us. In addition, it is possible that other ResCapcreditors would seek to recharacterize our loans to ResCap as equity contributions or to seek equitable subordination of our claims so that the claims of other creditors would have priority over our claims. We may also find it advantageous toprovide debtor-in-possession financing to ResCap in a bankruptcy proceeding in order to preserve the value of the collateral ResCap has pledged to us. In addition, should ResCap file for bankruptcy, our investment related to ResCaps equityposition would likely be reduced to zero.  Current conditions in the residential mortgage market and housing markets maycontinue to adversely affect GMACs mortgage business.  The residential mortgage market in the United States, Europe,and other international markets in which ResCap conducts business has experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions that adversely affected ResCaps results of operations and financial condition in 2007, 2008, and 2009.Delinquencies and losses with respect to ResCaps nonprime mortgage loans increased significantly and may continue to increase. Housing prices in many parts of the United States, the United Kingdom and other international markets have alsodeclined or stopped appreciating after extended periods of significant appreciation. In addition, the liquidity provided to the mortgage sector has recently been significantly reduced. This liquidity reduction combined with ResCaps decision toreduce its exposure to the nonprime mortgage market caused its nonprime mortgage production to decline, and such declines are expected to continue. Similar trends have emerged beyond the nonprime sector, especially at the lower end of the primecredit quality scale, and have had a similar effect on ResCaps related liquidity needs and businesses in the United States, Europe, and other international markets. These trends have resulted in significant write-downs to ResCapsheld-for-sale mortgage loans and trading securities portfolios and additions to its allowance for loan losses for its held-for-investment mortgage loans and warehouse-lending receivables portfolios. A continuation of these conditions, which weanticipate in the near term, may continue to adversely affect ResCaps financial condition and results of operations.  Moreover, the continued deterioration of the U.S. housing market and decline in home prices in 2007, 2008, and 2009 in many U.S. and international markets, which we anticipate will continue for the near term, are likely to result inincreased delinquencies or defaults on the mortgage assets ResCap owns and services, as well as those mortgage assets owned by Ally Bank. Further, loans that ResCap made based on limited credit or income documentation also increase thelikelihood of future increases in delinquencies or defaults on mortgage loans. An increase in delinquencies or defaults will result in a higher level of credit losses and credit-related expenses and increased liquidity requirements to fund servicingadvances, all of which in turn will reduce revenues and profits of GMACs mortgage business. Higher credit losses and credit-related expenses also could adversely affect our financial condition.  Our lending volume is generally related to the rate of growth in U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding and the size of theU.S. residential mortgage market. Recently, the rate of growth in total U.S. residential mortgage debt outstanding has slowed sharply in response to the reduced activity in the housing market and national declines in home prices. A declinein the rate of growth in mortgage debt outstanding reduces the number of mortgage loans available for us to purchase or securitize, which in turn could lead to a reduction in our revenue, profits, and business prospects.  Our earnings may decrease because of increases or decreases in interest rates.  Changes in interest rates could have an adverse impact on our business. For example:      rising interest rates will increase our cost of funds;   17 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K      rising interest rates may reduce our consumer automotive financing volume by influencing customers to pay cash for, as opposed to financing, vehiclepurchases or not buying new vehicles;      rising interest rates may negatively impact our ability to remarket off-lease vehicles;      rising interest rates generally reduce our residential mortgage loan production as borrowers become less likely to refinance and the costs associatedwith acquiring a new home become more expensive; and      rising interest rates will generally reduce the value of mortgage and automotive financing loans and contracts and retained interests and fixed incomesecurities held in our investment portfolio.  We are also subject to risks from decreasing interest rates.For example, a significant decrease in interest rates could increase the rate at which mortgages are prepaid, which could require us to write down the value of our retained interests and mortgage servicing rights. Moreover, if prepayments aregreater than expected, the cash we receive over the life of our held-for-investment mortgage loans and our retained interests would be reduced. Higher-than-expected prepayments could also reduce the value of our mortgage servicing rights and,to the extent the borrower does not refinance with us, the size of our servicing portfolio. Therefore, any such changes in interest rates could harm our revenues, profitability, and financial condition.  Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could affect ourprofitability and financial condition as could our failure to comply with hedge accounting principles and interpretations.  We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and projections regarding our assets, liabilities,and general market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may experience volatility in our earnings that couldadversely affect our profitability and financial condition.  In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with U.S. generallyaccepted accounting principles requires the application of significant subjective judgments to a body of accounting concepts that is complex and for which the interpretations have continued to evolve within the accounting profession and among thestandard-setting bodies.  A failure of or interruption in the communications and information systems on which we rely toconduct our business could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.  We rely heavily upon communications andinformation systems to conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our information systems or the third-party information systems on which we rely could cause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewer applications beingreceived, slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in servicing. The occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of our assets, in determining our allowance for loan losses, indetermining lease residual values, and in determining our reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospectscould be materially and adversely affected.  We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair value ofmany of our assets, including certain held-for-investment loans for which we elected fair value accounting, retained interests from securitizations of loans and contracts, mortgage servicing rights, and other investments, which do not have anestablished market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates and assumptions in determining our allowance for loan losses on our loan and retail contract portfolios, in determining the residual values of leased vehicles, and indetermining our reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses. It is difficult to determine the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, and our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and assumptions. As anexample, the continued decline of the domestic housing market, especially (but not exclusively) with regard to the nonprime sector, has resulted in increases of the allowance for loan losses at ResCap. A material difference between our estimates andassumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial condition, and business prospects.   18 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   Our business outside the United States exposes us to additional risks that may causeour revenues and profitability to decline.  We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the United Statesexposing us to risks such as the following:      multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to change;      differing local product preferences and product requirements;      fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates;      difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing foreign operations;      differing labor regulations;      consequences from changes in tax laws; and      political and economic instability, natural calamities, war and terrorism.  The effects of these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, affect our revenues and profitability.  Our business could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange rates.  We are exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in currency exchange rates can have asignificant impact on our earnings from international operations as a result of foreign currency translation adjustments. While we carefully watch and attempt to manage our exposure to fluctuation in currency exchange rates, these types of changescan have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  Fluctuations invaluation of investment securities or significant fluctuations in investment market prices could negatively affect revenues.  Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation. Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value that could negatively affect our revenues.Additionally, fluctuations in the value of investment securities available-for-sale could result in unrealized losses recorded in equity. Fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economiccharacteristics of the investee, the relative price of alternative investments, national and international events, and general market conditions.  We may be required to repurchase loans or retail contracts and provide indemnification if we breach representations and warranties from our securitization and whole-loan transactions, which could harmour profitability and financial condition.  When we sell retail contracts or leases through whole-loan sales or securitizeretail contracts, leases, or wholesale loans to dealers, we are required to make representations and warranties about the contracts, leases, or loans to the purchaser or securitization trust. Our whole-loan sale agreements generally require us torepurchase retail contracts or provide indemnification if we breach a representation or warranty given to the purchaser. Likewise, we are required to repurchase retail contracts, leases, or loans and may be required to provide indemnification if webreach a representation or warranty in connection with our securitizations. Similarly, sales of mortgage loans through whole-loan sales or securitizations require us to make representations and warranties about the mortgage loans to the purchaser orsecuritization trust. Our whole-loan sale agreements generally require us to repurchase or substitute loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the purchaser. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result ofborrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its origination. Likewise, we are required to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans if we breach a representation or warranty in connection with our securitizations.Our mortgage repurchase reserve expense for 2009 was $1.5 billion. The remedies available to a purchaser of mortgage loans may be broader than those available to us against the original seller of the mortgage loan. Also, originating brokers andcorrespondent lenders often lack sufficient  19 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   capital to repurchase more than a limited number of such loans, and numerous brokers and correspondents are no longer in business. If a purchaser enforces its remedies against us, we may not beable to enforce the remedies we have against the seller of the mortgage loan to us or the borrower.  Like others in themortgage industry, ResCap has experienced a material increase in repurchase requests. Significant repurchase activity could continue to harm our profitability and financial condition.  Significant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or loan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases or mortgage loanscould harm our profitability and financial condition.  We have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicer insecuritizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive receivable or mortgage loan, the servicer may be required by the servicing provisions to repurchase thatasset from the purchaser or otherwise compensate one or more classes of investors for losses caused by the breach. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets or other payments occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the resultcould be a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.  In connection with itsservicing of securitized mortgage loans, ResCap is subject to contractual caps on the percentage of mortgage loans it is permitted to modify in any securitized pool. The financial crisis has resulted in dramatic increases in the volume of delinquentmortgage loans in 2009. In an effort to achieve the best net present value recovery for the securitization trust, ResCap increased the volume of modifications of distressed mortgage loans to assist homeowners and avoid liquidating properties in acollapsing and opaque housing market. In certain securitization transactions, ResCap has exceeded the applicable contractual modification cap. The securitization documents provide that the contractual caps can be raised or eliminated with theconcurrence of each rating agency rating the transaction. For certain transactions with respect to which loan modifications have exceeded the contractual caps, the rating agencies have concurred in raising or eliminating the caps, but they have notconsented in connection with other such transactions. ResCap will continue to seek their concurrence in connection with other transactions as it deems appropriate, and will suspend modifications in excess of applicable caps pending receipt of suchconsent or investor approval to amend the servicing contracts. An investor in a specific mortgage security class might claim that modifications in excess of the applicable cap amounted to a material failure of ResCap to perform its servicingobligations and that the investor was damaged as a result. Such claims, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations.  A loss of contractual servicing rights could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results ofoperations.  We are the servicer for all of the receivables we have originated and transferred to other parties insecuritizations and whole-loan sales of automotive receivables. Our mortgage subsidiaries service the mortgage loans we have securitized, and we service the majority of the mortgage loans we have sold in whole-loan sales. In each case, we are paid afee for our services, which fees in the aggregate constitute a substantial revenue stream for us. In each case, we are subject to the risk of termination under the circumstances specified in the applicable servicing provisions.  In most securitizations and whole-loan sales, the owner of the receivables or mortgage loans will be entitled to declare a servicer defaultand terminate the servicer upon the occurrence of specified events. These events typically include a bankruptcy of the servicer, a material failure by the servicer to perform its obligations, and a failure by the servicer to turn over funds on therequired basis. The termination of these servicing rights, were it to occur, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations and those of our mortgage subsidiaries.  The regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and earnings.  Our domestic operations are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and restrictionsrelating to supervision and regulation by state and federal authorities. Such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers, not for the benefit of investors in our securities, and could limit ourdiscretion in operating our business. Noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of any license or registration at issue as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.  20 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   GMAC, Ally Bank, and many of our nonbank subsidiaries are heavily regulated by bank andother regulatory agencies at the federal, state, and foreign levels. This regulatory oversight is established to protect depositors, the federal Deposit Insurance Fund, and the banking system as a whole, not security holders. Changes to statutes,regulations, or regulatory policies including interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations, or policies could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including limiting the types of financial services and products we may offerand increasing the ability of nonaffiliates to offer competing financial services and products.  Our operations are alsoheavily regulated in many jurisdictions outside the United States. For example, certain of our foreign subsidiaries operate either as a bank or a regulated finance company, and our insurance operations are subject to various requirements in theforeign markets in which we operate. The varying requirements of these jurisdictions may be inconsistent with U.S. rules and may materially adversely affect our business or limit necessary regulatory approvals, or if approvals are obtained, wemay not be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations. In addition, in many countries the regulations applicable to the financial services industry are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for usto determine the exact regulatory requirements.  In light of current conditions in the U.S. financial markets and economy,regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. For instance, in October 2008, Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which in turn created the TARP and the Capital PurchaseProgram. We are unable to predict how these and any future programs will be administered or implemented in the future, or whether any additional or similar changes to statutes or regulations, including the interpretation or implementation thereof,will occur in the future. Any such action could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We are also affected by the policies adopted byregulatory authorities and bodies of the United States and other governments. For example, the actions of the FRB and international central banking authorities directly impact our cost of funds for lending, capital raising, and investment activitiesand may impact the value of financial instruments we hold. In addition, such changes in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our customers. Changes in domestic and international monetary policy are beyond our control and difficult topredict.  Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have amaterial adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to the affected product and on our reputation generally. No assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will not be amended or construed differently, that new lawsand regulations will not be adopted, or that we will not be prohibited by local laws from raising interest rates above certain desired levels, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results ofoperations.  Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board or other standard-settingbodies may adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, and financial condition.  Our financial statements aresubject to the application of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which are periodically revised and/or expanded. The application of accounting principles is also subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we arerequired to adopt new or revised accounting standards or comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC. Those changes couldadversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition.  The worldwide financial services industryis highly competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully or if there is increased competition in the automotive financing, mortgage, and/or insurance markets or generally in the markets for securitizations or asset sales, our margins could bematerially and adversely affected.  The markets for automotive and mortgage financing, banking, insurance, and reinsuranceare highly competitive. The market for automotive financing has grown more competitive as more consumers are financing their vehicle purchases, primarily in North America and Europe. Our mortgage business and Ally Bank face significant competitionfrom commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage companies, and other financial institutions. Our insurance business faces significant competition from insurance carriers, reinsurers, third-party administrators, brokers, and otherinsurance-related companies. Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors have lower cost structures, lower cost of capital, and are less reliant on securitization andsale activities. We face significant competition in various areas including product offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. This  21 Table of ContentsGMAC Inc.  Form 10-K   competition may increase as we have recently increased pricing on certain lending activities. If we are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we operate, our profitability andfinancial condition could be negatively affected.  GMACs agreements with GM and Chrysler to provide automotive financingproducts to their dealers and customers extend until December and April 2013, respectively. These agreements provide GMAC with certain preferred provider benefits including limiting the use of other financing providers by GM and Chrysler intheir incentive programs. The terms of the GMAC agreement with GM change after December 29, 2010, such that GM will be able to offer any incentive programs on a graduated basis through third parties on a non-exclusive, side-by-side basiswith GMAC, provided that the pricing of the third parties meets certain requirements. Due to the highly competitive nature of the market for financial services, GMAC may be unable to extend one or both of these agreements or may face less favorableterms upon extension. If GMAC is unable to extend one or both of these agreements, its retail and wholesale financing volumes could be negatively impacted.  The markets for asset and mortgage securitizations and whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In addition, lenders andother investors within those markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers, originators, and asset classes, or they may require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased issuance by otherparticipants in the market or decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure to (or to require a higher yield for) us or to automotive or mortgage securitizations or whole loans, could negatively affect our ability and that of oursubsidiaries to price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us.   "
2,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2008-02-27,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
     Because of the following factors, as well as other factors    affecting our operating results and financial condition, past    financial performance should not be considered a reliable    indicator of future performance, and investors should not use    historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future    periods. Risks    Related to Our BusinessRating agencies have recently downgraded their ratings for    GMAC and ResCap, and there could be further downgrades in the    future. Future downgrades would further adversely affect our    ability to raise capital in the debt markets at attractive rates    and increase the interest that we pay on new borrowings, which    could have a material adverse effect on our results of    operations and financial condition.     Each of Standard & Poors Rating Services;    Moodys Investors Service, Inc.; Fitch, Inc.; and    Dominion Bond Rating Service rate our debt. There have been a    series of recent negative credit rating actions, and all of    these agencies currently maintain a negative outlook with    respect to our ratings. Ratings reflect the rating    agencies opinions of our financial strength, operating    performance, strategic position, and ability to meet our    obligations. Agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy,    sell, or hold any security, and may be revised or withdrawn at    any time by the issuing organization. Each agencys rating    should be evaluated independently of any other agencys    rating.     Future downgrades of our credit ratings would further increase    borrowing costs and constrain our access to unsecured debt    markets, including capital markets for retail debt and, as a    result, would negatively affect our business. In addition,    future downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the    possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to    any new or replacement financing arrangements, as well as impact    elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements.     5Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K  Our business requires substantial capital, and if we are    unable to maintain adequate financing sources, our profitability    and financial condition will suffer and jeopardize our ability    to continue operations.     Our liquidity and ongoing profitability are, in large part,    dependent upon our timely access to capital and the costs    associated with raising funds in different segments of the    capital markets. Currently, our primary sources of financing    include public and private securitizations and whole-loan sales.    To a lesser extent, we also use institutional unsecured term    debt, commercial paper, and retail debt offerings. Reliance on    any one source can change going forward.     We depend and will continue to depend on our ability to access    diversified funding alternatives to meet future cash flow    requirements and to continue to fund our operations. Negative    credit events specific to us or our 49% owner, GM, or other    events affecting the overall debt markets have adversely    impacted our funding sources, and continued or additional    negative events could further adversely impact our funding    sources, especially over the long term. As an example, an    insolvency event for GM would curtail our ability to utilize    certain of our automotive wholesale loan securitization    structures as a source of funding in the future. Furthermore,    ResCaps access to capital can be impacted by changes in    the market value of its mortgage products and the willingness of    market participants to provide liquidity for such products.     ResCaps liquidity may also be adversely affected by margin    calls under certain of its secured credit facilities that are    dependent in part on the lenders valuation of the    collateral securing the financing. Each of these credit    facilities allows the lender, to varying degrees, to revalue the    collateral to values that the lender considers to reflect market    values. If a lender determines that the value of the collateral    has decreased, it may initiate a margin call requiring ResCap to    post additional collateral to cover the decrease. When ResCap is    subject to such a margin call, it must provide the lender with    additional collateral or repay a portion of the outstanding    borrowings with minimal notice. Any such margin call could harm    ResCaps liquidity, results of operation, financial    condition, and business prospects. Additionally, in order to    obtain cash to satisfy a margin call, ResCap may be required to    liquidate assets at a disadvantageous time, which could cause it    to incur further losses and adversely affect its results of    operations and financial condition.     Recent developments in the market for many types of mortgage    products (including mortgage-backed securities) have resulted in    reduced liquidity for these assets. Although this reduction in    liquidity has been most acute with regard to nonprime assets,    there has been an overall reduction in liquidity across the    credit spectrum of mortgage products. As a result, ResCaps    liquidity will continue to be negatively impacted by margin    calls and changes to advance rates on its secured facilities.    One consequence of this funding reduction is that ResCap may    decide to retain interests in securitized mortgage pools that,    in other circumstances, it would sell to investors, and ResCap    will have to secure additional financing for these retained    interests. If ResCap is unable to secure sufficient financing    for them or if there is further general deterioration of    liquidity for mortgage products, it will adversely impact    ResCaps business. In addition, a number of ResCaps    financing facilities have relatively short terms, typically one    year or less, and a number of facilities are scheduled to mature    during 2008. Though ResCap has generally been able to renew    maturing facilities when needed to fund its operations, in    recent months counterparties have often negotiated more    conservative terms. Such terms have included, among other    things, shorter maturities upon renewal, lower overall borrowing    limits, lower ratios of funding to collateral value for secured    facilities, and higher borrowing costs. There can be no    assurance that ResCap will be able to renew maturing credit    facilities on favorable terms, or at all. If ResCap is unable to    maintain adequate financing or if other sources of capital are    not available, it could be forced to suspend, curtail, or reduce    certain aspects of its operations, which could harm    ResCaps revenues, profitability, financial condition, and    business prospects.     Furthermore, we utilize asset and mortgage securitizations and    sales as a critical component of our diversified funding    strategy. Several factors could affect our ability to complete    securitizations and sales, including conditions in the    securities markets generally, conditions in the asset- or    mortgage-backed securities markets, the credit quality and    performance of our contracts and loans, our ability to service    our contracts and loans, and a decline in the ratings given to    securities previously issued in our securitizations. Any of    these factors could negatively affect our ability to fund in    these markets and the pricing of our securitizations and sales,    resulting in lower proceeds from these activities. Recent developments in the residential mortgage market may    continue to adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and    financial condition.     Recently, the residential mortgage markets in the United States    and Europe have experienced a variety of difficulties and    changed economic conditions that adversely affected our earnings    and financial condition in the fourth quarter of 2006 and    through 2007. Delinquencies and losses with respect to    ResCaps nonprime mortgage loans increased significantly    and may continue to increase. Housing prices in many parts of    the United States and the United Kingdom have also declined or    stopped appreciating, after extended periods of significant    appreciation. In addition, the liquidity provided to the    mortgage sector has recently been significantly reduced. This    liquidity reduction combined with ResCaps decision to    6Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K      reduce its exposure to the nonprime mortgage market caused its    nonprime mortgage production to decline, and such declines may    continue. Similar trends are emerging beyond the nonprime    sector, especially at the lower end of the prime credit quality    scale, and may have a similar effect on ResCaps related    liquidity needs and businesses in the United States and Europe.    These trends have resulted in significant write-downs to    ResCaps mortgage loans held for sale portfolio and    additions to allowance for loan losses for its mortgage loans    held for investment and warehouse lending receivables    portfolios. A continuation of these trends may continue to    adversely affect our financial condition and results of    operations.     Another factor that may result in higher delinquency rates on    mortgage loans held for sale and investment and on mortgage    loans that underlie interests from securitizations is the    scheduled increase in monthly payments on adjustable rate    mortgage loans. Borrowers with adjustable rate mortgage loans    are being exposed to increased monthly payments when the related    mortgage interest rate adjusts upward under the terms of the    mortgage loan from the initial fixed rate or a low introductory    rate, as applicable, to the rate computed in accordance with the    applicable index and margin. This increase in borrowers    monthly payments, together with any increase in prevailing    market interest rates, may result in significantly increased    monthly payments for borrowers with adjustable rate mortgage    loans.     Borrowers seeking to avoid these increased monthly payments by    refinancing their mortgage loans may no longer be able to find    available replacement loans at comparably low interest rates. A    decline in housing prices may also leave borrowers with    insufficient equity in their homes to permit them to refinance.    In addition, these mortgage loans may have prepayment premiums    that inhibit refinancing. Furthermore, borrowers who intend to    sell their homes on or before the expiration of the fixed-rate    periods on their mortgage loans may find that they cannot sell    their properties for an amount equal to or greater than the    unpaid principal balance of their loans. These events, alone or    in combination, may contribute to higher delinquency rates.     Certain government regulators have observed these issues    involving nonprime mortgages and have indicated an intention to    review the mortgage loan programs. To the extent that regulators    restrict the volume, terms,    and/or type    of nonprime mortgage loans, the liquidity of our nonprime    mortgage loan production and our profitability from nonprime    mortgage loans could be negatively impacted. Such activity could    also negatively impact our warehouse lending volumes and    profitability.     The events surrounding the nonprime segment have forced certain    originators to exit the market. Such activities may limit the    volume of nonprime mortgage loans available for us to acquire    and/or our    warehouse lending volumes, which could negatively impact our    profitability.     These events, alone or in combination, may contribute to higher    delinquency rates, reduce origination volumes, or reduce    warehouse lending volumes at ResCap. These events could    adversely affect our revenues, profitability, and financial    condition. Recent negative developments in the secondary mortgage    markets have led credit rating agencies to make requirements for    rating mortgage securities more stringent, and market    participants are still evaluating the impact.     The credit rating agencies that rate most classes of    ResCaps mortgage securitization transactions establish    criteria for both security terms and the underlying mortgage    loans. Recent deterioration in the residential mortgage market    in the United States and internationally, especially in the    nonprime sector, has led the rating agencies to increase their    required credit enhancement for certain loan features and    security structures. These changes, and any similar changes in    the future, may reduce the volume of securitizable loans ResCap    is able to produce in a competitive market. Similarly, increased    credit enhancement to support ratings on new securities may    reduce the profitability of ResCaps mortgage    securitization operations and, accordingly, its overall    profitability and financial condition. Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant and    could materially adversely affect our business.     We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of    December 31, 2007, we had approximately $193 billion    in principal amount of indebtedness outstanding. Interest    expense on our indebtedness constitutes approximately 70% of our    total financing revenues. In addition, under the terms of our    current indebtedness, we have the ability to create additional    unsecured indebtedness. If our debt payments increase, whether    due to the increased cost of existing indebtedness or the    incurrence of additional indebtedness, we may be required to    dedicate a significant portion of our cash flow from operations    to the payment of principal of, and interest on, our    indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for other    purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability to    withstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility in    responding to changing business and economic conditions. The profitability and financial condition of our operations    are dependent upon the operations of General Motors    Corporation.     A significant portion of our customers are those of GM, GM    dealers, and GM-related employees. As a result, various aspects    of GMs business, including changes in the    7Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K      production or sale of GM vehicles, the quality or resale value    of GM vehicles, the use of GM marketing incentives, GMs    relationships with its key suppliers, the United Auto Workers    and other labor unions, and other factors impacting GM or its    employees could significantly affect our profitability and    financial condition.     We provide vehicle financing through purchases of retail    automotive and lease contracts with retail customers of    primarily GM dealers. We also finance the purchase of new and    used vehicles by GM dealers through wholesale financing, extend    other financing to GM dealers, provide fleet financing for GM    dealers to buy vehicles they rent or lease to others, provide    wholesale vehicle inventory insurance to GM dealers, provide    automotive extended service contracts through GM dealers, and    offer other services to GM dealers. In 2007, our shares of GM    retail sales and sales to dealers were 35% and 82%,    respectively, in markets where GM operates. As a result,    GMs level of automobile production and sales directly    impacts our financing and leasing volume, the premium revenue    for wholesale vehicle inventory insurance, the volume of    automotive extended service contracts, and the profitability and    financial condition of the GM dealers to whom we provide    wholesale financing, term loans, and fleet financing. In    addition, the quality of GM vehicles affects our obligations    under automotive extended service contracts relating to such    vehicles. Further, the resale value of GM vehicles, which may be    impacted by various factors relating to GMs business such    as brand image or the number of new GM vehicles produced,    affects the remarketing proceeds we receive upon the sale of    repossessed vehicles and off-lease vehicles at lease termination.     GM utilizes various rate, residual value, and other financing    incentives from time to time. The nature, timing, and extent of    GMs use of incentives has a significant impact on our    consumer automotive financing volume and our share of GMs    retail sales, which we refer to as our penetration level. For    example, GM held a    72-hour    promotion during July 2006 in which we offered retail contracts    at 0% financing for 72 months. Primarily because of this    promotion, we experienced a significant increase in our consumer    automotive financing penetration levels during the third quarter    of 2006. GM has provided financial assistance and incentives to    its franchised dealers through guarantees, agreements to    repurchase inventory, equity investments, and subsidies that    assist dealers in making interest payments to financing sources.    These financial assistance and incentive programs are provided    at the option of GM, and they may be terminated in whole or in    part at any time. While the financial assistance and incentives    do not relieve the dealers from their obligations to us or their    other financing sources, if GM were to reduce or terminate any    of their financial assistance and incentive programs, the timing    and amount of payments from GM-franchised dealers to us may be    adversely affected. We have substantial credit exposure to General Motors    Corporation.     We have entered into various operating and financing    arrangements with GM. As a result of these arrangements, we have    substantial credit exposure to GM. However, as part of the Sale    Transactions, this credit exposure has been reduced because of    the termination of various intercompany credit facilities. In    addition, certain unsecured exposure to GM entities in the    United States has been contractually capped at $1.5 billion    (actual exposure of $514 million at December 31, 2007).     As a marketing incentive GM may sponsor residual support    programs for retail leases as a way to lower customers    monthly payments. Under residual support programs, the    contractual residual value is adjusted above GMACs    standard residual rates. At lease origination, GM pays us the    present value of the estimated amount of residual support it    expects to owe at lease termination. When the lease terminates,    GM makes a    true-up    payment to us if the estimated residual support payment is too    low. Similarly, we make a    true-up    payment to GM if the estimated residual payment is too high and    GM overpaid GMAC. Additionally, under what we refer to as lease    pull-ahead programs, customers are encouraged to    terminate leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a    new GM vehicle. As part of these programs, we waive all or a    portion of the customers remaining payment obligation    under the current lease. Under most programs, GM compensates us    for the foregone revenue from the waived payments. Since these    programs generally accelerate our remarketing of the vehicle,    the resale proceeds are typically higher than otherwise would    have been realized had the vehicle been remarketed at lease    contract maturity. The reimbursement from GM for the foregone    payments is, therefore, reduced by the amount of this benefit.    GM makes estimated payments to us at the end of each month in    which customers have pulled their leases ahead. As with residual    support payments, these estimates are trued-up once all the    vehicles that could have been pulled ahead have terminated and    been remarketed. To the extent that the original estimates were    incorrect, GM or GMAC may be obligated to pay each other the    difference, as appropriate under the lease pull-ahead programs.    GM is also responsible for risk sharing on returned lease    vehicles in the United States and Canada whose resale proceeds    are below standard residual values (limited to a floor). In    addition, GM may sponsor rate support programs, which offer    rates to customers below the standard market rates at which we    purchase retail contracts (such as 0% financing). Under rate    support programs, GM is obligated to pay us the present value of    the difference between the customer rate and our standard rates.    The amount of this payment is determined on    8Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K      a monthly basis based on subvented contract originations in a    given month, and payment for GMs rate support obligation    is due to us on the    15th    of each following month.     Historically GM has made all payments related to these programs    and arrangements on a timely basis. However, if GM is unable to    pay, fails to pay, or is delayed in paying these amounts, our    profitability, financial condition, and cash flow could be    adversely affected. Our earnings may decrease because of increases or decreases    in interest rates.     Our profitability is directly affected by changes in interest    rates. The following are some of the risks we face relating to    an increase in interest rates:       Rising interest rates will increase our cost of funds.       Rising interest rates may reduce our consumer automotive    financing volume by influencing consumers to pay cash for, as    opposed to financing, vehicle purchases.       Rising interest rates generally reduce our residential mortgage    loan production as borrowers become less likely to refinance,    and the costs associated with acquiring a new home becomes more    expensive.       Rising interest rates will generally reduce the value of    mortgage and automotive financing loans and contracts and    retained interests and fixed income securities held in our    investment portfolio.     We are also subject to risks from decreasing interest rates. For    example, a significant decrease in interest rates could increase    the rate at which mortgages are prepaid, which could require us    to write down the value of our retained interests. Moreover, if    prepayments are greater than expected, the cash we receive over    the life of our mortgage loans held for investment, and our    retained interests would be reduced. Higher-than-expected    prepayments could also reduce the value of our mortgage    servicing rights and, to the extent the borrower does not    refinance with us, the size of our servicing portfolio.    Therefore, any such changes in interest rates could harm our    revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigating    our risks associated with changes in interest rates and could    affect our profitability and financial condition, as could our    failure to comply with hedge accounting principles and    interpretations.     We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the    interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets    and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and    projections regarding our assets, liabilities, and general    market factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be    incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of    changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may    experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely    affect our profitability and financial condition.     In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS 133    requires the application of significant subjective judgments to    a body of accounting concepts that is complex and for which the    interpretations have continued to evolve within the accounting    profession and amongst the standard-setting bodies. On our 2006    Form 10-K,    we restated prior period financial information to eliminate    hedge accounting treatment that had been applied to certain    callable debt hedged with derivatives. Our residential mortgage subsidiarys ability to pay    dividends to us is restricted by contractual arrangements.     On June 24, 2005, we entered into an operating agreement    with GM and ResCap, the holding company for our residential    mortgage business, to create separation between GM and us on the    one hand, and ResCap, on the other. The operating agreement    restricts ResCaps ability to declare dividends or prepay    subordinated indebtedness to us. This operating agreement was    amended on November 27, 2006, and again on    November 30, 2006, in conjunction with the Sale    Transactions. Among other things, these amendments removed GM as    a party to the agreement.     The restrictions contained in the ResCap operating agreement    include the requirements that ResCaps total equity be at    least $6.5 billion for dividends to be paid. If ResCap is    permitted to pay dividends pursuant to the previous sentence,    the cumulative amount of such dividends may not exceed 50% of    ResCaps cumulative net income (excluding payments for    income taxes from our election for federal income tax purposes    to be treated as a limited liability company), measured from    July 1, 2005, at the time such dividend is paid. These    restrictions will cease to be effective if ResCaps total    equity has been at least $12 billion as of the end of each    of two consecutive fiscal quarters or if we cease to be the    majority owner. In connection with the Sale Transactions, GM was    released as a party to this operating agreement, but the    operating agreement remains in effect between ResCap and us. At    December 31, 2007, ResCap had consolidated total equity of    approximately $6.0 billion. A failure of or interruption in the communications and    information systems on which we rely to conduct our business    could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.     We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to    conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our    information systems or the third-party information systems on    which we rely could cause underwriting or other delays and could    result in fewer applications being received,    9Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K      slower processing of applications, and reduced efficiency in    servicing. The occurrence of any of these events could have a    material adverse effect on our business. We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fair    value of certain of our assets, in determining our allowance for    credit losses, in determining lease residual values, and in    determining our reserves for insurance losses and loss    adjustment expenses. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be    incorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition,    and business prospects could be materially adversely    affected.     We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair    value of many of our assets, including retained interests from    securitizations of loans and contracts, mortgage servicing    rights, and other investments, which do not have an established    market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates    and assumptions in determining our allowance for credit losses    on our loan and contract portfolios, in determining the residual    values of leased vehicles, and in determining our reserves for    insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses. It is difficult    to determine the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, and    our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates    and assumptions. As an example, the continued decline of the    domestic housing market, especially (but not exclusively) with    regard to the nonprime sector, has resulted in increases of the    allowance for loan losses at ResCap for 2006 and 2007. A    material difference between our estimates and assumptions and    our actual experience may adversely affect our cash flow,    profitability, financial condition, and business prospects. Our business outside the United States exposes us to    additional risks that may cause our revenues and profitability    to decline.     We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the    United States. We intend to continue to pursue growth    opportunities for our businesses outside the United States,    which could expose us to greater risks. The risks associated    with our operations outside the United States include:       multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to    change;       differing local product preferences and product requirements;       fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest    rates;       difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing foreign    operations;       differing labor regulations;       consequences from changes in tax laws; and       political and economic instability, natural calamities, war, and    terrorism.     The effects of these risks may, individually or in the    aggregate, adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our business could be adversely affected by changes in    currency exchange rates.     We are exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in    foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in currency exchange    rates can have a significant impact on our earnings from    international operations. While we carefully watch and attempt    to manage our exposure to fluctuation in currency exchange    rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects    on our business and results of operations and financial    condition. We are exposed to credit risk, which could affect our    profitability and financial condition.     We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment    or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well    as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we    retain a residual interest. For example, the continued decline    in the domestic housing market has resulted in an increase in    delinquency rates related to mortgage loans that ResCap either    holds or retains an interest in. Furthermore, a weak economic    environment caused by higher energy prices and the continued    deterioration of the housing market could exert pressure on our    consumer automotive finance customers resulting in higher    delinquencies, repossessions, and losses. There can be no    assurances that our monitoring of our credit risk as it impacts    the value of these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit    risk through our risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting    policies, and loss mitigation strategies are or will be    sufficient to prevent a further adverse effect on our    profitability and financial condition. As part of the    underwriting process, we rely heavily upon information supplied    by third parties. If any of this information is intentionally or    negligently misrepresented and the misrepresentation is not    detected before completing the transaction, the credit risk    associated with the transaction may be increased. General business and economic conditions of the industries    and geographic areas in which we operate affect our revenues,    profitability, and financial condition.     Our revenues, profitability, and financial condition are    sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the    United States and in the markets in which we operate outside the    United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in    increased unemployment rates, increased    10Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K      consumer and commercial bankruptcy filings, or other factors    that negatively impact household incomes could decrease demand    for our financing and mortgage products and increase delinquency    and loss. In addition, because our credit exposures are    generally collateralized, the severity of losses is particularly    sensitive to a decline in used vehicle and residential home    prices.     Some further examples of these risks include the following:       A significant and sustained increase in gasoline prices could    decrease new and used vehicle purchases, thereby reducing the    demand for automotive retail and wholesale financing.       A general decline in residential home prices in the United    States could negatively affect the value of our mortgage loans    held for investment and sale and our retained interests in    securitized mortgage loans. Such a decrease could also restrict    our ability to originate, sell or securitize mortgage loans, and    impact the repayment of advances under our warehouse loans.       An increase in automotive labor rates or parts prices could    negatively affect the value of our automotive extended service    contracts. Our profitability and financial condition may be materially    adversely affected by decreases in the residual value of    off-lease vehicles.     Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an    automotive lease contract is a critical element used to    determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at    the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent    the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the    sales proceeds received upon remarketing, is less than the    expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we    incur additional depreciation expense and/or a loss on the lease    transaction. General economic conditions, the supply of    off-lease vehicles, and new vehicle market prices heavily    influence used vehicle prices and thus the actual residual value    of off-lease vehicles. GMs brand image, consumer    preference for GM products, and GMs marketing programs    that influence the new and used vehicle market for GM vehicles    also influence lease residual values. In addition, our ability    to efficiently process and effectively market off-lease vehicles    impacts the disposal costs and proceeds realized from the    vehicle sales. While GM provides support for lease residual    values, including through residual support programs, this    support by GM does not in all cases entitle us to full    reimbursement for the difference between the remarketing sales    proceeds for off-lease vehicles and the residual value specified    in the lease contract. Differences between the actual residual    values realized on leased vehicles and our expectations of such    values at contract inception could have a negative impact on our    profitability and financial condition. Fluctuations in valuation of investment securities or    significant fluctuations in investment market prices could    negatively affect revenues.     Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation.    Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an    investment may significantly differ from the reported market    value that could negatively affect our revenues. Fluctuation in    the market price of a security may result from perceived changes    in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the    relative price of alternative investments, national and    international events, and general market conditions. Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage    programs, or disruptions in the secondary markets in the United    States or in other countries in which our mortgage subsidiaries    operate, could adversely affect the profitability and financial    condition of our mortgage business.     The ability of ResCap to generate revenue through mortgage loan    sales to institutional investors in the United States depends to    a significant degree on programs administered by    government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Freddie    Mac, Ginnie Mae, and others that facilitate the issuance of    mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These    government-sponsored enterprises play a powerful role in the    residential mortgage industry, and our mortgage subsidiaries    have significant business relationships with them. Proposals are    being considered in Congress and by various regulatory    authorities that would affect the manner in which these    government-sponsored enterprises conduct their business,    including proposals to establish a new independent agency to    regulate the government-sponsored enterprises, to require them    to register their stock with the SEC, to reduce or limit certain    business benefits they receive from the U.S. government,    and to limit the size of the mortgage loan portfolios they may    hold. Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the    operation of these government-sponsored enterprises could    adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Also, any    significant adverse change in the level of activity in the    secondary market, including declines in the institutional    investors desire to invest in our mortgage products, could    adversely affect our business.    11Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K  We may be required to repurchase contracts and provide    indemnification if we breach representations and warranties from    our securitization and whole-loan transactions, which could harm    our profitability and financial condition.     When we sell retail contracts or leases through whole-loan sales    or securitize retail contracts, leases, or wholesale loans to    dealers, we are required to make customary representations and    warranties about the contracts, leases, or loans to the    purchaser or securitization trust. Our whole-loan sale    agreements generally require us to repurchase retail contracts    or provide indemnification if we breach a representation or    warranty given to the purchaser. Likewise, we are required to    repurchase retail contracts, leases, or loans and may be    required to provide indemnification if we breach a    representation or warranty in connection with our    securitizations. Similarly, sales of mortgage loans through    whole-loan sales or securitizations require us to make customary    representations and warranties about the mortgage loans to the    purchaser or securitization trust. Our whole-loan sale    agreements generally require us to repurchase or substitute    loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the    purchaser. In addition, we may be required to repurchase    mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment    default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its origination.    Likewise, we are required to repurchase or substitute mortgage    loans if we breach a representation or warranty in connection    with our securitizations. The remedies available to a purchaser    of mortgage loans may be broader than those available to us    against the original seller of the mortgage loan. Also,    originating brokers and correspondent lenders often lack    sufficient capital to repurchase more than a limited number of    such loans and numerous brokers and correspondents are no longer    in business. If a purchaser enforces its remedies against us, we    may not be able to enforce the remedies we have against the    seller of the mortgage loan to us or the borrower.     Like others in the mortgage industry, ResCap has experienced a    material increase in repurchase requests. Significant repurchase    activity could continue to harm our profitability and financial    condition. Significant indemnification payments or contract, lease, or    loan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases or    mortgage loans could harm our profitability and financial    condition.     We have repurchase obligations in our capacity as servicers in    securitizations and whole-loan sales. If a servicer breaches a    representation, warranty, or servicing covenant with respect to    an automotive receivable or mortgage loan, the servicer may be    required by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset    from the purchaser. If the frequency at which repurchases of    assets occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the    result could be a material adverse effect on our financial    condition, liquidity, and results of operations. A loss of contractual servicing rights could have a material    adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and    results of operations.     We are the servicer for all of the receivables we have    originated and transferred to other parties in securitizations    and whole-loan sales of automotive receivables. Our mortgage    subsidiaries service the mortgage loans we have securitized, and    we service the majority of the mortgage loans we have sold in    whole-loan sales. In each case, we are paid a fee for our    services, which fees in the aggregate constitute a substantial    revenue stream for us. In each case, we are subject to the risk    of termination under the circumstances specified in the    applicable servicing provisions.     In most securitizations and whole-loan sales, the owner of the    receivables or mortgage loans will be entitled to declare a    servicer default and terminate the servicer upon the occurrence    of specified events. These events typically include a bankruptcy    of the servicer, a material failure by the servicer to perform    its obligations, and a failure by the servicer to turn over    funds on the required basis. The termination of these servicing    rights, were it to occur, could have a material adverse effect    on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations    and those of our mortgage subsidiaries. For the year ended    December 31, 2007, our consolidated mortgage servicing fee    income was approximately $2.2 billion. The regulatory environment in which we operate could have a    material adverse effect on our business and earnings.     Our domestic operations are subject to various laws and judicial    and administrative decisions imposing various requirements and    restrictions relating to supervision and regulation by state and    federal authorities. Such regulation and supervision are    primarily for the benefit and protection of our customers, not    for the benefit of investors in our securities, and could limit    our discretion in operating our business. Noncompliance with    applicable statutes or regulations could result in the    suspension or revocation of any license or registration at    issue, as well as the imposition of civil fines and criminal    penalties.     Our operations are also heavily regulated in many jurisdictions    outside the United States. For example, certain of our foreign    subsidiaries operate either as a bank or a regulated finance    company, and our insurance operations are subject to various    requirements in the foreign markets in which we operate. The    varying requirements of these jurisdictions may be inconsistent    with U.S. rules and may materially adversely affect our    business or limit necessary    12Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K      regulatory approvals, or if approvals are obtained, we may not    be able to continue to comply with the terms of the approvals or    applicable regulations. In addition, in many countries the    regulations applicable to the financial services industry are    uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult for us to    determine the exact regulatory requirements.     Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory    requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material    adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to    the affected product and on our reputation generally. No    assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will    not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and    regulations will not be adopted, or that we will not be    prohibited by local laws from raising interest rates above    certain desired levels, any of which could materially adversely    affect our business, financial condition, or results of    operations. Changes in accounting standards issued by the Financial    Accounting Standards Board or other standard-setting bodies may    adversely affect our reported revenues, profitability, and    financial condition.     Our financial statements are subject to the application of    U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, which are    periodically revised    and/or    expanded. The application of accounting principles is also    subject to varying interpretations over time. Accordingly, we    are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or    comply with revised interpretations that are issued from time to    time by recognized authoritative bodies, including the Financial    Accounting Standards Board and the U.S. Securities and    Exchange Commission. Those changes could adversely affect our    reported revenues, profitability, or financial condition. The worldwide financial services industry is highly    competitive. If we are unable to compete successfully or if    there is increased competition in the automotive financing,    mortgage,    and/or    insurance markets or generally in the markets for    securitizations or asset sales, our margins could be materially    adversely affected.     The markets for automotive and mortgage financing, insurance,    and reinsurance are highly competitive. The market for    automotive financing has grown more competitive as more    consumers are financing their vehicle purchases, primarily in    North America and Europe. Our mortgage business faces    significant competition from commercial banks, savings    institutions, mortgage companies, and other financial    institutions. Our insurance business faces significant    competition from insurance carriers, reinsurers, third-party    administrators, brokers, and other insurance-related companies.    Many of our competitors have substantial positions nationally or    in the markets in which they operate. Some of our competitors    have lower cost structures, lower cost of capital, and are less    reliant on securitization and sale activities. We face    significant competition in various areas, including product    offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. If we    are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we    operate, our profitability and financial condition could be    negatively affected.     The markets for asset and mortgage securitizations and    whole-loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and    originators could increase the amount of their issuances and    sales. In addition, lenders and other investors within those    markets often establish limits on their credit exposure to    particular issuers, originators and asset classes, or they may    require higher returns to increase the amount of their exposure.    Increased issuance by other participants in the market, or    decisions by investors to limit their credit exposure    to  or to require a higher yield for  us    or to automotive or mortgage securitizations or whole loans,    could negatively affect our ability and that of our subsidiaries    to price our securitizations and whole-loan sales at attractive    rates. The result would be lower proceeds from these activities    and lower profits for our subsidiaries and us. Certain of our owners are subject to a regulatory agreement    that may affect our control of GMAC Bank.     On February 1, 2007, Cerberus FIM, LLC, Cerberus FIM    Investors LLC and FIM Holdings LLC (collectively, FIM    Entities), submitted a letter to the FDIC requesting that    the FDIC waive certain of the requirements contained in a    two-year disposition agreement between each of the FIM Entities    and the FDIC. The agreement was entered into in connection with    the sale by General Motors of a 51% interest in us. The sale    resulted in a change of control of GMAC Bank, an industrial loan    corporation, which required the approval of the FDIC. At the    time of the sale, the FDIC had imposed a moratorium on the    approval of any applications for deposit insurance or change of    control notices. As a condition to granting the application in    connection with the change of control of GMAC Bank during the    moratorium, the FDIC required each of the FIM Entities to enter    into a two-year disposition agreement. As previously disclosed    by the FDIC, that agreement requires, among other things, that    by no later than November 30, 2008, the FIM Entities    complete one of the following actions: (1) become    registered with the appropriate federal banking agency as a    depository institution holding company pursuant to the Bank    Holding Company Act or the Home Owners Loan Act,    (2) divest control of GMAC Bank to one or more persons or    entities other than prohibited transferees, (3) terminate    GMAC Banks status as an FDIC-insured depository    institution, or (4) obtain from the FDIC a waiver of the    requirements set forth in this sentence on the ground that    applicable law and FDIC policy permit similarly situated    companies to acquire control of FDIC-    13Table of ContentsGMAC    LLC  Form 10-K      insured industrial banks; provided that no waiver request could    be filed prior to January 31, 2008, unless, prior to that    date, Congress enacted legislation permitting, or the FDIC by    regulation or order authorizes, similarly situated companies to    acquire control of FDIC-insured industrial banks after    January 31, 2007. We cannot give any assurance that the    FDIC will approve the FIM Entities waiver request or, if    it is approved, that it will impose no conditions on our    retention of GMAC Bank or on its operations. However, it is    worth noting that the House of Representatives has passed a bill    that would permit the FIM Entities to continue to own GMAC Bank.    The Senate Banking Committee has approved a bill that would have    the same effect. If the FDIC does not approve the waiver, we    could be required to sell GMAC Bank or cause it to cease to be    insured by the FDIC, or we could be subject to conditions on our    retention of the bank or on its operations in return for the    waiver. Requiring us to dispose of GMAC Bank or relinquish    deposit insurance would, and the imposition of such conditions    might, materially adversely affect our access to low cost    liquidity and our business and operating results. "
0,ALLY,ALLY FINANCIAL INC,2007-03-13,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
    Because of the following factors, as well as other factors    affecting our operating results and financial condition, past    financial performance should not be considered a reliable    indicator of future performance, and investors should not use    historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future    periods. Risks Related to    Our BusinessRating agencies    may downgrade their ratings for GMAC or ResCap in the future,    which would adversely affect our ability to raise capital in the    debt markets at attractive rates and increase the interest that    we pay on our outstanding publicly traded notes, which could    have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and    financial condition.     Substantially all of our unsecured debt has been rated by four    nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.    Commencing late in 2001, concerns over the competitive and    financial strength of GM, including whether it would experience    a labor interruption and how it would fund its health care    liabilities, resulted in a series of credit rating actions on    our unsecured debt concurrent with a series of credit actions    that downgraded the credit rating on GMs debt. As a    result, our unsecured borrowing spreads widened significantly    over the past several years substantially reducing our access to    the unsecured debt markets and impacting our overall cost of    borrowing.     Future downgrades of our credit ratings would increase borrowing    costs and further constrain our access to unsecured debt    markets, including capital markets for retail debt, and as a    result, would negatively affect our business. In addition,    future downgrades of our credit ratings could increase the    possibility of additional terms and conditions being added to    any new or replacement financing arrangements, as well as impact    elements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements. Our business    requires substantial capital, and if we are unable to maintain    adequate financing sources, our profitability and financial    condition will suffer and jeopardize our ability to continue    operations.     Our liquidity and ongoing profitability are, in large part,    dependent upon our timely access to capital and the costs    associated with raising funds in different segments of the    capital markets. Currently, our primary sources of financing    include public and private securitizations and whole loan sales.    To a lesser extent, we also use institutional unsecured term    debt, commercial paper and retail debt offerings. Reliance on    any one source can change going forward.     We depend and will continue to depend on our ability to access    diversified funding alternatives to meet future cash flow    requirements and to continue to fund our operations. Negative    credit events specific to us or our 49% owner, GM, or other    events affecting the overall debt markets have adversely    impacted our funding sources, and continued or additional    negative events could further adversely impact our funding    sources, especially over the long term. As an example, an    insolvency event for GM would curtail our ability to utilize    certain of our automotive wholesale loan4    Table of Contents GMAC    LLC  Form 10-K     securitization structures as a source of funding in the future.    Furthermore, ResCaps access to capital can be impacted by    changes in the market value of its mortgage products and the    willingness of market participants to provide liquidity for such    products. If we are unable to maintain adequate financing or if    other sources of capital are not available, we could be forced    to suspend, curtail or reduce certain aspects of our operations,    which could harm our revenues, profitability, financial    condition and business prospects.     Furthermore, we utilize asset and mortgage securitizations and    sales as a critical component of our diversified funding    strategy. Several factors could affect our ability to complete    securitizations and sales, including conditions in the    securities markets generally, conditions in the asset-backed or    mortgage-backed securities markets, the credit quality and    performance of our contracts and loans, our ability to service    our contracts and loans and a decline in the ratings given to    securities previously issued in our securitizations. Any of    these factors could negatively affect the pricing of our    securitizations and sales, resulting in lower proceeds from    these activities.     Within this    Form 10-K,    we have restated prior period financial information to eliminate    hedge accounting treatment that had been applied to certain    callable debt hedged with derivatives. As a result, it is    possible that some of our lenders under certain of our liquidity    facilities could claim that they are not obligated to honor    their lending commitments. We believe that any such claim would    not be sustainable. Renewal and revision of these facilities is    imminent, which likely will eliminate the issue. There can be no    assurance that we are correct in our assessments. If we are not,    available funding under certain of our liquidity facilities    could be adversely impacted. Our indebtedness    and other obligations are significant and could materially    adversely affect our business.     We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of    December 31, 2006, we had approximately    $237 billion in principal amount of indebtedness    outstanding. Interest expense on our indebtedness constitutes    approximately 67% of our total financing revenues. In addition,    under the terms of our current indebtedness, we have the ability    to create additional unsecured indebtedness. If our debt    payments increase, whether due to the increased cost of existing    indebtedness or the incurrence of additional indebtedness, we    may be required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash    flow from operations to the payment of principal of, and    interest on, our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds    available for other purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit    our ability to withstand competitive pressures and reduce our    flexibility in responding to changing business and economic    conditions. The profitability    and financial condition of our operations are dependent upon the    operations of General Motors Corporation.     A significant portion of our customers are those of GM, GM    dealers and GM related employees. As a result, various aspects    of GMs business, including changes in the production or    sale of GM vehicles, the quality or resale value of GM vehicles,    the use of GM marketing incentives and other factors impacting    GM or its employees could significantly affect our profitability    and financial condition.     We provide vehicle financing through purchases of retail    automotive and lease contracts with retail customers of    primarily GM dealers. We also finance the purchase of new and    used vehicles by GM dealers through wholesale financing, extend    other financing to GM dealers, provide fleet financing for GM    dealers to buy vehicles they rent or lease to others, provide    wholesale vehicle inventory insurance to GM dealers, provide    automotive extended service contracts through GM dealers and    offer other services to GM dealers. In 2006 our shares of GM    retail sales and sales to dealers were 38% and 80%,    respectively, in markets where GM operates. As a result,    GMs level of automobile production and sales directly    impacts our financing and leasing volume, the premium revenue    for wholesale vehicle inventory insurance, the volume of    automotive extended service contracts and the profitability and    financial condition of the GM dealers to whom we provide    wholesale financing, term loans and fleet financing. In    addition, the quality of GM vehicles affects our obligations    under automotive extended service contracts relating to such    vehicles. Further, the resale value of GM vehicles, which may be    impacted by various factors relating to GMs business such    as brand image or the number of new GM vehicles produced,    affects the remarketing proceeds we receive upon the sale of    repossessed vehicles and off-lease vehicles at lease termination.     GM utilizes various rate, residual value and other financing    incentives from time to time. The nature, timing and extent of    GMs use of incentives has a significant impact on our    consumer automotive financing volume and our share of GMs    retail sales, which we refer to as our penetration level. For    example, GM held a 72 hour promotion during July 2006 in    which we offered retail contracts at 0% financing for    72 months. Primarily as a result of this promotion, we    experienced a significant increase in our consumer automotive    financing penetration levels during this period. GM has provided    financial assistance and incentives to its franchised dealers    through guarantees, agreements to repurchase inventory, equity    investments and subsidies that assist dealers in making interest    payments to financing sources. These financial assistance and    incentive programs are provided at the option of GM, and they    may be terminated in whole or in part at any time. While the    financial assistance and incentives do not relieve the dealers    from their obligations to us or their other financing sources,    if GM were to reduce or terminate any of their financial    assistance and incentive programs, the timing and amount of    payments from GM franchised dealers to us may be adversely    affected. We have    substantial credit exposure to General Motors    Corporation.     We have entered into various operating and financing    arrangements with GM. As a result of these arrangements, we have    substantial credit exposure to GM. However, as part of the Sale    Transactions, this credit exposure has been reduced due to the    termination of various inter-company credit facilities. In    addition, certain unsecured exposure to GM entities in the    U.S. has been contractually capped at $1.5 billion    (actual exposure of $749 million at December 31, 2006).5    Table of Contents GMAC    LLC  Form 10-K     As a marketing incentive GM may sponsor residual support    programs as a way to lower customers monthly payments.    Under residual support programs the contractual residual value    is adjusted above GMACs standard residual rates. At lease    origination, GM pays us the present value of the estimated    amount of residual support it expects to owe at lease    termination. When the lease terminates, GM makes a    true-up payment to us if its estimated residual    support payment was too low, and it still owes us money.    Similarly, we make a true-up payment to GM if    GMs estimated residual payment was too high, and it    overpaid GMAC. Additionally, under what we refer to as lease    pull ahead programs, customers are encouraged to terminate    leases early in conjunction with the acquisition of a new GM    vehicle. As part of these programs, we waive the customers    remaining payment obligation under the current lease, and under    most programs, GM compensates us for the foregone revenue from    the waived payments. Since these programs generally accelerate    our remarketing of the vehicle, the    re-sale    proceeds are typically higher than otherwise would have been    realized had the vehicle been remarketed at lease contract    maturity. The reimbursement from GM for the foregone payments    is, therefore, reduced by the amount of this benefit. GM makes    estimated payments to us at the end of each month in which    customers have pulled their leases ahead. As with residual    support payments, these estimates are trued up once    all the vehicles that could have been pulled ahead have    terminated and been remarketed. To the extent that the original    estimates were incorrect, GM or GMAC may be obligated to pay    each other the difference, as appropriate under the lease    pull-ahead programs. GM is also responsible for risk sharing on    returned lease vehicles in the U.S. whose resale proceeds are    below standard residual values (limited to a floor).     Historically GM has made all payments related to such programs    and arrangements on a timely basis. However, if GM is unable to    pay, fails to pay or is delayed in paying these amounts, our    profitability, financial condition and cash flow could be    adversely affected.     On October 8, 2005, Delphi Corporation, GMs largest    supplier, filed a petition for Chapter 11 proceedings under    the United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with the    split-off of Delphi from GM in 1999, GM entered into contracts    with certain unions to provide contingent benefit guarantees for    limited pension and post retirement health care and life    insurance benefits to certain former GM employees who    transferred to Delphi in connection with the split-off. GM is    contractually responsible for such payments to the extent Delphi    fails to pay these benefits at required levels. Furthermore,    there can be no assurance GM will be able to recover the full    amount of any benefit guarantee payments as required by an    indemnification arrangement between GM and Delphi, and any    payment by Delphi may be significantly limited. Also, Delphi has    significant financial obligations to GM. As a result of    Delphis restructuring, Delphis obligation may be    substantially compromised, which could have an adverse impact on    GM. Our earnings may    decrease because of increases or decreases in interest    rates.     Our profitability is directly affected by changes in interest    rates. The following are some of the risks we face relating to    an increase in interest rates:       Rising interest rates will increase our cost of funds.       Rising interest rates may reduce our consumer automotive    financing volume by influencing consumers to pay cash for, as    opposed to financing, vehicle purchases.       Rising interest rates generally reduce our residential mortgage    loan production as borrowers become less likely to refinance and    the costs associated with acquiring a new home becomes more    expensive.       Rising interest rates will generally reduce the value of    mortgage and automotive financing loans and contracts and    retained interests and fixed income securities held in our    investment portfolio.     We are also subject to risks from decreasing interest rates. For    example, a significant decrease in interest rates could increase    the rate at which mortgages are prepaid, which could require us    to write down the value of our retained interests. Moreover, if    prepayments are greater than expected, the cash we receive over    the life of our mortgage loans held for investment and our    retained interests would be reduced.    Higher-than-expected    prepayments could also reduce the value of our mortgage    servicing rights and, to the extent the borrower does not    refinance with us, the size of our servicing portfolio.    Therefore, any such changes in interest rates could harm our    revenues, profitability and financial condition. Our hedging    strategies may not be successful in mitigating our risks    associated with changes in interest rates and could affect our    profitability and financial condition, as could our failure to    comply with hedge accounting principles and    interpretations.     We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate the    interest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of our assets    and liabilities. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions and    projections regarding our assets, liabilities and general market    factors. If these assumptions and projections prove to be    incorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact of    changes in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may    experience volatility in our earnings that could adversely    affect our profitability and financial condition.     In addition, hedge accounting in accordance with SFAS 133    requires the application of significant subjective judgments to    a body of accounting concepts that is complex and for which the    interpretations have continued to evolve within the accounting    profession and amongst the standard-setting bodies. Within this    Form 10-K,    we have restated prior period financial information to eliminate    hedge accounting treatment that had been applied to certain    callable debt hedged with derivatives. As a result of this6    Table of Contents GMAC    LLC  Form 10-K     matter, we have also communicated in this    Form 10-K    that we have a material weakness in internal control over    financial reporting with regard to the documentation and    effectiveness assessment of derivatives used in such callable    debt hedge strategies. As further described in Item 1B on    page 11, we are in receipt of two comments from the    SECs Division of Corporation Finance on our 2005    10-K and    subsequent filings pertaining to specific aspects of our    compliance with SFAS 133. We believe the ultimate    resolution of these comments will not have a material affect on    our consolidated financial statements presented herein. If,    however, upon resolution of these comments the accounting    treatment for these matters is determined to be different, it    could have a significant impact to our financial condition and    results of operations. Our residential    mortgage subsidiarys ability to pay dividends to us is    restricted by contractual arrangements.     On June 24, 2005, we entered into an operating agreement    with GM and ResCap, the holding company for our residential    mortgage business, to create separation between GM and    ourselves, on the one hand, and ResCap, on the other. The    operating agreement restricts ResCaps ability to declare    dividends or prepay subordinated indebtedness to us. As a result    of these arrangements, ResCap has obtained investment grade    credit ratings for its unsecured indebtedness that are separate    from our ratings. This operating agreement was amended on    November 27, 2006, and again on November 30, 2006, in    conjunction with the Sale Transactions. Among other things,    these amendments removed GM as a party to the agreement.     The restrictions contained in the ResCap operating agreement    include the requirements that ResCaps members equity    be at least $6.5 billion for dividends to be paid. If    ResCap is permitted to pay dividends pursuant to the previous    sentence, the cumulative amount of such dividends may not exceed    50% of our cumulative net income (excluding payments for income    taxes from our election for federal income tax purposes to be    treated as a limited liability company), measured from    July 1, 2005, at the time such dividend is paid. These    restrictions will cease to be effective if ResCaps    members equity has been at least $12 billion as of    the end of each of two consecutive fiscal quarters or if we    cease to be the majority owner. In connection with the Sale    Transactions, GM was released as a party to this operating    agreement, but it remains in effect between ResCap and us. At    December 31, 2006, ResCap had consolidated equity of    approximately $7.7 billion. A failure of or    interruption in the communications and information systems on    which we rely to conduct our business could adversely affect our    revenues and profitability.     We rely heavily upon communications and information systems to    conduct our business. Any failure or interruption of our    information systems or the third-party information systems on    which we rely could cause underwriting or other delays and could    result in fewer applications being received, slower processing    of applications and reduced efficiency in servicing. The    occurrence of any of these events could have a material adverse    effect on our business. We use estimates    and assumptions in determining the fair value of certain of our    assets, in determining our allowance for credit losses, in    determining lease residual values and in determining our    reserves for insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses. If    our estimates or assumptions prove to be incorrect, our cash    flow, profitability, financial condition and business prospects    could be materially adversely affected.     We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fair    value of many of our assets, including retained interests and    securitizations of loans and contracts, mortgage servicing    rights and other investments, which do not have an established    market value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimates    and assumptions in determining our allowance for credit losses    on our loan and contract portfolios, in determining the residual    values of leased vehicles and in determining our reserves for    insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses. It is difficult    to determine the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, and    our actual experience may differ materially from these estimates    and assumptions. As an example, the continued decline of the    domestic housing market, especially with regard to the nonprime    sector, has resulted in increases of the allowance for loan    losses at ResCap for 2006. A material difference between our    estimates and assumptions and our actual experience may    adversely affect our cash flow, profitability, financial    condition and business prospects. Our business    outside the United States exposes us to additional risks that    may cause our revenues and profitability to decline.     We conduct a significant portion of our business outside the    United States. We intend to continue to pursue growth    opportunities for our businesses outside the United States,    which could expose us to greater risks. The risks associated    with our operations outside the United States include:       multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to    change;       differing local product preferences and product requirements;       fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest    rates;       difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign    operations;       differing labor regulations;       consequences from changes in tax laws; and       political and economic instability, natural calamities, war and    terrorism.     The effects of these risks may, individually or in the    aggregate, adversely affect our revenues and profitability.7    Table of Contents GMAC    LLC  Form 10-K Our business    could be adversely affected by changes in currency exchange    rates.     We are exposed to risks related to the effects of changes in    foreign currency exchange rates. Changes in currency exchange    rates can have a significant impact on our earnings from    international operations. While we carefully watch and attempt    to manage our exposure to fluctuation in currency exchange    rates, these types of changes can have material adverse effects    on our business and results of operations and financial    condition. We are exposed to    credit risk which could affect our profitability and financial    condition.     We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in payment    or performance by customers for our contracts and loans, as well    as contracts and loans that are securitized and in which we    retain a residual interest. For example, the continued decline    in the domestic housing market has resulted in an increase in    delinquency rates related to mortgage loans that ResCap either    holds or retains an interest in. There can be no assurances that    our monitoring of our credit risk as it impacts the value of    these assets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through our    risk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies and loss    mitigation strategies are or will be sufficient to prevent an    adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. As    part of the underwriting process, we rely heavily upon    information supplied by third parties. If any of this    information is intentionally or negligently misrepresented and    the misrepresentation is not detected prior to completing the    transaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction may    be increased. Recent    developments in the residential mortgage market, especially in    the nonprime sector, may adversely affect our revenues,    profitability and financial condition     Recently, the residential mortgage market in the United States,    and especially the nonprime sector, has experienced a variety of    difficulties and changed economic conditions that adversely    affected our earnings and financial condition in the fourth    quarter of 2006. Delinquencies and losses with respect to    ResCaps nonprime mortgage loans increased significantly    and may continue to increase. Housing prices in many states have    also declined or stopped appreciating, after extended periods of    significant appreciation. In addition, the liquidity provided to    the nonprime sector has recently been significantly reduced,    which will likely cause ResCaps nonprime mortgage    production to decline. These trends have resulted in significant    writedowns to ResCaps mortgage loans held for sale    portfolio and additions to allowance for loan losses for its    mortgage loans held for investment and warehouse lending    receivables portfolios. The lack of liquidity may also have the    effect of reducing the margin available to ResCap in its sales    and securitizations of nonprime mortgage loans.     Another factor that may result in higher delinquency rates on    mortgage loans is the scheduled increase in monthly payments on    adjustable rate mortgage loans. This increase in borrowers    monthly payments, together with any increase in prevailing    market interest rates, may result in significantly increased    monthly payments for borrowers with adjustable rate mortgage    loans. Borrowers seeking to avoid these increased monthly    payments by refinancing their mortgage loans may no longer be    able to fund available replacement loans at comparably low    interest rates. A decline in housing prices may also leave    borrowers with insufficient equity in their homes to permit them    to refinance their loans or sell their homes. In addition, these    mortgage loans may have prepayment premiums that inhibit    refinancing.     Certain government regulators have observed these issues    involving nonprime mortgages and have indicated an intention to    review the mortgage loan programs. To the extent that regulators    restrict the volume, terms and/or type of nonprime mortgage    loan, the liquidity of our nonprime mortgage loan production and    our profitability from nonprime mortgage loans could be    negatively impacted. Such activity could also negatively impact    our Warehouse Lending volumes and profitability.     The events surrounding the nonprime segment have forced certain    originators to exit the market. Such activities may limit the    volume of nonprime mortgage loans available for us to acquire    and/or our Warehouse Lending volumes, which could negatively    impact our profitability.     These events, alone or in combination, may contribute to higher    delinquency rates, reduce origination volumes or reduce    Warehouse Lending volumes at ResCap. These events could    adversely affect our revenues, profitability and financial    condition. General business    and economic conditions of the industries and geographic areas    in which we operate affect our revenues, profitability and    financial condition.     Our revenues, profitability and financial condition are    sensitive to general business and economic conditions in the    United States and in the markets in which we operate outside the    United States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting in    increased unemployment rates, increased consumer and commercial    bankruptcy filings or other factors that negatively impact    household incomes could decrease demand for our financing and    mortgage products and increase delinquency and loss. In    addition, because our credit exposures are generally    collateralized, the severity of losses is particularly sensitive    to a decline in used vehicle and residential home prices.     Some further examples of these risks include the following:       A significant and sustained increase in gasoline prices could    decrease new and used vehicle purchases, thereby reducing the    demand for automotive retail financing and automotive wholesale    financing.       A general decline in residential home prices in the United    States could negatively affect the value of our mortgage loans    held for investment and our retained interests in securitized    mortgage loans. Such a decrease could also restrict our ability    to originate, sell or securitize mortgage loans and impact the    repayment of advances under our warehouse loans.8    Table of Contents GMAC    LLC  Form 10-K       An increase in automotive labor rates or parts prices could    negatively affect the value of our automotive extended service    contracts. Our profitability    and financial condition may be materially adversely affected by    decreases in the residual value of off-lease vehicles.     Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to an    automotive lease contract is a critical element used to    determine the amount of the lease payments under the contract at    the time the customer enters into it. As a result, to the extent    the actual residual value of the vehicle, as reflected in the    sales proceeds received upon remarketing, is less than the    expected residual value for the vehicle at lease inception, we    incur a loss on the lease transaction. General economic    conditions, the supply of off-lease vehicles and new vehicle    market prices heavily influence used vehicle prices and thus the    actual residual value of off-lease vehicles. GMs brand    image, consumer preference for GM products and GMs    marketing programs that influence the new and used vehicle    market for GM vehicles also influence lease residual values. In    addition, our ability to efficiently process and effectively    market off-lease vehicles impacts the disposal costs and    proceeds realized from the vehicle sales. While GM provides    support for lease residual values including through residual    support programs, this support by GM does not in all cases    entitle us to full reimbursement for the difference between the    remarketing sales proceeds for off-lease vehicles and the    residual value specified in the lease contract. Differences    between the actual residual values realized on leased vehicles    and our expectations of such values at contract inception could    have a negative impact on our profitability and financial    condition. Fluctuations in    valuation of investment securities or significant fluctuations    in investment market prices could negatively affect    revenues.     Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation.    Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an    investment may significantly differ from the reported market    value that could negatively affect our revenues. Fluctuation in    the market price of a security may result from perceived changes    in the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, the    relative price of alternative investments, national and    international events and general market conditions. Changes in    existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgage programs, or    disruptions in the secondary markets in the United States or in    other countries in which our mortgage subsidiaries operate,    could adversely affect the profitability and financial condition    of our mortgage business.     The ability of ResCap to generate revenue through mortgage loan    sales to institutional investors in the United States depends to    a significant degree on programs administered by    government-sponsored enterprises such as Fannie Mae, Freddie    Mac, Ginnie Mae and others that facilitate the issuance of    mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market. These    government-sponsored enterprises play a powerful role in the    residential mortgage industry and our mortgage subsidiaries have    significant business relationships with them. Proposals are    being considered in Congress and by various regulatory    authorities that would affect the manner in which these    government-sponsored enterprises conduct their business,    including proposals to establish a new independent agency to    regulate the government-sponsored enterprises, to require them    to register their stock with the SEC, to reduce or limit certain    business benefits they receive from the U.S. government and    to limit the size of the mortgage loan portfolios they may hold.    Any discontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the    operation of these government-sponsored enterprises could    adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Also, any    significant adverse change in the level of activity in the    secondary market, including declines in the institutional    investors desire to invest in our mortgage products, could    adversely affect our business. We may be    required to repurchase contracts and provide indemnification if    we breach representations and warranties from our securitization    and whole loan transactions, which could harm our profitability    and financial condition.     When we sell retail contracts or leases through whole loan sales    or securitize retail contracts, leases or wholesale loans to    dealers, we are required to make customary representations and    warranties about the contracts, leases or loans to the purchaser    or securitization trust. Our whole loan sale agreements    generally require us to repurchase retail contracts or provide    indemnification if we breach a representation or warranty given    to the purchaser. Likewise, we are required to repurchase retail    contracts, leases or loans and may be required to provide    indemnification if we breach a representation or warranty in    connection with our securitizations.     Similarly, sales by our mortgage subsidiaries of mortgage loans    through whole loan sales or securitizations require us to make    customary representations and warranties about the mortgage    loans to the purchaser or securitization trust. Our whole loan    sale agreements generally require us to repurchase or substitute    loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the    purchaser. In addition, our mortgage subsidiaries may be    required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower    fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly    after its origination. Likewise, we are required to repurchase    or substitute mortgage loans if we breach a representation or    warranty in connection with our securitizations. The remedies    available to a purchaser of mortgage loans may be broader than    those available to our mortgage subsidiaries against the    original seller of the mortgage loan. If a mortgage loan    purchaser enforces its remedies against our mortgage    subsidiaries, we may not be able to enforce the remedies we have    against the seller of the loan or the borrower.9    Table of Contents GMAC    LLC  Form 10-K Significant    indemnification payments or contract, lease or loan repurchase    activity of retail contracts or leases or mortgage loans could    harm our profitability and financial condition.     We and our mortgage subsidiaries have repurchase obligations in    our respective capacities as servicers in securitizations and    whole loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation,    warranty or servicing covenant with respect to an automotive    receivable or mortgage loan, then the servicer may be required    by the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from the    purchaser. If the frequency at which repurchases of assets    occurs increases substantially from its present rate, the result    could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition,    liquidity and results of operations or those of our mortgage    subsidiaries. A loss of    contractual servicing rights could have a material adverse    effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of    operations.     We are the servicer for all of the receivables we have    originated and transferred to other parties in securitizations    and whole loan sales of automotive receivables. Our mortgage    subsidiaries service the mortgage loans we have securitized, and    we service the majority of the mortgage loans we have sold in    whole loan sales. In each case, we are paid a fee for our    services, which fees in the aggregate constitute a substantial    revenue stream for us. In each case, we are subject to the risk    of termination under the circumstances specified in the    applicable servicing provisions.     In most securitizations and whole loan sales, the owner of the    receivables or mortgage loans will be entitled to declare a    servicer default and terminate the servicer upon the occurrence    of specified events. These events typically include a bankruptcy    of the servicer, a material failure by the servicer to perform    its obligations, and a failure by the servicer to turn over    funds on the required basis. The termination of these servicing    rights, were it to occur, could have a material adverse effect    on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations    and those of our mortgage subsidiaries. For the year ended    December 31, 2006, our consolidated mortgage servicing fee    income was approximately $1.6 billion. The regulatory    environment in which we operate could have a material adverse    effect on our business and earnings.     Our domestic operations may be subject to various laws and    judicial and administrative decisions imposing various    requirements and restrictions relating to supervision and    regulation by state and federal authorities. Such regulation and    supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of our    customers, not for the benefit of investors in our securities,    and could limit our discretion in operating our business.    Noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulations could    result in the suspension or revocation of any license or    registration at issue, as well as the imposition of civil fines    and criminal penalties. In addition, changes in the accounting    rules or their interpretation could have an adverse effect on    our business and earnings.     Our operations are also heavily regulated in many jurisdictions    outside the United States. For example, certain of our foreign    subsidiaries operate either as a bank or a regulated finance    company, and our insurance operations are subject to various    requirements in the foreign markets in which we operate. The    varying requirements of these jurisdictions may be inconsistent    with U.S. rules and may materially adversely affect our    business or limit necessary regulatory approvals, or if    approvals are obtained, we may not be able to continue to comply    with the terms of the approvals or applicable regulations. In    addition, in many countries the regulations applicable to the    financial services industry are uncertain and evolving, and it    may be difficult for us to determine the exact regulatory    requirements.     Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatory    requirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a material    adverse effect on our operations in that market with regard to    the affected product and on our reputation generally. No    assurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations will    not be amended or construed differently, that new laws and    regulations will not be adopted or that we will not be    prohibited by local laws from raising interest rates above    certain desired levels, any of which could materially adversely    affect our business, financial condition or results of    operations. The worldwide    financial services industry is highly competitive. If we are    unable to compete successfully or if there is increased    competition in the automotive financing, mortgage    and/or    insurance markets or generally in the markets for    securitizations or asset sales, our margins could be materially    adversely affected.     The markets for automotive and mortgage financing, insurance and    reinsurance are highly competitive. The market for automotive    financing has grown more competitive as more consumers are    financing their vehicle purchases, primarily in North America    and Europe. Our mortgage business faces significant competition    from commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage companies    and other financial institutions. Our insurance business faces    significant competition from insurance carriers, reinsurers,    third-party administrators, brokers and other insurance-related    companies. Many of our competitors have substantial positions    nationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of our    competitors have lower cost structures, lower cost of capital    and are less reliant on securitization and sale activities. We    face significant competition in various areas, including product    offerings, rates, pricing and fees, and customer service. If we    are unable to compete effectively in the markets in which we    operate, our profitability and financial condition could be    negatively affected.     The markets for asset and mortgage securitizations and whole    loan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originators    could increase the amount of their issuances and sales. In    addition, lenders and other investors within those markets often    establish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers,    originators and asset classes, or they may require higher    returns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increased    issuance by other participants in the market, or decisions by    investors to limit their credit exposure to  or to    require10    Table of Contents GMAC    LLC  Form 10-K     a higher yield for  us or to automotive or mortgage    securitizations or whole loans, could negatively affect our    ability and that of our subsidiaries to price our    securitizations and whole loan sales at attractive rates. The    result would be lower proceeds from these activities and lower    profits for our subsidiaries and us. "

Because of the following factors, as well as other factorsaffecting our operating results and financial condition, pastfinancial performance should not be considered to be a reliableindicator of future performance, and investors should not usehistorical trends to anticipate results or trends in futureperiods.Risks Related to Our BusinessWe have recently experienced a series of credit ratingactions, resulting in the downgrade of our credit ratings tohistorically low levels. Any further reduction of our creditratings or failure to restore our credit ratings to1Table of ContentsContentsGeneral Motors Acceptance Corporationhigher levels could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.Substantially all of our unsecured debt has been rated by fournationally recognized statistical rating organizations. Concernsover the competitive and financial strength of our parentcompany, General Motors, including whether it will experience alabor interruption and how it will fund its health careliabilities, have resulted in us experiencing a series of creditrating actions on our unsecured debt concurrent with a series ofcredit actions that downgraded the credit rating on GMsdebt, which commenced late in 2001. As a result, our unsecuredborrowing spreads have widened significantly over the pastseveral years, substantially reducing our access to theunsecured debt markets and impacting our overall cost ofborrowing.On May 5, 2005, Standard & Poorsdowngraded our senior debt to non-investment grade (to BB, fromBBB-) while also downgrading our commercial paper rating toB-1, fromA-3. OnMay 24, 2005, Fitch downgraded our senior debt tonon-investment grade (to BB+, from BBB-) while also downgradingour commercial paper rating to B, from F3. Subsequently, onSeptember 26, 2005, Fitch downgraded our seniorunsecured debt rating to BB from BB+ and affirmed our commercialpaper B rating. While maintaining an investment grade on oursenior debt on August 2, 2005, DBRS downgraded ourlong-term debt to BBB (low) from BBB and our short-termrating was downgraded toR-2 (low) fromR-2 (middle). OnAugust 24, 2005, Moodys downgraded our seniordebt ratings to non-investment grade (to Ba1 from Baa2), whilereducing our short term ratings to Not-Prime fromPrime-2. OnOctober 3, 2005, Standard & Poorsplaced our ratings on CreditWatch with negative implications.Subsequently, on October 10, 2005, Standard &Poors affirmed the CreditWatch for our ratings but changedthe implications from negative to developing, which means thatour ratings could be raised or lowered. Standard &Poors affirmed this status on October 17, 2005.On October 10, 2005, Moodys placed our seniorunsecured ratings under review for a possible downgrade. OnOctober 17, 2005, Moodys changed our reviewstatus to direction uncertain for our senior unsecured ratingsand under review for a possible upgrade for our short-termrating. On January 26, 2006, Moodys confirmed ourrating. On March 16, 2006, Moodys placed our seniorunsecured ratings under review for a possible downgradefollowing GMs announcement that it would delay filing itsannual report onForm 10-K with theSEC. On October 11, 2005, DBRS placed our ratingsunder review with developing implications and onDecember 16, 2005, DBRS affirmed this status. OnOctober 17, 2005, Fitch placed our ratings on RatingWatch Evolving.Further downgrades of our credit ratings would increaseborrowing costs and further constrain our access to unsecureddebt markets, including capital markets for retail debt, and, asa result, would negatively affect our business. In addition,further downgrades of our credit ratings could increase thepossibility of additional terms and conditions being added toany new or replacement financing arrangements as well as impactelements of certain existing secured borrowing arrangements.Our business requires substantial capital, and if we areunable to maintain adequate financing sources, our profitabilityand financial condition will suffer and jeopardize our abilityto continue operations.Our liquidity and ongoing profitability are in large partdependent upon our timely access to capital and the costsassociated with raising funds in different segments of thecapital markets. Our primary sources of financing include publicand private securitizations and whole loan sales. To a lesserextent, we also use institutional unsecured term debt,commercial paper and retail debt offerings. Reliance on any onesource can change going forward.We depend and will continue to depend on our ability to accessdiversified funding alternatives to meet future cash flowrequirements and to continue to fund our operations. Negativecredit events specific to us or our parent, General Motors, orother events affecting the overall debt markets have adverselyimpacted our funding sources, and continued or additionalnegative events could further adversely impact our fundingsources, especially over the long term. As an example, aninsolvency event for our parent would curtail our ability toutilize certain of our automotive wholesale loan securitizationstructures as a source of funding in the future. If we areunable to maintain adequate financing or if other sources ofcapital are not available, we could be forced to suspend,curtail or reduce certain aspects of our operations, which couldharm our revenues, profitability, financial condition andbusiness prospects.Furthermore, we utilize asset and mortgage securitizations andsales as a critical component of our diversified fundingstrategy. Several factors could affect our ability to completesecuritizations and sales, including conditions in thesecurities markets generally, conditions in the asset-backed ormortgage-backed securities markets, the credit quality andperformance of our contracts and loans, our ability to serviceour contracts and loans and a decline in the ratings given tosecurities previously issued in our securitizations. Any ofthese factors could negatively affect the pricing of oursecuritizations and sales, resulting in lower proceeds fromthese activities.Our indebtedness and other obligations are significant andcould materially adversely affect our business.We have a significant amount of indebtedness. As ofDecember 31, 2005, we had $254.4 billion in principalamount of indebtedness outstanding. Interest and discountexpense on our indebtedness constitute approximately 61% of ourtotal revenues. In addition, under the terms of our currentindebtedness, we have the ability to create additional unsecuredindebtedness. If our debt payments increase, whether due to theincreased cost of existing indebtedness or the incurrence ofadditional indebtedness, we may2Table of ContentsContentsGeneral Motors Acceptance Corporationbe required to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flowfrom operations to the payment of principal of, and interest on,our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available forother purposes. Our indebtedness also could limit our ability towithstand competitive pressures and reduce our flexibility inresponding to changing business and economic conditions.The profitability and financial condition of our operationsare dependent upon the operations of our parent, GeneralMotors.A significant portion of our customers are customers of GM,GM dealers and GM related employees. As a result,various aspects of GMs business, including changes in theproduction or sales of GM vehicles, the quality or resalevalue of GM vehicles, the use of GM marketingincentives and other factors impacting GM or its employees couldsignificantly affect our profitability and financial condition.We provide vehicle financing through purchases of retailautomotive and lease contracts with retail customers ofprimarily General Motors dealers. We also finance the purchaseof new and used vehicles by GM dealers through wholesalefinancing, extend other financing to GM dealers, providefleet financing for GM dealers to buy vehicles that theyrent or lease to others, provide wholesale vehicle inventoryinsurance to GM dealers, provide automotive extendedservice contracts through GM dealers and offer otherservices to GM dealers. In 2005, our share ofGM retail sales and sales to dealers were 36% and 82%,respectively, in markets where GM operates. As a result,General Motors level of automobile production and salesdirectly impacts our financing and leasing volume, the premiumrevenue for wholesale vehicle inventory insurance, the volume ofautomotive extended service contracts and also directly impactsthe profitability and financial condition of the GM dealersto whom we provide wholesale financing, term loans and fleetfinancing. In addition, the quality of GM vehicles affectsour obligations under automotive extended service contractsrelating to such vehicles. Further, the resale value of GeneralMotors vehicles, which may be impacted by various factorsrelating to GMs business such as brand image or the numberof new GM vehicles produced, affects the remarketing proceeds wereceive upon the sale of repossessed vehicles and off-leasevehicles at lease termination.General Motors utilizes various rate, residual value and otherfinancing incentives from time to time. The nature, timing andextent of GMs use of incentives has a significant impacton our consumer automotive financing volume and our share ofGMs retail sales, which we refer to as our penetrationlevel. For example, GMs introduction of an employeediscount marketing program in June 2005 had the impact ofreducing our consumer automotive financing penetration levelsduring its existence. Although GM has benefited from an increasein sales, our consumer automotive financing penetration levelshave decreased as such programs do not provide consumers withadditional incentives to finance with us. In addition, inlimited circumstances, General Motors has provided financialassistance and incentives to its franchised dealers throughguarantees, agreements to repurchase inventory, equityinvestments and subsidies that assist dealers in making interestpayments to financing sources. These financial assistance andincentive programs are provided at the option of General Motorsand they may be terminated in whole or in part at any time.While the financial assistance and incentives do not relieve thedealers from their obligations to us or their other financingsources, if General Motors were to reduce or terminate any oftheir financial assistance and incentive programs, the timingand amount of payments from GM franchised dealers to us may beadversely affected.Through our relationship with General Motors, we are able tomarket our residential mortgage and insurance products directlyto GMs current employees and retirees and their families,as well as to GM dealers and suppliers and their families.This group comprised 4.4% and 5.6% of our residential mortgageoriginations at December 31, 2005 and in 2004,respectively. Also, this group comprised 25% of the personalautomobile insurance policyholders in our insurance operationsduring the same periods. Any factors affecting GMsbusiness that result in a reduction in the number of currentGM employees, GM dealers or GM suppliers wouldaffect our residential mortgage and insurance marketingopportunities and could reduce the volume of our mortgageoriginations and personal automobile insurance policies written.We have substantial credit exposure to General Motors.As a wholly owned subsidiary of General Motors, we have enteredinto various operating and financing arrangements with GM. As aresult of these arrangements we have substantial credit exposureto GM. This exposure relates to various financing arrangements(including revolving lines of credit, term loans and leasearrangements on real property; refer to Note 19 to ourConsolidated Financial Statements) where we provide funding toGM. As a marketing incentive GM may sponsor residual supportprograms as a way to lower customers monthly payments.Under residual support programs the contractual residual valueis adjusted above GMACs standard residual rates. To theextent that remarketing sales proceeds are less than thecontractual residual value we have credit exposure to GM as theywould be obligated to pay us under the residual supportprograms. Based on the December 31, 2005 outstanding U.S.operating lease portfolio, the amount that we would expect to bepaid by GM under these lease residual support programs would be$2.5 billion. These projections would be paid over theremaining life of the lease portfolio (on average approximately2 years) and are based on the expected remarketingperformance of the vehicles. The maximum amount that could bepaid under the residual support programs is approximately$4.4 billion and would only be paid in the unlikely eventthat the proceeds from all outstanding lease vehicles would belower than both the contractual residual value and GMACsstandard residual rates. Additionally, under certain pull aheadprograms sponsored by GM, in which consumers are encouraged3Table of ContentsContentsGeneral Motors Acceptance Corporationto terminate leases early in conjunction with the purchase orlease of a new GM vehicle, GM compensates us for theforegone revenue from any lease payment obligations waived inconnection with the program.Historically GM has made all payments related to such programsand arrangements on a timely basis. However, if GM is unable topay, fails to pay or is delayed in paying these amounts, ourprofitability, financial condition and cash flow could beadversely affected.On October 8, 2005, Delphi, GMs largestsupplier, filed a petition for Chapter 11 proceedings underthe United States Bankruptcy Code. In connection with thesplit-off of Delphi from GM in 1999, GM entered into contractswith certain unions to provide contingent benefit guarantees forlimited pension and post retirement health care and lifeinsurance benefits to certain former GM employees whotransferred to Delphi in connection with the split-off. GM iscontractually responsible for such payments to the extent Delphifails to pay these benefits at required levels. Furthermore,there can be no assurance that GM will be able to recover thefull amount of any benefit guarantee payments as required by anindemnification arrangement between GM and Delphi, and anypayment by Delphi may be significantly limited. Also, Delphi hassignificant financial obligations to GM. As a result ofDelphis restructuring, Delphis obligation may besubstantially compromised, which could have an adverse impact onGM.The challenges faced by Delphi during its restructuring processcould create operating and financial risks for GM. GM might beadversely affected by any disruption in the supply of automotivesystems, components and parts which could potentially force thesuspension of production at GM assembly facilities.Additionally, as a result of Delphis pursuit of arestructuring plan, there is the risk that negotiations couldresult in labor disruptions at Delphi. A material financialimpact on GM resulting from obligations under the contingentbenefit guarantees or because of labor disruptions at Delphicould adversely affect GMs ability to pay amounts owed tous.As a wholly owned subsidiary of GM, we are jointly andseverally responsible with GM and its other subsidiaries forfunding obligations under GMs and its subsidiariesqualified U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Our financialcondition and our ability to repay unsecured debt could beimpaired if we were required to pay significant fundingobligations for the GM plans.Pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,or ERISA, members of the GM control group  of whichwe are a member  are jointly and severally liable tothe Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) for certain GMIRS-qualified U.S. defined benefit pension plan liabilitiesand to any trustee appointed if one or more of these pensionplans were to be terminated by PBGC in a distress termination.The liabilities with respect to a terminated plan would belimited to the liabilities of the plan on a termination date, ifand to the extent that any liabilities of the terminated planwould be (i) the liability for certain contributions ifmissed and (ii) the liabilities of the plan on atermination date, if and to the extent not covered by the assetsof the plan.In 2003 and 2004, GM and its subsidiaries contributed a total of$18.7 billion to their IRS-qualified defined benefitpension plans in part to fund certain subsidiary ERISA minimumcontribution requirements. In 2005, GM contributed$0.1 billion to its IRS-qualified U.S. defined benefitplans and is not expected to be required to make a materialcontribution to those plans in 2006.GMs future funding obligations for its IRS-qualifiedU.S. defined benefit pension plans depend upon, among otherthings, changes in the level of benefits provided for by theplans, the future performance of assets set aside in trusts forthese plans, the level of interest rates used to determineminimum ERISA funding levels, actuarial assumptions andexperience, and any changes in government laws and regulations.If GM is legally required to make minimum contributions to thoseplans in the future, those contributions could be significant.In addition, if GM or PBGC were to terminate any of the plansthere would likely be considerable excess liabilities notcovered by the assets of the plans. As a member of the GMcontrolled group, GMAC is jointly and severally liable to payany plan deficiencies and could have a lien placed on its assetsby the PBGC to collateralize this liability, not exceeding 30%of the collective net worth of the GM controlled group. Ourfinancial condition and ability to repay unsecured debt could bematerially adversely affected to the extent we are required topay some or all of these obligations.We are exposed to credit risk which could affect ourprofitability and financial condition.We are subject to credit risk resulting from defaults in paymentor performance by customers for our contracts and loans as wellas contracts and loans that are securitized and in which weretain a residual interest. There can be no assurances that ourmonitoring of our credit risk as it impacts the value of theseassets and our efforts to mitigate credit risk through ourrisk-based pricing, appropriate underwriting policies and lossmitigation strategies are or will be sufficient to prevent anadverse effect on our profitability and financial condition. Aspart of the underwriting process, we rely heavily uponinformation supplied by third parties. If any of thisinformation is intentionally or negligently misrepresented andthe misrepresentation is not detected prior to completing thetransaction, the credit risk associated with the transaction maybe increased.4Table of ContentsContentsGeneral Motors Acceptance CorporationOur earnings may decrease because of increases or decreasesin interest rates.Our profitability is directly affected by changes in interestrates. The following are some of the risks we face relating toan increase in interest rates:     Rising interest rates will increase our cost of funds.      Rising interest rates may reduce our consumer automotive    financing volume by influencing consumers to pay cash for, as    opposed to financing, vehicle purchases.      Rising interest rates generally reduce our residential mortgage    loan production as borrowers become less likely to refinance and    the costs associated with acquiring a new home becomes more    expensive.      Rising interest rates will generally reduce the value of    mortgage and automotive financing loans and contracts and    retained interests and fixed income securities held in our    investment portfolio.We are also subject to risks from decreasing interest rates. Forexample, a significant decrease in interest rates could increasethe rate at which mortgages are prepaid, which could require usto write down the value of our retained interests. Moreover, ifprepayments are greater than expected, the cash we receive overthe life of our mortgage loans held for investment and ourretained interests would be reduced. Higher-than-expectedprepayments could also reduce the value of our mortgageservicing rights and, to the extent the borrower does notrefinance with us, the size of our servicing portfolio.Therefore, any such changes in interest rates could harm ourrevenues, profitability, and financial condition.Our hedging strategies may not be successful in mitigatingour risks associated with changes in interest rates and couldaffect our profitability and financial condition.We employ various economic hedging strategies to mitigate theinterest rate and prepayment risk inherent in many of ourassets. Our hedging strategies rely on assumptions andprojections regarding our assets, liabilities and general marketfactors. If these assumptions and projections prove to beincorrect or our hedges do not adequately mitigate the impact ofchanges in interest rates or prepayment speeds, we may incurlosses that could adversely affect our profitability andfinancial condition.Our residential mortgage subsidiarys ability to paydividends and to prepay subordinated debt obligations to us isrestricted by contractual arrangements.On June 24, 2005, we entered into an operatingagreement with GM and Residential Capital Corporation (ResCap),the holding company for our residential mortgage business, tocreate separation between GM and ourselves, on the one hand, andResCap, on the other. The operating agreement restrictsResCaps ability to declare dividends or prepaysubordinated indebtedness to us. As a result of thesearrangements, ResCap has obtained investment grade creditratings for its unsecured indebtedness that are separate fromour ratings and the ratings of GM.The restrictions contained in the ResCap operating agreementinclude the requirements that ResCaps stockholdersequity be at least $6.5 billion in order for dividends tobe paid to us or our other affiliates, and that the cumulativeamount of any such dividends may not exceed 50% of ResCapscumulative consolidated net income, measured fromJuly 1, 2005, through the time such dividend is paid,minus the cumulative amount of certain prepayments of oursubordinated debt by ResCap if such prepayments exceed 50% ofResCaps cumulative consolidated net income at the time adividend is paid. At December 31, 2005, ResCap hadconsolidated stockholders equity of approximately$7.5 billion.The ResCap operating agreement further restricts ResCapsability to prepay subordinated debt owed to us or any of ourother affiliates. As of December 31, 2005, ResCap owedus $4.1 billion pursuant to a SubordinatedNote Agreement, under which interest is payable quarterlyand all outstanding principal is due at maturity onSeptember 30, 2015.A failure of or interruption in the communications andinformation systems on which we rely to conduct our businesscould adversely affect our revenues and profitability.We rely heavily upon communications and information systems toconduct our business in each country and market in which weoperate. Any failure or interruption of our information systemsor the third-party information systems on which we rely couldcause underwriting or other delays and could result in fewerapplications being received, slower processing of applicationsand reduced efficiency in servicing. The occurrence of any ofthese events could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.We use estimates and assumptions in determining the fairvalue of certain of our assets, in determining our allowance forcredit losses, in determining lease residual values and indetermining our reserves for insurance losses and lossadjustment expenses. If our estimates or assumptions prove to beincorrect, our cash flow, profitability, financial condition andbusiness prospects could be materially adversely affected.We use estimates and various assumptions in determining the fairvalue of many of our assets, including retained interests andsecuritizations of loans and contracts, mortgage servicingrights and other investments which do not have an establishedmarket value or are not publicly traded. We also use estimatesand assumptions in determining our allowance for credit losseson our5Table of ContentsContentsGeneral Motors Acceptance Corporationloan and contract portfolios, in determining the residual valuesof leased vehicles and in determining our reserves for insurancelosses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reportedlosses and losses incurred but not reported. It is difficult todetermine the accuracy of our estimates and assumptions, and ouractual experience may differ materially from these estimates andassumptions. A material difference between our estimates andassumptions and our actual experience may adversely affect ourcash flow, profitability, financial condition and businessprospects.Our business outside the United States exposes us toadditional risks that may cause our revenues and profitabilityto decline.We conduct a significant portion of our business outside theUnited States. We intend to continue to pursue growthopportunities for our businesses outside the United States,which could expose us to greater risks. The risks associatedwith our operations outside the United States include:     multiple foreign regulatory requirements that are subject to    change;      differing local product preferences and product requirements;      fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest    rates;      difficulty in establishing, staffing and managing foreign    operations;      differing labor regulations;      consequences from changes in tax laws; and      political and economic instability, natural calamities, war and    terrorism.The effects of these risks may, individually or in theaggregate, adversely affect our revenues and profitability.Our business could be adversely affected by changes incurrency exchange rates.We are exposed to risks related to the effects of changes inforeign currency exchange rates. Changes in currency exchangerates can have a significant impact on our earnings frominternational operations. While we carefully watch and attemptto manage our exposure to fluctuation in currency exchangerates, these types of changes can have material adverse effectson our business and results of operations and financialcondition.General business and economic conditions of the industriesand geographic areas in which we operate affect our revenues,profitability and financial condition.Our revenues, profitability and financial condition aresensitive to general business and economic conditions in theUnited States and in the markets in which we operate outside theUnited States. A downturn in economic conditions resulting inincreased unemployment rates, increased consumer and commercialbankruptcy filings or other factors that negatively impacthousehold incomes could decrease demand for our financing andmortgage products and increase delinquency and loss. Inaddition, because our credit exposures are generallycollateralized, the severity of losses is particularly sensitiveto a decline in used vehicle and residential home prices.Some further examples of these risks include the following:     A significant and sustained increase in gasoline prices could    decrease new and used vehicle purchases, thereby reducing the    demand for automotive retail financing and automotive wholesale    financing.      A general decline in residential home prices in the United    States could negatively affect the value of our mortgage loans    held for investment and our retained interests in securitized    mortgage loans. Such a decrease could also restrict our ability    to originate, sell or securitize mortgage loans and impact the    repayment of advances under our warehouse loans.      An increase in automotive labor rates or parts prices could    negatively affect the value of our automotive extended service    contracts.Our profitability and financial condition may be materiallyadversely affected by decreases in the residual value ofoff-lease vehicles.Our expectation of the residual value of a vehicle subject to anautomotive lease contract is a critical element used todetermine the amount of the lease payments under the contract atthe time that it is entered into by the customer. As a result,to the extent that the actual residual value of the vehicle, asreflected in the sales proceeds received upon remarketing, isless than the expected residual value for the vehicle at leaseinception, we incur a loss on the lease transaction. Generaleconomic conditions, the supply of off-lease vehicles and newvehicle market prices heavily influence used vehicle prices andthus the actual residual value of off-lease vehicles. GMsbrand image, consumer preference for GM products and GMsmarketing programs that influence the new and used vehiclemarket for GM vehicles also influence lease residual values. Inaddition, our ability to efficiently process and effectivelymarket off-lease vehicles impacts the disposal costs andproceeds realized from the vehicle sales. While GM providessupport for lease residual values including through residualsupport programs, this support by GM does not in all casesentitle us to full reimbursement for the difference between theremarketing sales proceeds for off-lease vehicles and theresidual value specified in the lease contract. Differencesbetween the actual residual values realized on leased vehiclesand our expectations of such values at contract inception couldhave a negative impact on our profitability and financialcondition.6Table of ContentsContentsGeneral Motors Acceptance CorporationFluctuations in valuation of investment securities orsignificant fluctuations in investment market prices couldnegatively affect revenues.Investment market prices in general are subject to fluctuation.Consequently, the amount realized in the subsequent sale of aninvestment may significantly differ from the reported marketvalue which could negatively affect our revenues. Fluctuation inthe market price of a security may result from perceived changesin the underlying economic characteristics of the investee, therelative price of alternative investments, national andinternational events and general market conditions.Changes in existing U.S. government-sponsored mortgageprograms, or disruptions in the secondary markets in the UnitedStates or in other countries in which our mortgage subsidiariesoperate, could adversely affect the profitability and financialcondition of our mortgage business.The ability of our mortgage subsidiaries to generate revenuethrough mortgage loan sales to institutional investors in theUnited States depends to a significant degree on programsadministered by government-sponsored enterprises such as FannieMae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae and others that facilitate theissuance of mortgage-backed securities in the secondary market.These government-sponsored enterprises play a powerful role inthe residential mortgage industry and our mortgage subsidiarieshave significant business relationships with them. Proposals arebeing considered in Congress and by various regulatoryauthorities that would affect the manner in which thesegovernment-sponsored enterprises conduct their business,including proposals to establish a new independent agency toregulate the government-sponsored enterprises, to require themto register their stock with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, to reduce or limit certain business benefits thatthey receive from the U.S. government and to limit the sizeof the mortgage loan portfolios that they may hold. Anydiscontinuation of, or significant reduction in, the operationof these government-sponsored enterprises could adversely affectour revenues and profitability. Also, any significant adversechange in the level of activity in the secondary market or theunderwriting criteria of these government-sponsored enterprisescould adversely affect our business.We may be required to repurchase contracts and provideindemnification if we breach representations and warranties fromour securitization and whole loan transactions, which could harmour profitability and financial condition.When we sell retail contracts or leases through whole loan salesor securitize retail contracts, leases or wholesale loans todealers, we are required to make customary representations andwarranties about the contracts, leases or loans to the purchaseror securitization trust. Our whole loan sale agreementsgenerally require us to repurchase retail contracts or provideindemnification if we breach a representation or warranty givento the purchaser. Likewise, we are required to repurchase retailcontracts, leases or loans and may be required to provideindemnification if we breach a representation or warranty inconnection with our securitizations.Similarly, sales by our mortgage subsidiaries of mortgage loansthrough whole loan sales or securitizations require us to makecustomary representations and warranties about the mortgageloans to the purchaser or securitization trust. Our whole loansale agreements generally require us to repurchase or substituteloans if we breach a representation or warranty given to thepurchaser. In addition, our mortgage subsidiaries may berequired to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrowerfraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortlyafter its origination. Likewise, we are required to repurchaseor substitute mortgage loans if we breach a representation orwarranty in connection with our securitizations. The remediesavailable to a purchaser of mortgage loans may be broader thanthose available to our mortgage subsidiaries against theoriginal seller of the mortgage loan. If a mortgage loanpurchaser enforces its remedies against our mortgagesubsidiaries, we may not be able to enforce the remedies we haveagainst the seller of the loan or the borrower.Significant indemnification payments or contract, lease orloan repurchase activity of retail contracts or leases ormortgage loans could harm our profitability and financialcondition.We and our mortgage subsidiaries have repurchase obligations inour respective capacities as servicers in securitizations andwhole loan sales. If a servicer breaches a representation,warranty or servicing covenant with respect to an automotivereceivable or mortgage loan, then the servicer may be requiredby the servicing provisions to repurchase that asset from thepurchaser. If the frequency at which repurchases of assetsoccurs increases substantially from its present rate, the resultcould be a material adverse effect on our financial condition,liquidity and results of operations or those of our mortgagesubsidiaries.A loss of contractual servicing rights could have a materialadverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and resultsof operations.We are the servicer for all of the receivables we haveoriginated and transferred to other parties in securitizationsand whole loan sales of automotive receivables. Our mortgagesubsidiaries service the mortgage loans we have securitized, andwe service the majority of the mortgage loans that we have soldin whole loan sales. In each case, we are paid a fee for ourservices, which fees in the aggregate constitute a substantialrevenue stream for us. In each case, we are subject to the riskof termination under the circumstances specified in theapplicable servicing provisions.7Table of ContentsContentsGeneral Motors Acceptance CorporationIn most securitizations and whole loan sales, the owner of thereceivables or mortgage loans will be entitled to declare aservicer default and terminate the servicer upon the occurrenceof specified events. These events typically include a bankruptcyof the servicer, a material failure by the servicer to performits obligations, and a failure by the servicer to turn overfunds on the required basis. The termination of these servicingrights, were it to occur, could have a material adverse effecton our financial condition, liquidity and results of operationsand those of our mortgage subsidiaries. For the year endedDecember 31, 2005, our consolidated mortgage servicingfee income was $1,608 million.The regulatory environment in which we operate could have amaterial adverse effect on our business and earnings.Our domestic operations may be subject to various laws andjudicial and administrative decisions imposing variousrequirements and restrictions relating to supervision andregulation by state and federal authorities. Such regulation andsupervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of ourcustomers, and not for the benefit of investors in oursecurities, and could limit our discretion in operating ourbusiness. Noncompliance with applicable statutes or regulationscould result in the suspension or revocation of any license orregistration at issue, as well as the imposition of civil finesand criminal penalties. In addition, changes in the accountingrules or their interpretation could have an adverse effect onour business and earnings.Our operations are also heavily regulated in many jurisdictionsoutside the United States. For example, certain of our foreignsubsidiaries operate either as a bank or a regulated financecompany in their local market and our insurance operations aresubject to various requirements in the foreign markets in whichwe operate. The varying requirements of these jurisdictions maybe inconsistent with U.S. rules and may materiallyadversely affect our business or limit necessary regulatoryapprovals, or if approvals are obtained, we may not be able tocontinue to comply with the terms of the approvals or applicableregulations. In addition, in many countries the regulationsapplicable to the financial services industry are uncertain andevolving, and it may be difficult for us to determine the exactregulatory requirements.Our inability to remain in compliance with regulatoryrequirements in a particular jurisdiction could have a materialadverse effect on our operations in that market with regard tothe affected product and on our reputation generally. Noassurance can be given that applicable laws or regulations willnot be amended or construed differently, that new laws andregulations will not be adopted or that we will not beprohibited by local laws from raising interest rates abovecertain desired levels, any of which could materially adverselyaffect our business, financial condition or results ofoperations.The worldwide financial services industry is highlycompetitive. If we are unable to compete successfully or ifthere is increased competition in the automotive financing,mortgage and/or insurance markets or generally in the marketsfor securitizations or asset sales, our margins could bematerially adversely affected.The markets for automotive and mortgage financing, insurance andreinsurance are highly competitive. The market for automotivefinancing has grown more competitive as more consumers arefinancing their vehicle purchases, primarily in North Americaand Europe. Our mortgage business faces significant competitionfrom commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage companiesand other financial institutions. Our insurance business facessignificant competition from insurance carriers, reinsurers,third-party administrators, brokers, and other insurance-relatedcompanies. Many of our competitors have substantial positionsnationally or in the markets in which they operate. Some of ourcompetitors have lower cost structures, lower cost of capitaland are less reliant on securitization and sale activities. Weface significant competition in various areas, including productofferings, rates, pricing and fees and customer service. If weare unable to compete effectively in the markets in which weoperate, our profitability and financial condition could benegatively affected.The markets for asset and mortgage securitizations and wholeloan sales are competitive, and other issuers and originatorscould increase the amount of their issuances and sales. Inaddition, lenders and other investors within those markets oftenestablish limits on their credit exposure to particular issuers,originators and asset classes, or they may require higherreturns to increase the amount of their exposure. Increasedissuance by other participants in the market, or decisions byinvestors to limit their credit exposure to  or torequire a higher yield for  us or to automotive ormortgage securitizations or whole loans, could negatively affectour ability and that of our subsidiaries to price oursecuritizations and whole loan sales at attractive rates. Theresult would be lower proceeds from these activities and lowerprofits for our subsidiaries and us.Risks Related to Our Controlling StockholderGM is considering the sale of a controlling interest in us aswell as exploring strategic and structural alternatives forResCap. There is a risk that these initiatives may not occur, orif they do occur, they may not delink our credit rating fromGMs credit rating or maintain ResCaps investmentgrade ratings.As previously announced, GM is exploring the possible sale of acontrolling interest in us, as well as exploring other strategicand structural alternatives with respect to ResCap. The extentof the effect on GMACs and ResCaps ratings, if any,will depend on the structure and other terms of any potentialtransaction as well as the extent of our ongoing credit exposureto GM. We are uncertain at this time if any transaction withrespect to us or ResCap will occur or, if any transaction wereto occur, on what terms. Furthermore, even if a third partyacquires a controlling interest in us, or if a transaction iscompleted with respect to ResCap, there8Table of ContentsContentsGeneral Motors Acceptance Corporationis the possibility that these initiatives will not restore ourcredit rating or maintain ResCaps credit rating atinvestment grade.Failure to execute a strategic transaction will place furtherpressure on both GMs and our credit profiles, potentiallyresulting in further downgrades with our ratings likelyre-linked to those of GM. Moreover, any reduction in theautomotive finance capacity of GMAC could materially adverselyaffect GMs business, to the extent that third partyfinancing is not available to fund GMs automotive sales.In the absence of a transaction:     Our access to capital may be seriously constrained, as most    unsecured funding sources may decline, including bank funding;      The cost of funds related to borrowings that are secured by    assets (known as secured funding) may increase and    this could lead to a reduction in liquidity for certain asset    classes.      It may be increasingly difficult to securitize assets, resulting    in reduced capacity to support overall automotive originations    as well as reduced advances on future securitizations;      Uncompetitive funding costs may result in a lower return on    capital and significantly lower earnings and dividends; and      We may need to consider divesting of certain businesses in order    to maintain adequate liquidity to fund new originations or    otherwise preserve the value of our business"
