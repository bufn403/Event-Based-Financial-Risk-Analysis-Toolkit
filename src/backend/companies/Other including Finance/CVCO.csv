3,CVCO,CAVCO INDUSTRIES INC,2011-06-03,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSOur business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider thefollowing risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The itemsdescribed below are not the only risks facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown tous or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affectour financial condition or results of operations.We operate in an industry that is currently experiencing a prolonged and significant downturnSince mid-1999, the manufactured housing industry has experienced a prolonged and significantdownturn. This downturn has resulted in part from the fact that, beginning in 1999, consumerlenders in the sector began to tighten underwriting standards and curtail credit availability inresponse to higher than anticipated rates of loan defaults and significant losses upon therepossession and resale of manufactured homes securing defaulted loans. In more recent years, theindustrys downturn was exacerbated by the aggressive financing methods available to customers ofdevelopers and marketers of standard site-built homes which had the effect of diverting potentialmanufactured housing buyers to more expensive site-built homes, the global credit crisis, andgeneral deterioration of economic conditions. These factors have resulted in reduced wholesaleshipments and excess manufacturing and retail locations. 10Table of ContentsAs a result of the foregoing factors, based on industry data as of the end of 2010, the numberof active industry manufacturing facilities has dropped by 149 plants to 131, representing a 53%reduction since the end of 2000.The availability of consumer financing for the purchase of manufactured homes continues to beconstrained, as discussed below. Although it is difficult to predict future industry conditions,the current market environment tends to indicate that a sustained recovery in the manufacturedhousing industry is unlikely to occur in the near term.If current industry conditions continue or get materially worse, we may be required to takesteps in an attempt to mitigate the effect of unfavorable industry conditions, such as the closureof facilities or consolidation of existing operations. These steps could impair our ability toconduct our business in a manner consistent with past practice and could make it more difficult forus to expand our operations if and when industry conditions improve. Furthermore, some of thesesteps could lead to fixed asset, goodwill or other impairment charges.We may not be able to complete the acquisition of Standard Casualty Co. and successfully integrateFleetwood Homes, Palm Harbor, and any future acquisition or attain the anticipated benefits and theacquisition of Fleetwood Homes, Palm Harbor and other future acquisitions may adversely impact theCompanys liquidityOn April 23, 2011, subsequent to our March fiscal year-end, a subsidiary of Fleetwood Homes,Inc., owned 50% by Cavco and 50% by Third Avenue Value Fund, purchased substantially all of theassets and certain liabilities of Palm Harbor Homes, Inc., a Florida corporation. Palm Harbor is amanufacturer and marketer of factory-built housing and a provider of related consumer financing andinsurance products. The aggregate gross purchase price was $83.9 million and is exclusive oftransaction costs, specified liabilities assumed and post-closing adjustments. Of the purchaseprice, approximately $45.3 million was used to retire the debtor-in-possession loan previously madeby Fleetwood Homes to Palm Harbor, and $13.4 million was deposited in escrow pending regulatorysale approval for the stock of Standard Casualty Co., at which time the escrowed funds will bereleased to the Palm Harbor estate. In addition, we purchased all of the outstanding shares ofCountryPlace Acceptance Corp., CountryPlace Mortgage, Ltd. and their wholly-owned financesubsidiaries. We also acquired all of the outstanding shares of Standard Insurance Agency, Inc.and its wholly-owned insurance agency subsidiary, subject, however to a claw-back agreement toreturn those shares to Palm Harbor if regulatory approval of the Standard Casualty Co. transfercannot be obtained, as described above. Further, we assumed certain liabilities of Palm Harbor,including primarily debt facilities of the finance subsidiaries and certain warranty obligations.The purchase price was funded by Fleetwood Homes cash on hand, along with contributions of $36million each from Cavco and Third Avenue (see Notes 10 and 12).We completed the acquisition of certain manufactured housing assets and liabilities ofFleetwood Homes in fiscal year 2010. We may also consider other strategic acquisitions if suchopportunities arise. Any transactions that we consider may involve a number of risks, includingthe diversion of our managements attention from our existing business for those transactions thatwe complete, or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration processand on our liquidity. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate,operate, maintain and manage the newly acquired operations or employees of Fleetwood Homes, PalmHarbor, or potential future acquisitions or complete the acquisition of the stock of StandardCasualty Co. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies,which may lead to operational inefficiencies.Our expansion of retail and manufacturing businesses and entry into new lines of business, namelymanufactured housing consumer finance and insurance, through the Palm Harbor transaction couldexpose the Company to additional risksAs a result of the Palm Harbor acquisition effective April 23, 2011, we have significantlyexpanded our manufactured housing retail and manufacturing businesses and entered into newmanufactured housing consumer finance and property and casualty insurance lines of business. Thesenew businesses may expose the Company to additional risks and uncertainties.As of March 31, 2011, the Company operated ten homebuilding facilities located in theNorthwest, Southwest, South Central, South and Mid-Atlantic regions. With the acquisition of PalmHarbor, we increased our geographic reach by adding five operating factory-built housing productionfacilities in four states, idled factories in nine locations and 49 company-owned retail salescenters and builder locations in nine states. These Palm Harbor locations are in the same regionsas the Companys legacy business, plus Florida. The transaction significantly increased ourpresence in Texas by adding factories in the cities of Ft. Worth and Austin to ourexisting manufacturing facilities in Seguin and Waco. Of Palm Harbors company-owned salescenters, 31 are located in Texas. While Texas has lagged the national recession to a certainextent, a further decline in the economic conditions of Texas could have a material adverse effecton our results of operations as well.CountryPlace offers conforming mortgages to purchasers of factory-built homes sold byCompany-owned retail sales centers and certain independent retail dealers, builders and developers.CountryPlace is an approved seller-servicer with Fannie Mae, is approved by HUD to originateFHA-insured mortgages under its Direct Endorsement program, and is approved to issue Ginnie Maemortgage-backed securities. The loans originated through CountryPlace are sold to investors.CountryPlace also provides various loan origination and servicing functions for non-affiliatedentities under contract. 11Table of ContentsChanges in laws or other events that adversely affect liquidity in the secondary mortgagemarket could hurt our business. The government-sponsored enterprises, principally Fannie Mae,Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac, play a significant role in buying home mortgages and creatinginvestment securities that they either sell to investors or hold in their portfolios. Theseorganizations provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market and have recently experiencedfinancial difficulties. Any new federal laws or regulations that restrict or curtail theiractivities, or any other events or conditions that prevent or restrict these enterprises fromcontinuing their historic businesses, could affect the ability of our customers to obtain themortgage loans or could increase mortgage interest rates, fees, and credit standards, which couldreduce demand for our homes and/or the loans that we originate and adversely affect our results ofoperations.If CountryPlaces customers are unable to repay their loans, CountryPlace may be adverselyaffected. CountryPlace makes loans to borrowers that it believes are creditworthy basedon its credit guidelines. However, the ability of these customers to repay their loans may beaffected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to: national, regional and localeconomic conditions; changes or continued weakness in specific industry segments; natural hazardrisks affecting the region in which the borrower resides; and employment, financial or lifecircumstances.If customers do not repay their loans, CountryPlace may repossess or foreclose in order toliquidate its loan collateral and minimize losses. The homes and land securing the loans aresubject to fluctuating market values, and proceeds realized from liquidating repossessed orforeclosed property are highly susceptible to adverse movements in collateral values. Recent andcontinued trends in general house price depreciation and increasing levels of unemployment mayresult in additional defaults and exacerbate actual loss severities upon collateral liquidationbeyond those normally experienced by CountryPlace.Some of the loans CountryPlace has originated or may originate in the future may not have aliquid market, or the market may contract rapidly in the future and the loans may become illiquid.Although CountryPlace offers loan products and prices its loans at levels that it believes aremarketable at the time of credit application approval, market conditions for mortgage-related loanshave deteriorated rapidly and significantly recently. CountryPlaces ability to respond to changingmarket conditions is bound by credit approval and funding commitments it makes in advance of loancompletion. In this environment, it is difficult to predict the types of loan products andcharacteristics that may be susceptible to future market curtailments and tailor our loan offeringsaccordingly. As a result, no assurances can be given that the market value of our loans will notdecline in the future, or that a market will continue to exist for loan products.Standard Casualty Co. and Standard Insurance Agency specialize in the manufactured housingindustry, primarily serving the Texas, Georgia, Arizona and New Mexico markets. In Texas, thepolicies are written through one affiliated managing general agent, which produces all premiums,except surety, through local agents, most of which are manufactured home dealers. All businessoutside the state of Texas is written on a direct basis through local agents. Property andcasualty insurance companies are subject to certain Risk-Based Capital requirements as specified bythe National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Under those requirements, the amount ofcapital and surplus maintained by a property and casualty insurance company is to be determinedbased on the various risk factors related to it.Tightened credit standards, curtailed lending activity by home-only lenders and increasedgovernment lending regulations have contributed to a constrained consumer financing marketConsumers who buy our manufactured homes have historically secured retail financing fromthird-party lenders. The availability, terms and costs of retail financing depend on the lendingpractices of financial institutions, governmental policies and economic and other conditions, allof which are beyond our control. Legislation, including certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank WallStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act may adversely affect the availability and cost ofmanufactured home loans. A consumer seeking to finance the purchase of a manufactured home withoutland will generally pay a higher interest rate and have a shorter loan maturity than a consumerseeking to finance the purchase of land and the home. In addition, home-only financing is at timesmore difficult to obtain than financing for site-built homes. Since 1999, home-only lenders havetightened the credit underwriting standards and increased interest rates for loans to purchasemanufactured homes, which have reduced lending volumes which has negatively impacted our sales.Most of the national lenders who have historically provided home-only loans have exited this sectorof the industry. Conseco Finance Corp. (Conseco Finance) was historically one of the largestoriginators of home-only loans in themanufactured housing industry. In December 2002, Conseco Inc., the parent company of ConsecoFinance, filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased its lending activities. In May 2004, JPMorganChase Bank N.A., the lender with the largest loan origination volume in the home-only financingmarket at that time, announced it was ceasing its manufactured housing lending activities. InMarch 2008, Origen Financial, Inc. (Origen) announced that it was suspending originations ofmanufactured home loans as a result of unfavorable conditions in the secondary market for itsloans. Another major lender, 21st Mortgage Corporation, citing unreliable andinadequate sources of funding, announced in January 2009 that it was significantly curtailing itsretail lending program. Remaining retail lenders such as Triad Financial Services, Inc. (Triad),U.S. Bank, and CU Factory Built Lending have tightened their loan underwriting standards. If otherlenders do not absorb the volume of loans previously made by these lenders, we could experiencefurther retail and manufacturing sales declines. 12Table of ContentsThe availability of wholesale financing for industry retailers is limited due to a reduced numberof floor plan lenders and reduced lending limitsManufactured housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesalefloor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing issignificantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. During thepast seven years, a substantial number of wholesale lenders have exited the industry or curtailedtheir floor plan operations. Conseco Finance was historically the largest floor plan lender,previously providing about 25% of the industrys wholesale financing. Conseco Finance discontinuedapproving and funding new floor plan loan requests in April 2002 and filed for bankruptcyprotection in December 2002. With Conseco Finances exit, Deutsche Financial Services was thelargest remaining floor plan lender, providing approximately 20% of the industrys wholesalefinancing. Deutsche Financial Services discontinued approving and funding new floor plan loanrequests in November 2002 and proceeded to liquidate its existing floor plan receivables. Inrecent years, the Companys independent retailers have relied primarily on GE CommercialDistribution Finance, Textron Financial Corporation and 21st Mortgage Corporation,national lending institutions that have specialized in providing wholesale floor plan financing tomanufactured housing retailers. As a result of the current credit crisis, in the last half of2008, each of these remaining national floor plan lenders substantially curtailed their lendingactivities, and Textron Financial Corporation announced its exit from the business. We areconcerned that floor plan financing providers could further reduce their levels of floor planlending. Reduced availability of floor plan lending negatively affects the inventory levels of ourindependent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand,and adversely affects the availability of and our access to capital on an ongoing basis.Our operating results could be affected by market forces and declining housing demandAs a participant in the homebuilding industry, we are subject to market forces beyond ourcontrol. These market forces include employment and employment growth, interest rates, consumerconfidence, land availability and development costs, apartment vacancy levels, and the health ofthe general economy. Unfavorable changes in any of the above factors or other issues could have anadverse effect on our sales and earnings.We have incurred net losses in certain prior periods and there can be no assurance that we willgenerate income in the futureSince becoming a stand-alone public company, we have generated net income each complete fiscalyear, except for fiscal year 2010, in which we incurred net losses attributable in substantial partto the downturn affecting the manufactured housing industry, which is discussed in detail above.The likelihood that we will generate net income in the future must be considered in light of thedifficulties facing the manufactured housing industry as a whole, economic conditions, thecompetitive environment in which we operate and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in thisAnnual Report. There can be no assurance that we will generate net income in the future.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and networthAs of March 31, 2011, 25% of our total assets consisted of goodwill, all of which isattributable to our manufacturing operations. In accordance with Financial Accounting StandardsBoard Accounting Standards Codification (FASB ASC) 350, IntangiblesGoodwill and Other (ASC350), we review goodwill at least annually for impairment by reporting unit and record animpairment charge if the implied fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, is less thanits carrying value. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge the impairment as an expense in theperiod in which the impairment occurred. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results of Operations  Critical Accounting Policies and Note 1 to our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements. Our goodwill could be impaired if developments affecting our manufacturingoperations or the markets in which we produce manufactured homes lead us to conclude that the cashflows we expect to derive from our manufacturing operations will be substantially reduced. A writeoff of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.The cyclical and seasonal nature of the manufactured housing industry causes our revenues andoperating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in thefutureThe manufactured housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by manynational and regional economic and demographic factors including the availability of consumerfinancing for homebuyers, the availability of wholesale financing for retailers, seasonality ofdemand, consumer confidence, interest rates, demographic and employment trends, income levels,housing demand, general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions, and theavailability of suitable home sites.As a result of the foregoing economic, demographic and other factors, our revenues andoperating results fluctuate, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover,we have and may continue to experience operating losses during cyclical downturns in themanufactured housing market. 13Table of ContentsOur liquidity and ability to raise capital may be limitedWe may need to obtain debt or additional equity financing in the future. The type, timing andterms of the financing selected by us will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, theavailability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. Therecan be no assurance that any of these sources will be available to us at any time or that they willbe available on satisfactory terms.We have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industryretailersIn accordance with customary business practice in the manufactured housing industry, we haveentered into repurchase agreements with various financial institutions and other credit sources whoprovide floor plan financing to industry retailers, which provide that we will be obligated, undercertain circumstances, to repurchase homes sold to retailers in the event of a default by aretailer in its obligation to such credit sources. Under these agreements, we have agreed torepurchase homes at declining prices over the term of the agreement (which in most cases is 18 to36 months). The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements wasapproximately $11.1 million as of March 31, 2011, without reduction for the resale value of thehomes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incuradditional expense as a consequence of these repurchase agreements.The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive, and competition may increase the adverseeffects of industry conditionsThe manufactured housing industry is highly competitive. Competition at both themanufacturing and retail levels is based upon several factors, including price, product features,reputation for service and quality, merchandising, terms of retailer promotional programs and theterms of retail customer financing. Numerous companies produce manufactured homes in our markets.In addition, our homes compete with repossessed homes that are offered for sale in our markets.Certain of our manufacturing competitors also have their own retail distribution systems andconsumer finance and insurance operations. The ability to offer consumer finance and insuranceproducts may provide some competitors with an advantage. In addition, there are many independentmanufactured housing retail locations in most areas where we have retail operations. We believethat where wholesale floor plan financing is available, it is relatively easy for new retailers toenter into our markets as competitors. In addition, our products compete with other forms of lowto moderate-cost housing, including new and existing site-built homes, apartments, townhouses andcondominiums. If we are unable to compete effectively in this environment, our retail andwholesale sales could be reduced.If we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent retailers who sell ourhomes, our sales could declineDuring fiscal year 2011, approximately 97% of our wholesale sales of manufactured homes wereto independent retail locations. As is common in the industry, independent retailers may also sellhomes produced by competing manufacturers. We may not be able to establish relationships with newindependent retailers or maintain good relationships with independent retailers that sell ourhomes. Even if we do establish and maintain relationships with independent retailers, theseretailers are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively, and may choose to sell our competitorshomes instead. The independent retailers with whom we have relationships can cancel theserelationships on short notice. In addition, these retailers may not remain financially solvent, asthey are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends similar to those faced byus. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent retailers in one ormore of our markets, sales in those markets could decline.Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and the pricing andavailability of raw materialsThe homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other laborrelated issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and oursubcontractors in one or more of our markets including high employment levels, construction marketconditions and government regulation which include laws and regulations related to workers healthand safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. An overall labor shortage or a lack ofskilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes whichcould have a material adverse effect upon our sales and results of operations.Our results of operations can be affected by the pricing and availability of raw materials.Although we attempt to increase thesales prices of our homes in response to higher materials costs, such increases typically lagbehind the escalation of materials costs. Sudden increases in price and lack of availability ofraw materials can be caused by natural disaster or other market forces, as has occurred in recentyears. Although we have not experienced any production halts, severe or prolonged shortages ofsome of our most important building materials, which include wood and wood products, gypsumwallboard, steel, insulation, and other petroleum-based products, have occurred. There can be noassurance that sufficient supplies of these and other raw materials will continue to be availableto us. 14Table of ContentsIf the manufactured housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, oursales could decline and our business could be adversely affectedManufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoningordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways.In the past, property owners often have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting thelocation of manufactured homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth ofthe industry. Manufactured homes may not achieve widespread acceptance and localities may notadopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of manufactured home communities. If themanufactured housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our salescould decline and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.The loss of any of our executive officers could reduce our ability to execute our business strategyand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operationsWe are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our executive officers,particularly Joseph H. Stegmayer, our Chief Executive Officer, Daniel L. Urness, our ChiefFinancial Officer, and Charles E. Lott, President of Fleetwood Homes. The loss of the services ofone or more of our executive officers could impair our ability to execute our business strategy andhave a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations.We currently have no key man life insurance for our executive officers.Certain provisions of our organizational documents could delay or make more difficult a change incontrol of our CompanyCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws coulddelay or make more difficult transactions involving a change of control of our Company, and mayhave the effect of entrenching our current management or possibly depressing the market price ofour common stock. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylawsauthorize blank series preferred stock, establish a staggered board of directors and impose certainprocedural and other requirements for stockholder proposals. Furthermore, the fact that incometaxes could be imposed as a result of ownership changes occurring in conjunction with adistribution may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult certain transactionsinvolving a change of control of our Company.Volatility of Stock PriceThe price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon a number of factors, manyof which are beyond our control. These factors include the perceived prospects of our business andthe manufactured housing industry as a whole; differences between our actual financial andoperating results and those expected by investors and analysts; changes in analystsrecommendations or projections; changes affecting the availability of financing in the wholesaleand consumer lending markets; actions or announcements by competitors; changes in the regulatoryenvironment in which we operate; and changes in general economic or market conditions. Inaddition, stock markets generally experience significant price and volume volatility from time totime which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to ourperformance.Deterioration in economic conditions in general and continued turmoil in the credit markets couldreduce our earnings and financial conditionDeterioration in global economic conditions and continued turmoil in the credit markets couldhave a negative impact on our business. Among other things, unfavorable changes in employmentlevels, job growth, consumer confidence and income, and interest rates may further reduce demandfor our products, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financialcondition. Unprecedented contraction in the credit markets and the financial services industry haveoccurred in recent years, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or consolidation of variousfinancial institutions and extraordinary intervention from the federal government. These factorscould have an adverse affect on the availability of financing to our customers, causing ourrevenues to decline.Our participation in certain wholesale financing programs for the purchase of our products byindustry retailers may expose us to additional risk of credit loss, which could adversely impactthe Companys liquidity and results of operationsWe are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of certain customers and businesspartners, including independent retailers, developers and inventory financing partners, many ofwhom may be adversely affected by the volatile conditions in the economy and financial markets.These conditions could result in financial instability or other adverse effects at any of ourcustomers or business partners. The consequences of such adverse effects could includedelinquencies by retailers who purchase our product under special inventory financing initiativesand deterioration of collateral values. In addition, we may incur losses if our collateral cannotbe recovered or liquidated at prices sufficient to recover recorded notes receivable balances. Weexpect to expand our participation in certain wholesale financing programs in connection with anygeneral increase in wholesale order activity and the operation of Palm Harbors manufacturingbusiness subsequent to the Acquisition Date. The realization of any of these factors may adverselyaffect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition. 15Table of Contents"

A writeoff of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our results of operations and financialcondition.The cyclical and seasonal nature of the manufactured housing industry causes our revenues andoperating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in thefutureThe manufactured housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by manynational and regional economic and demographic factors including the availability of consumerfinancing for homebuyers, the availability of wholesale financing for retailers, seasonality ofdemand, consumer confidence, interest rates, demographic and employment trends, income levels,housing demand, general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions, and theavailability of suitable home sites.As a result of the foregoing economic, demographic and other factors, our revenues andoperating results fluctuate, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover,we have and may continue to experience operating losses during cyclical downturns in themanufactured housing market.Our liquidity and ability to raise capital may be limitedWe may need to obtain debt or additional equity financing in the future. The type, timing andterms of the financing selected by us will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, theavailability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. Therecan be no assurance that any of these sources will be available to us at any time or that they willbe available on satisfactory terms.We have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industryretailersIn accordance with customary business practice in the manufactured housing industry, we haveentered into repurchase agreements with various financial institutions and other credit sources whoprovide floor plan financing to industry retailers, which provide that we will be obligated, undercertain circumstances, to repurchase homes sold to retailers in the event of a default by aretailer in its obligation to such credit sources. Under these agreements, we have agreed torepurchase homes at declining prices over the term of the agreement (which in most cases is 18 to36 months). The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements wasapproximately $12.7 million as of March 31, 2010, without reduction for the resale value of thehomes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incuradditional expense as a consequence of these repurchase agreements.The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive, and competition may increase the adverseeffects of industry conditionsThe manufactured housing industry is highly competitive. Competition at both themanufacturing and retail levels is based upon several factors, including price, product features,reputation for service and quality, merchandising, terms of retailer promotional programs and theterms of retail customer financing. Numerous companies produce manufactured homes in our markets.In addition, our homes compete with repossessed homes that are offered for sale in our markets.Certain of our manufacturing competitors also have their own retail distribution systems andconsumer finance and insurance operations. The ability to offer consumer finance andinsurance products may provide some competitors with an advantage. In addition, there aremany independent manufactured housing retail locations in most areas where we have retailoperations. We believe that where wholesale floor plan financing is available, it is relativelyeasy for new retailers to enter into our markets as competitors. In addition, our products competewith other forms of low to moderate-cost housing, including new and existing site-built homes,apartments, townhouses and condominiums. If we are unable to compete effectively in thisenvironment, our retail and wholesale sales could be reduced. 10Table of ContentsIf we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent retailers who sell ourhomes, our sales could declineDuring fiscal year 2010, approximately 97% of our wholesale sales of manufactured homes wereto independent retail locations. As is common in the industry, independent retailers may also sellhomes produced by competing manufacturers. We may not be able to establish relationships with newindependent retailers or maintain good relationships with independent retailers that sell ourhomes. Even if we do establish and maintain relationships with independent retailers, theseretailers are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively, and may choose to sell our competitorshomes instead. The independent retailers with whom we have relationships can cancel theserelationships on short notice. In addition, these retailers may not remain financially solvent, asthey are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonal trends similar to those faced byus. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solvent independent retailers in one ormore of our markets, sales in those markets could decline.Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and the pricing andavailability of raw materialsThe homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other laborrelated issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and oursubcontractors in one or more of our markets including high employment levels, construction marketconditions and government regulation which include laws and regulations related to workers healthand safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. An overall labor shortage or a lack ofskilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes whichcould have a material adverse effect upon our sales and results of operations.Our results of operations can be affected by the pricing and availability of raw materials.Although we attempt to increase the sales prices of our homes in response to higher materialscosts, such increases typically lag behind the escalation of materials costs. Sudden increases inprice and lack of availability of raw materials can be caused by natural disaster or other marketforces, as has occurred in recent years. Although we have not experienced any production halts,severe or prolonged shortages of some of our most important building materials, which include woodand wood products, gypsum wallboard, steel, insulation, and other petroleum-based products, haveoccurred. There can be no assurance that sufficient supplies of these and other raw materials willcontinue to be available to us.If the manufactured housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, oursales could decline and our business could be adversely affectedManufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoningordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways.In the past, property owners often have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting thelocation of manufactured homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth ofthe industry. Manufactured homes may not achieve widespread acceptance and localities may notadopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of manufactured home communities. If themanufactured housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our salescould decline and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.The loss of any of our executive officers could reduce our ability to execute our business strategyand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operationsWe are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our executive officers,particularly Joseph H. Stegmayer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Daniel L. Urness, our ChiefFinancial Officer. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could impairour ability to execute our business strategy and have a material adverse effect upon our business,financial condition and results of operations. We currently have no key man life insurance for ourexecutive officers.Certain provisions of our organizational documents could delay or make more difficult a change incontrol of our CompanyCertain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws coulddelay or make more difficult transactions involving a change of control of our Company, and mayhave the effect of entrenching our current management or possibly depressing the market price ofour common stock. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylawsauthorize blank series preferred stock, establish a staggered board of directors and impose certainprocedural and other requirements for stockholder proposals. Furthermore, the fact that incometaxes could be imposed as a result of ownership changes occurring in conjunction with adistribution may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult certain transactionsinvolving a change of control of our Company. 11Table of ContentsVolatility of Stock PriceThe price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon a number of factors, manyof which are beyond our control. These factors include the perceived prospects of our business andthe manufactured housing industry as a whole; differences between our actual financial andoperating results and those expected by investors and analysts; changes in analystsrecommendations or projections; changes affecting the availability of financing in the wholesaleand consumer lending markets; actions or announcements by competitors; changes in the regulatoryenvironment in which we operate; and changes in general economic or market conditions. Inaddition, stock markets generally experience significant price and volume volatility from time totime which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to ourperformance.Deterioration in economic conditions in general and continued turmoil in the credit markets couldreduce our earnings and financial conditionDeterioration in global economic conditions and continued turmoil in the credit markets couldhave a negative impact on our business. Among other things, unfavorable changes in employmentlevels, job growth, consumer confidence and income, and interest rates may further reduce demandfor our products, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, and financialcondition. Unprecedented contraction in the credit markets and the financial services industry haveoccurred recently, characterized by the bankruptcy, failure or consolidation of various financialinstitutions and extraordinary intervention from the federal government. These factors could havean adverse affect on the availability of financing to our customers, causing our revenues todecline.We may not be able to successfully integrate Fleetwood Homes and any future acquisition or attainthe anticipated benefits and the acquisition of Fleetwood Homes and other future acquisitions mayadversely impact the Companys liquidityWe completed the acquisition of certain manufactured housing assets and liabilities ofFleetwood Homes in fiscal year 2010. We may also consider other strategic acquisitions if suchopportunities arise. Any transactions that we consider may involve a number of risks including thediversion of our managements attention from our existing business for those transactions that wecomplete, or possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process andon our liquidity. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate,operate, maintain and manage the newly acquired operations or employees of Fleetwood Homes orpotential future acquisitions. We may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls,procedures and policies, which may lead to operational inefficiencies.Our participation in certain wholesale financing programs for the purchase of our products byindustry retailers may expose us to additional risk of credit loss, which could adversely impactthe Companys liquidity and results of operationsWe are exposed to risks associated with the creditworthiness of certain customers and businesspartners, including independent retailers and inventory financing partners, many of whom may beadversely affected by the volatile conditions in the financial markets. These conditions couldresult in financial instability or other adverse effects at any of our customers or businesspartners. The consequences of such adverse effects could include delinquencies by retailers whopurchase our product under special inventory financing initiatives and deterioration of collateralvalues. In addition, we may incur losses if our collateral cannot be recovered or liquidated atprices sufficient to recover recorded notes receivable balances. The realization of any of thesefactors may adversely affect our cash flow, profitability and financial condition"
7,CVCO,CAVCO INDUSTRIES INC,2009-05-21,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSOur business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider thefollowing risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The risksdescribed below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to usor that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect ourfinancial condition or results of operations.We operate in an industry that is currently experiencing a prolonged and significant downturnSince mid-1999, the manufactured housing industry has experienced a prolonged and significantdownturn. This downturn has resulted in part from the fact that, beginning in 1999, consumerlenders in the sector began to tighten underwriting standards and curtail credit availability inresponse to higher than anticipated rates of loan defaults and significant losses upon therepossession and resale of manufactured homes securing defaulted loans. In more recent years, theindustrys downturn was exacerbated by the aggressive financing methods utilized by developers andmarketers of standard site-built homes which had the effect of diverting potential manufacturedhousing customers to more expensive site-built homes, the global credit crisis, and generaldeterioration of economic conditions. These factors have resulted in declining wholesale shipmentsand excess manufacturing and retail locations.As a result of the foregoing factors, based on industry data as of the end of 2008, anestimated 68% of all industry retail locations have closed since the end of 1999 and the number ofactive industry manufacturing facilities has dropped by 153 plants over the same period,representing a 47% reduction. 8Table of ContentsThe availability of consumer financing for the purchase of manufactured homes continues to beconstrained, as discussed below. Although it is difficult to predict future industry conditions,the current market environment tends to indicate that a sustained recovery in the manufacturedhousing industry is unlikely to occur in the near term.If current industry conditions continue or get materially worse, we may be required to takesteps in an attempt to mitigate the effect of unfavorable industry conditions, such as the closureof facilities or consolidation of existing operations. These steps could impair our ability toconduct our business in a manner consistent with past practice and could make it more difficult forus to expand our operations if and when industry conditions improve. Furthermore, some of thesesteps could lead to fixed asset impairment charges and goodwill impairment charges.Tightened credit standards and curtailed lending activity by home-only lenders have contributed toa constrained consumer financing marketConsumers who buy our manufactured homes have historically secured retail financing fromthird-party lenders. The availability, terms and costs of retail financing depend on the lendingpractices of financial institutions, governmental policies and economic and other conditions, allof which are beyond our control. A consumer seeking to finance the purchase of a manufactured homewithout land will generally pay a higher interest rate and have a shorter loan maturity than aconsumer seeking to finance the purchase of land and the home. In addition, home-only financing isat times more difficult to obtain than financing for site-built homes. Since 1999, home-onlylenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards and increased interest rates for loans topurchase manufactured homes, which has reduced lending volumes which has negatively impacted oursales. In addition, most of the national lenders who have historically provided home-only loanshave exited this sector of the industry. Conseco Finance was historically one of the largestoriginators of home-only loans in the manufactured housing industry. In December 2002, ConsecoInc., the parent company of Conseco Finance Corp., filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased itslending activities. In May 2004, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., the lender with the largest loanorigination volume in the home-only financing market at that time, announced it was ceasing itsmanufactured housing lending activities. In March 2008, Origen Financial, Inc. (Origen)announced that it was suspending originations of manufactured home loans as a result of unfavorableconditions in the secondary market for its loans. Some of our retailers have utilized Origen tofinance consumer loans. Another major lender, 21st Mortgage Corporation, citingunreliable and inadequate sources of funding, announced in January 2009 that it was significantlycurtailing its retail lending program. Remaining retail lenders such as Triad Financial, US Bank,and CU Factory Built Lending have tightened their loan underwriting standards. If other lenders donot absorb the volume of loans previously made by these lenders, we could experience retail andmanufacturing sales declines.The availability of wholesale financing for industry retailers is limited due to a reduced numberof floor plan lenders and reduced lending limitsManufactured housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesalefloor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing issignificantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. During thepast seven years, a substantial number of wholesale lenders have exited the industry or curtailedtheir floor plan operations. Conseco Finance was historically the largest floor plan lender,previously providing about 25% of the industrys wholesale financing. Conseco Finance discontinuedapproving and funding new floor plan loan requests in April 2002 and filed for bankruptcyprotection in December 2002. With Consecos exit, Deutsche Financial Services was the largestremaining floor plan lender, providing approximately 20% of the industrys wholesale financing.Deutsche Financial Services discontinued approving and funding new floor plan loan requests inNovember 2002 and proceeded to liquidate its existing floor plan receivables. In recent years, theCompanys independent retailers have relied primarily on GE Commercial Distribution Finance,Textron Financial Corporation and 21st Mortgage Corporation, national lendinginstitutions that have specialized in providing wholesale floor plan financing to manufacturedhousing retailers. As a result of the current credit crisis, during the third quarter of fiscalyear 2009, each of these remaining national floor plan lenders substantially curtailed theirlending activities, and Textron Financial Corporation announced its intention to exit the business.We are concerned that floor plan financing providers could further reduce their levels of floorplan lending. Reduced availability of floor plan lending may affect the inventory levels of ourindependent retailers, the number of retail sales center locations and related wholesale demand,and may also have an adverse effect on the availability of and our access to capital on an ongoingbasis.Our operating results could be affected by geographic concentration and declining housing demandAs a participant in the homebuilding industry, we are subject to market forces beyond ourcontrol. These market forces include employment and employment growth, interest rates, landavailability and development costs, apartment vacancy levels, and the health of the generaleconomy.  Unfavorable changes in any of the above factors or other issues could have an adverseeffect on our sales and earnings. In addition, our sales are largely concentrated in Arizona andCalifornia, which have experienced significant declines in industry shipments in calendar years2006, 2007, 2008 and early 2009.  9Table of ContentsWe have incurred net losses in prior periods and there can be no assurance that we will generateincome in the futureAlthough we generated income from continuing operations during the past eight fiscal years, wehave incurred net losses in prior years. Net losses in these years were attributable insubstantial part to the downturn affecting the manufactured housing industry, which is discussed indetail below. The likelihood that we will generate net income in the future must be considered inlight of the difficulties facing the manufactured housing industry as a whole, economic conditions,the competitive environment in which we operate and the other risks and uncertainties discussed inthis Annual Report. There can be no assurance that we will generate net income in the future.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and networthA substantial portion of our total assets at March 31, 2009 consisted of goodwill, all ofwhich is attributable to our manufacturing operations. In particular, goodwill accounted forapproximately 38% of our total assets at March 31, 2009. Effective in fiscal year 2002, we adoptedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.As a result, we no longer amortize goodwill. Instead, we review goodwill at least annually todetermine whether it has become impaired. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge theimpairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurred. See ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical AccountingPolicies and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

In particular, goodwill accounted forapproximately 37% of our total assets at March 31, 2008. Effective in fiscal year 2002, we adoptedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.As a result, we no longer amortize goodwill. Instead, we review goodwill at least annually todetermine whether it has become impaired. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge theimpairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurred.

A write off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affectour results of operations and financial condition.The cyclical and seasonal nature of the manufactured housing industry causes our revenues andoperating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in thefuture     The manufactured housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by manynational and regional economic and demographic factors, including:  the availability of consumer financing for homebuyers;   the availability of wholesale financing for retailers;   seasonality of demand;   consumer confidence;   interest rates;   demographic and employment trends;   income levels;   housing demand;   general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions; and   the availability of suitable homesites.9Table of Contents     As a result of the foregoing economic, demographic and other factors, our revenues andoperating results fluctuate, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover,we may experience operating losses during cyclical downturns in the manufactured housing market.Our liquidity and ability to raise capital may be limited     We may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future. The type, timing andterms of the financing selected by us will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, theavailability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. Therecan be no assurance that any of these sources will be available to us at any time or that they willbe available on satisfactory terms.Tightened credit standards and curtailed lending activity by home-only lenders have contributed toa constrained consumer financing market     Consumers who buy our manufactured homes have historically secured retail financing fromthird-party lenders. The availability, terms and costs of retail financing depend on the lendingpractices of financial institutions, governmental policies and economic and other conditions, allof which are beyond our control. A consumer seeking to finance the purchase of a manufactured homewithout land will generally pay a higher interest rate and have a shorter loan maturity than aconsumer seeking to finance the purchase of land and the home. In addition, home-only financing isat times more difficult to obtain than financing for site-built homes. Since 1999, home-onlylenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards and increased interest rates for loans topurchase manufactured homes, which has reduced lending volumes which has negatively impacted oursales. In addition, most of the national lenders who have historically provided home-only loanshave exited this sector of the industry. Conseco Finance was historically one of the largestoriginators of home-only loans in the manufactured housing industry. In December 2002, ConsecoInc., the parent company of Conseco Finance Corp., filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased itslending activities. In May 2004, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., the lender with the largest loanorigination volume in the home-only financing market at that time, announced it was ceasing itsmanufactured housing lending activities. In March 2008, Origen Financial, Inc. (Origen)announced that it was suspending originations of manufactured home loans as a result of unfavorableconditions in the secondary market for its loans. Some of our retailers have utilized Origen tofinance consumer loans. If other lenders do not absorb the volume of loans previously made byOrigen, we could experience retail and manufacturing sales declines.The availability of wholesale financing for industry retailers is limited due to a reduced numberof floor plan lenders and reduced lending limits     Manufactured housing retailers generally finance their inventory purchases with wholesalefloor plan financing provided by lending institutions. The availability of wholesale financing issignificantly affected by the number of floor plan lenders and their lending limits. During thepast seven years, a substantial number of wholesale lenders have exited the industry or curtailedtheir floor plan operations. Conseco Finance was historically the largest floor plan lender,previously providing about 25% of the industrys wholesale financing. Conseco Finance discontinuedapproving and funding new floor plan loan requests in April 2002 and filed for bankruptcyprotection in December 2002. With Consecos exit, Deutsche Financial Services was the largestremaining floor plan lender, providing approximately 20% of the industrys wholesale financing.Deutsche Financial Services discontinued approving and funding new floor plan loan requests inNovember 2002 and proceeded to liquidate its existing floor plan receivables. The Companysindependent retailers currently rely primarily on GE Commercial Distribution Finance, TextronFinancial Corporation and 21st Mortgage Corporation, which are national lendinginstitutions that specialize in providing wholesale floor plan financing to manufactured housingretailers. We are concerned that floor plan financing providers could reduce their levels of floorplan lending. Reduced availability of floor plan lending may affect the inventory levels of ourindependent retailers, their number of retail sales centers and related wholesale demand, and mayalso have an adverse effect on our access to capital on an ongoing basis.We have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industryretailers     In accordance with customary business practice in the manufactured housing industry, we haveentered into repurchase agreements with various financial institutions and other credit sources whoprovide floor plan financing to industry retailers, which provide that we will be obligated, undercertain circumstances, to repurchase homes sold to retailers in the event of a default by aretailer in its obligation to such credit sources. Under these agreements, we have agreed torepurchase homes at declining prices over the term of the agreement (which in most cases is 18 to24 months). The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements wasapproximately $24.1 million as of March 31, 2008, without reduction for the resale value of thehomes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incuradditional expense as a consequence of these repurchase agreements.10Table of ContentsThe manufactured housing industry is highly competitive, and competition may increase the adverseeffects of industry conditions     The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive. Competition at both themanufacturing and retail levels is based upon several factors, including price, product features,reputation for service and quality, merchandising, terms of retailer promotional programs and theterms of retail customer financing. Numerous companies produce manufactured homes in our markets.In addition, our homes compete with repossessed homes that are offered for sale in our markets. Anumber of our manufacturing competitors also have their own retail distribution systems andconsumer finance and insurance operations. The ability to offer consumer finance and insuranceproducts may provide some competitors with an advantage. In addition, there are many independentmanufactured housing retail locations in most areas where we have retail operations. We believethat where wholesale floor plan financing is available, it is relatively easy for new retailers toenter into our markets as competitors. In addition, our products compete with other forms of lowto moderate-cost housing, including new and existing site-built homes, apartments, townhouses andcondominiums. If we are unable to compete effectively in this environment, our retail sales andwholesale shipments could be reduced. As a result, our growth could be limited.If we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent retailers who sell ourhomes, our sales could decline     During fiscal year 2008, approximately 95% of our wholesale shipments of manufactured homeswere made to independent retail locations in the United States. As is common in the industry,independent retailers may sell homes produced by competing manufacturers. We may not be able toestablish relationships with new independent retailers or maintain good relationships withindependent retailers that sell our homes. Even if we do establish and maintain relationships withindependent retailers, these retailers are not obligated to sell our homes exclusively, and maychoose to sell our competitors homes instead. The independent retailers with whom we haverelationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, these retailers may notremain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic, demographic and seasonaltrends similar to the ones we face. If we do not establish and maintain relationships with solventindependent retailers in one or more of our markets, sales in those markets could decline.Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and the pricing andavailability of raw materials     The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other laborrelated issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and oursubcontractors in one or more of our markets including high employment levels, construction marketconditions and government regulation which include laws and regulations related to workers healthand safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. An overall labor shortage or a lack ofskilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes whichcould have a material adverse effect upon our sales and profitability.     Our results of operations can be affected by the pricing and availability of raw materials.Although we attempt to increase the sales prices of our homes in response to higher materialscosts, such increases typically lag behind the escalation of materials costs. Sudden increases inprice and lack of availability of raw materials can be caused by natural disaster or other marketforces, as has occurred in recent years. Although we have not experienced any production halts,severe or prolonged shortages of some of our most important building materials, which include woodand wood products, gypsum wallboard, steel, insulation, and other petroleum-based products, haveoccurred. There can be no assurance that sufficient supplies of these and other raw materials willcontinue to be available to us.If the manufactured housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, oursales could decline and our business could be adversely affected     Manufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoningordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways.In the past, property owners often have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting thelocation of manufactured homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth ofthe industry. Manufactured homes may not achieve widespread acceptance and localities may notadopt zoning ordinances permitting the development of manufactured home communities. If themanufactured housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, our salescould decline and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected.The loss of any of our executive officers could reduce our ability to execute our business strategyand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations     We are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our executive officers,particularly Joseph H. Stegmayer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Daniel L. Urness, our ChiefFinancial Officer. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could impairour ability to execute our business strategy and have a material adverse effect upon our business,financial condition and results of operations. We currently have no key man life insurance for ourexecutive officers.11Table of ContentsCertain provisions of our organizational documents could delay or make more difficult a change incontrol of our Company     Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws coulddelay or make more difficult transactions involving a change of control of our Company, and mayhave the effect of entrenching our current management or possibly depressing the market price ofour common stock. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylawsauthorize blank series preferred stock, establish a staggered board of directors and impose certainprocedural and other requirements for stockholder proposals. Furthermore, the fact that incometaxes could be imposed as a result of ownership changes occurring in conjunction with thedistribution may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult certain transactionsinvolving a change of control of our Company.Volatility of Stock Price     The price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon a number of factors, manyof which are beyond our control. These factors include the perceived prospects of our business andthe manufactured housing industry as a whole; differences between our actual financial andoperating results and those expected by investors and analysts; changes in analystsrecommendations or projections; changes affecting the availability of financing in the wholesaleand consumer lending markets; actions or announcements by competitors; changes in the regulatoryenvironment in which we operate; and changes in general economic or market conditions.

9,CVCO,CAVCO INDUSTRIES INC,2007-05-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     Our business involves a number of risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider thefollowing risks, together with the information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report. The risksdescribed below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks that are currently unknown to usor that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect ourfinancial condition or results of operations.We have incurred net losses in prior periods and there can be no assurance that we will generateincome in the future     Although we generated income from continuing operations during the past six fiscal years, wehave incurred net losses in prior years. Net losses in these years were attributable insubstantial part to the downturn affecting the manufactured housing industry, which is discussed indetail below. The likelihood that we will generate net income in the future must be considered inlight of the difficulties facing the manufactured housing industry as a whole, as well as thecompetitive environment in which we operate and the other risks and uncertainties discussed in thisAnnual Report. There can be no assurance that we will generate net income in the future.We operate in an industry that is currently experiencing a prolonged and significant downturn     Since mid-1999, the manufactured housing industry has experienced a prolonged and significantdownturn. This downturn has resulted in part from the fact that, beginning in 1999, consumerlenders in the sector began to tighten underwriting standards and curtail credit availability inresponse to higher than anticipated rates of loan defaults and significant losses upon therepossession and resale of homes securing defaulted loans. Other causes of the downturn include areduced number of consumer lenders in the traditional chattel (home-only) lending sector, higherinterest rates on home-only loans and generally unfavorable economic conditions. These factorsresulted in declining wholesale shipments, excess manufacturing and retail locations and surplusinventory.     As a result of the foregoing factors, based on industry data as of the end of 2006,approximately 57% of all industry retail locations have closed since the end of 1999 and the numberof active industry manufacturing facilities has dropped by 118 plants over the same period,representing a 37% reduction.     The availability of consumer financing for the purchase of manufactured homes continues to beconstrained, as discussed below. Although it is difficult to predict future industry conditions,the current market environment tends to indicate that a sustained recovery in the manufacturedhousing industry is unlikely to occur in the near term.     If current industry conditions get materially worse, we may incur operating and net losses,and may be required to take steps in an attempt to mitigate the effect of unfavorable industryconditions, such as the closure of facilities or consolidation of existing operations. These stepscould impair our ability to conduct our business in a manner consistent with past practice andcould make it more difficult for us to expand our operations if and when industry conditions improve. Furthermore, some ofthese steps could lead to fixed asset impairment charges and goodwill impairment charges.8Table of ContentsHousing demand and geographic concentration     As a participant in the homebuilding industry, we are subject to market forces beyond ourcontrol. These include employment and employment growth, interest rates, land availability anddevelopment costs, apartment vacancy levels, and the health of the general economy. Unfavorablechanges in any of the above factors or other issues could have an adverse affect on our sales andearnings. In addition, our sales are largely concentrated in Arizona and California, which haveexperienced significant declines in industry shipments in 2006 and early 2007.A write-off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affect our operating results and networth     A substantial portion of our total assets at March 31, 2007 consisted of goodwill, all ofwhich is attributable to our manufacturing operations. In particular, goodwill accounted forapproximately 39% of our total assets at March 31, 2007. Effective in fiscal 2002, we adoptedStatement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets.As a result, we no longer amortize goodwill. Instead, we review goodwill at least annually todetermine whether it has become impaired. If goodwill has become impaired, we charge theimpairment as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurred. See ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Critical AccountingPolicies and Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Our goodwill could be impaired ifdevelopments affecting our manufacturing operations or the markets in which we produce manufacturedhomes lead us to conclude that the cash flows we expect to derive from our manufacturing operationswill be substantially reduced. A write off of all or part of our goodwill could adversely affectour results of operations and financial condition.The cyclical and seasonal nature of the manufactured housing industry causes our revenues andoperating results to fluctuate, and we expect this cyclicality and seasonality to continue in thefuture     The manufactured housing industry is highly cyclical and seasonal and is influenced by manynational and regional economic and demographic factors, including:  the availability of consumer financing for homebuyers;   the availability of wholesale financing for retailers;   seasonality of demand;   consumer confidence;   interest rates;   demographic and employment trends;   income levels;   housing demand;   general economic conditions, including inflation and recessions; and   the availability of suitable homesites.As a result of the foregoing economic, demographic and other factors, our revenues and operatingresults fluctuate, and we expect them to continue to fluctuate in the future. Moreover, we mayexperience operating losses during cyclical downturns in the manufactured housing market.Our liquidity and ability to raise capital may be limited     We may need to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future. The type, timing andterms of the financing selected by us will depend on, among other things, our cash needs, theavailability of other financing sources and prevailing conditions in the financial markets. Therecan be no assurance that any of these sources will be available to us at any time or that they willbe available on satisfactory terms.9Table of ContentsTightened credit standards and curtailed lending activity by home-only lenders have contributed toa constrained consumer financing market     Consumers who buy our manufactured homes have historically secured retail financing fromthird-party lenders. The availability, terms and costs of retail financing depend on the lendingpractices of financial institutions, governmental policies and economic and other conditions, allof which are beyond our control. A consumer seeking to finance the purchase of a manufactured homewithout land will generally pay a higher interest rate and have a shorter loan maturity than aconsumer seeking to finance the purchase of land and the home. In addition, home-only financing isat times more difficult to obtain than financing for site-built homes. Since 1999, home-onlylenders have tightened the credit underwriting standards and increased interest rates for loans topurchase manufactured homes, which has reduced lending volumes which has negatively impacted oursales. In addition, most of the national lenders who have historically provided home-only loanshave exited this sector of the industry. Conseco Finance was historically one of the largestoriginators of home-only loans in the manufactured housing industry. In December 2002, ConsecoInc., the parent company of Conseco Finance Corp., filed for bankruptcy protection and ceased itslending activities. In May 2004, JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., the lender with the largest loanorigination volume in the home-only financing market at that time, announced it was ceasing itsmanufactured housing lending activities.

We currently have no key man life insurance for ourexecutive officers.We could be responsible for certain tax liabilities if the Internal Revenue Service challenges thetax-free nature of the distribution     We previously operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centex Corporation (Centex). On June30, 2003, Centex distributed 100% of the outstanding shares of our common stock to the stockholdersof Centex. Upon this distribution we became a separate public company. Centex received a privateletter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect that the distribution of shares ofCavco common stock to stockholders of Centex was tax-free to its stockholders, except to the extentthat cash was received in lieu of fractional shares, and that Centex would not generally recognizeincome, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of the distribution. The rulingwas based on then current law and was subject to the accuracy of certain representations made byCentex in its request for the private letter ruling and certain assumptions regarding Centex and usthat are described in the ruling.     Although Centex and we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause therepresentations made by Centex in its request for the private letter ruling or the assumptions onwhich the ruling was based to be materially incorrect, no assurance can begiven in this regard. If any of these representations or assumptions were materiallyincorrect, and the Internal Revenue Service were to challenge the tax-free nature of thedistribution, it is possible that the distribution could be held to be a distribution taxable as adividend by Centex of our common stock to the stockholders of Centex for federal income taxpurposes.11Table of Contents     If the distribution were held to be a taxable distribution, Centex would be subject to tax tothe extent that the fair market value of our common stock exceeded the adjusted tax basis of Centexin our common stock at the time of the distribution. In addition, each holder of Centex commonstock who received shares of our common stock in the distribution would generally be treated ashaving received a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stockreceived at the time of the distribution (assuming that Centex had current or accumulated earningsand profits equal to the total value of the distribution).     Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement entered into between us and Centex, we have agreed, incertain circumstances, to indemnify Centex against any tax liability that is incurred as a resultof the failure of the distribution to qualify as a tax-free transaction. If we are required tomake this payment and the amount is significant, the payment could have a material adverse effecton our financial condition and results of operations.We may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to Centex, or may not be able tocollect on indemnification rights from Centex     We entered into a distribution agreement with Centex in connection with the distribution,which agreement allocates responsibility between Centex and us for various liabilities andobligations. For example, the distribution agreement provides that we and Centex will agree toindemnify one another against claims arising with respect to the indebtedness, liabilities andobligations that will be retained by our respective companies. The principal purpose for ourindemnification obligations is to provide assurance to Centex that we will bear all liabilitiesarising from the Cavco business and associated assets. Our ability to satisfy any suchindemnification obligations will depend upon the future financial strength of our Company. At thepresent time, although we cannot determine the amount for which we may be obligated to indemnifyCentex, we do not believe that the amount of our potential indemnification obligations is likely tobe material. We also cannot assure you that we will be successful in collecting on anyindemnification obligations that may be owing to us by Centex. If we or Centex were unable to fundor collect on these indemnification obligations, our financial condition and results of operationscould be adversely affected.Certain provisions of our organizational documents could delay or make more difficult a change incontrol of our Company     Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws coulddelay or make more difficult transactions involving a change of control of our Company, and mayhave the effect of entrenching our current management or possibly depressing the market price ofour common stock. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylawsauthorize blank series preferred stock, establish a staggered board of directors and impose certainprocedural and other requirements for stockholder proposals. Furthermore, the fact that incometaxes could be imposed as a result of ownership changes occurring in conjunction with thedistribution may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult certain transactionsinvolving a change of control of our Company.Volatility of Stock Price     The price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon a number of factors, manyof which are beyond our control.

The availability of consumer financing for the purchase of manufactured homes continuesto be constrained, as discussed below. In addition, the large number of repossessed homes beingoffered for sale continues to have an adverse impact on demand for new manufactured homes.Although it is difficult to predict future industry conditions, these factors tend to indicate thata sustained recovery in the manufactured housing industry is unlikely to occur in the near term.     If current industry conditions get materially worse, we may incur operating and net losses,and may be required to take steps in an attempt to mitigate the effect of unfavorable industryconditions, such as the closure of facilities or consolidation of existing operations.

During thepast five years, a substantial number of wholesale lenders have exited the industry or curtailedtheir floor plan operations. Conseco Finance was historically the largest floor plan lender,previously providing about 25% of the industrys wholesale financing. Conseco Finance discontinuedapproving and funding new floor plan loan requests in April 2002 and filed for bankruptcyprotection in December 2002. With Consecos exit, Deutsche Financial Services was the largestremaining floor plan lender, providing approximately 20% of the industrys wholesale financing.Deutsche Financial Services discontinued approving and funding new floor plan loan requests inNovember 2002 and proceeded to liquidate its existing floor plan receivables. There are currentlythree national lending institutions that specialize in providing wholesale floor plan financing tomanufactured housing retailers. Reduced availability of floor plan lending may affect theinventory levels of our independent retailers, their number of retail sales centers and relatedwholesale demand, and may also have an adverse effect on our access to capital on an ongoing basis.10Table of ContentsWe have contingent repurchase obligations related to wholesale financing provided to industryretailers     In accordance with customary business practice in the manufactured housing industry, we haveentered into repurchase agreements with various financial institutions and other credit sources whoprovide floor plan financing to industry retailers, which provide that we will be obligated, undercertain circumstances, to repurchase homes sold to retailers in the event of a default by aretailer in its obligation to such credit sources. Under these agreements, we have agreed torepurchase homes at declining prices over the term of the agreement (which in most cases is 18months). The maximum amount of our contingent obligations under such repurchase agreements wereapproximately $35.6 million as of March 31, 2006, without reduction for the resale value of thehomes. We may be required to honor contingent repurchase obligations in the future and may incuradditional expense as a consequence of these repurchase agreements.The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive, and competition may increase the adverseeffects of industry conditions     The manufactured housing industry is highly competitive. Competition at both themanufacturing and retail levels is based upon several factors, including price, product features,reputation for service and quality, merchandising, terms of retailer promotional programs and theterms of retail customer financing. Numerous companies produce manufactured homes in our markets.In addition, our homes compete with repossessed homes that are offered for sale in our markets. Anumber of our manufacturing competitors also have their own retail distribution systems andconsumer finance and insurance operations. The ability to offer consumer finance and insuranceproducts may provide some competitors with an advantage. In addition, there are many independentmanufactured housing retail locations in most areas where we have retail operations. We believethat where wholesale floor plan financing is available, it is relatively easy for new retailers toenter into our markets as competitors. In addition, our products compete with other forms of lowto moderate-cost housing, including new and existing site-built homes, apartments, townhouses andcondominiums. If we are unable to compete effectively in this environment, our retail sales andwholesale shipments could be reduced. As a result, our growth could be limited.If we are unable to establish or maintain relationships with independent retailers who sell ourhomes, our sales could decline     During fiscal 2006, approximately 96% of our wholesale shipments of manufactured homes weremade to independent retail locations in the United States. As is common in the industry,independent retailers may sell manufactured homes produced by competing manufacturers. We may notbe able to establish relationships with new independent retailers or maintain good relationshipswith independent retailers that sell our homes. Even if we do establish and maintain relationshipswith independent retailers, these retailers are not obligated to sell our manufactured homesexclusively, and may choose to sell our competitors homes instead. The independent retailers withwhom we have relationships can cancel these relationships on short notice. In addition, theseretailers may not remain financially solvent, as they are subject to industry, economic,demographic and seasonal trends similar to the ones we face. If we do not establish and maintainrelationships with solvent independent retailers in one or more of our markets, sales in thosemarkets could decline.Our results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages and the pricing andavailability of raw materials     The homebuilding industry has from time to time experienced labor shortages and other laborrelated issues. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us and oursubcontractors in one or more of our markets including high employment levels, construction marketconditions and government regulation which include laws and regulations related to workers healthand safety, wage and hour practices and immigration. An overall labor shortage or a lack ofskilled labor could cause significant increases in costs or delays in construction of homes whichcould have a material adverse effect upon our sales and profitability.     Our results of operations can be affected by the pricing and availability of raw materials.Although we attempt to increase the sales prices of our homes in response to higher materialscosts, such increases typically lag behind the escalation of materials costs. Sudden increases inprice and lack of availability of raw materials can be caused by natural disaster or other marketforces, as has occurred recently. Five of the most important raw materials used in our operations,wood and wood products, gypsum wallboard, steel, insulation, and other petroleum-based products andservices, including delivery costs, have experienced significant shortages and price increases inrecent periods. Although we have not experienced any production halts, severe or prolongedshortage of such building materials have occurred, and there can be no assurance that sufficientsupplies of these and other raw materials will continue to be available to us.If the manufactured housing industry is not able to secure favorable local zoning ordinances, oursales could decline and our business could be adversely affected     Manufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoningordinances and other local regulations relating to utility service and construction of roadways.In the past, property owners often have resisted the adoption of zoning ordinances permitting thelocation of manufactured homes in residential areas, which we believe has restricted the growth ofthe industry. Manufactured homes may not achieve widespread acceptance and localities may notadopt zoning ordinances permitting the11Table of Contentsdevelopment of manufactured home communities. If themanufactured housing industry is unable to secure favorable local zoningordinances, our sales could decline and our business, results of operations and financialcondition could be adversely affected.The loss of any of our executive officers could reduce our ability to execute our business strategyand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations     We are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our executive officers,particularly Joseph H. Stegmayer, our Chief Executive Officer, and Daniel L. Urness, our ChiefFinancial Officer. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could impairour ability to execute our business strategy and have a material adverse effect upon our business,financial condition and results of operations. We currently have no key man life insurance for ourexecutive officers.We have a limited operating history as an independent company     Prior to June 30, 2003, we operated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Centex. Accordingly, ourmanagement team has limited experience in operating our company as an independent public company.We no longer have any affiliation with Centex, and our ability to satisfy our obligations andachieve or maintain profitability is solely dependent upon the future performance of our business.In addition, our management team will need to comply with the numerous regulatory and otherrequirements applicable to independent public companies, including requirements relating tocorporate governance, listing standards and securities and investor relations issues.You may have difficulty evaluating our business, as our historical financial information may not berepresentative of what our results of operations would have been if we had been an independentcompany     Our historical financial statements included in this Annual Report may not reflect the resultsof operations, financial condition and cash flows that would have been achieved by our company hadwe been operated independently prior to June 30, 2003. We have not made adjustments to thisinformation to reflect changes that may have occurred in our cost structure, funding and operationsas a result of being an independent public company. Among other things, our historical financialstatements may not reflect the costs to us of borrowing funds as a stand-alone entity, additionalcompensation costs or the costs of complying with laws and regulations applicable to publiccompanies.We could be responsible for certain tax liabilities if the Internal Revenue Service challenges thetax-free nature of the distribution     Centex received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service to the effect thatthe distribution of shares of Cavco common stock to stockholders of Centex will be tax-free to itsstockholders, except to the extent that cash is received in lieu of fractional shares, and thatCentex will generally not recognize income, gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as aresult of the distribution. The ruling was based on then current law and was subject to theaccuracy of certain representations made by Centex in its request for the private letter ruling andcertain assumptions regarding Centex and us that are described in the ruling.     Although Centex and we are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause therepresentations made by Centex in its request for the private letter ruling or the assumptions onwhich the ruling was based to be materially incorrect, no assurance can be given in this regard.If any of these representations or assumptions were to prove to be materially incorrect, and theInternal Revenue Service were to challenge the tax-free nature of the distribution, it is possiblethat the distribution could be held to be a distribution taxable as a dividend by Centex of ourcommon stock to the stockholders of Centex for federal income tax purposes.     If the distribution were held to be a taxable distribution, Centex would be subject to tax tothe extent that the fair market value of our common stock exceeded the adjusted tax basis of Centexin our common stock at the time of the distribution. In addition, each holder of Centex commonstock who received shares of our common stock in the distribution would generally be treated ashaving received a taxable dividend in an amount equal to the fair market value of our common stockreceived at the time of the distribution (assuming that Centex had current or accumulated earningsand profits equal to the total value of the distribution).     Pursuant to the tax sharing agreement entered into between us and Centex, we have agreed, incertain circumstances, to indemnify Centex against any tax liability that is incurred as a resultof the failure of the distribution to qualify as a tax-free transaction. If we are required tomake this payment and the amount is significant, the payment could have a material adverse effecton our financial condition and results of operations.We may be required to satisfy certain indemnification obligations to Centex, or may not be able tocollect on indemnification rights from Centex     We entered into a distribution agreement with Centex in connection with the distribution,which agreement allocates responsibility between Centex and us for various liabilities andobligations. For example, the distribution agreement provides that we and Centex will agree toindemnify one another against claims arising with respect to the indebtedness, liabilities andobligations that will be retained by12Table of Contentsour respective companies. The principal purpose for ourindemnification obligations is to provide assurance to Centex that we will bearall liabilities arising from the Cavco business and associated assets. Our ability to satisfyany such indemnification obligations will depend upon the future financial strength of our company.At the present time, although we cannot determine the amount for which we may be obligated toindemnify Centex, we do not believe that the amount of our potential indemnification obligations islikely to be material. We also cannot assure you that we will be successful in collecting on anyindemnification obligations that may be owing to us by Centex. If we or Centex were unable to fundor collect on these indemnification obligations, our financial condition and results of operationscould be adversely affected.Certain provisions of our organizational documents could delay or make more difficult a change incontrol of our company     Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylaws coulddelay or make more difficult transactions involving a change of control of our company, and mayhave the effect of entrenching our current management or possibly depressing the market price ofour common stock. For example, our restated certificate of incorporation and restated bylawsauthorize blank series preferred stock, establish a staggered board of directors and impose certainprocedural and other requirements for stockholder proposals. Furthermore, the fact that incometaxes could be imposed as a result of ownership changes occurring in conjunction with thedistribution may have the effect of delaying or making more difficult certain transactionsinvolving a change of control of our company.Volatility of Stock Price     The price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending upon a number of factors, manyof which are beyond our control. These factors include the perceived prospects of our business andthe manufactured housing industry as a whole; differences between our actual financial andoperating results and those expected by investors and analysts; changes in analystsrecommendations or projections; changes affecting the availability of financing in the wholesaleand consumer lending markets; actions or announcements by competitors; changes in the regulatoryenvironment in which we operate; and changes in general economic or market conditions. Inaddition, stock markets generally experience significant price and volume volatility from time totime which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to ourperformance"
